### <center>紧紧依靠你的神</center>

> [!info]- 🎙️Audio: [A Daily Devotional - 03.17 - CN]()

当一个人临终时讲话，我们通常期待他或她说出一些重要的话。临终的演讲常常能揭示出一个人心中最看重的事情。在《约书亚记》23章中，我们看到约书亚为神的百姓所做的这样一次讲话。

约书亚的第一件事，就是提醒百姓神为他们所做的一切。他希望他们记得，神如何在他们进入这片土地时，为他们争战。约书亚所发出的每一个指示，都以这一重要的提醒为开端：神为他们争战，赐给他们胜利，并把应许的产业交给了他们。

随着约书亚讲话的继续，他关注的核心问题是我们曾多次听到的，但显然是他心头最重要的事。约书亚敦促百姓遵守律法，紧紧跟随神的话语。重点在于坚守神的话语，绝不偏离。在生命的最后时刻，在向神的百姓作出告别讲话时，约书亚强调他们对神话语的顺服和遵守。这是他最关切的事！为什么呢？因为，正如约书亚所说，神的话语使祂的百姓与周围的异教国家有所分别，保护他们远离罪恶和拜偶像。约书亚告诉他们，要持守神的话语，“免得你们与剩下的这些国民混杂在一起。”他们对神话语的忠心将帮助他们避免陷入罪恶（23:7）。

约书亚的讲话带着严肃的警告。如果他们不持守神的话语，且与周围的拜偶像的民族混杂在一起，神的惩罚将降临在他们身上，正是那些曾引诱他们偏离神道的民族，将给他们带来痛苦和灾难。对于神的百姓来说，只有一条路可以走：那就是严格按照唯一真神的话语行走，决不偏离。

> [!important]+ 反思与回应
约书亚的命令对我们今天的神的百姓同样适用！神已经通过基督拯救了我们，祂为我们完成了奇妙的救赎工作。我们应当回应这一恩典，每一天都建立在祂完美的话语上。今天请向神祷告，求祂赐给你力量，紧紧跟随祂，完全按照祂的话语行走，毫不偏离。

> [!question]+ Review
> 1. ⁠ ⁠Why does God remind Joshua in Joshua 13 that there is still much land to be conquered? What does this mean for Israel's future?
> 2. ⁠Joshua 13:13 mentions that the Israelites did not drive out the Geshurites and the Maacathites. What spiritual lessons can we learn from this passage?

📖 **Passage to read**: ==Joshua 23==

> [!info]- 🎙️Audio: [A Daily Devotional - 03.18 - EN]()  

When someone speaks near the end of their life, we expect their words to be important. Final speeches often show us what matters most to a person. In Joshua 23, we read one such speech from Joshua, the great leader of God’s people.

Joshua’s first task is to remind the people of all that God has done for them. He wants them to remember how God fought for them as they entered the land. Every other command Joshua gives begins with this important reminder: God has fought for them and given them victory and a promised inheritance.

As Joshua continues his speech, his main concern is something we have heard many times before, but clearly something that is on his heart. Joshua urges the people to keep the law and stay close to God’s word. The focus is on holding firmly to this word—never straying from it. At the end of his life, in his final speech to God’s people, Joshua emphasizes their obedience and commitment to God’s word. This is his greatest concern! Why? Because, as Joshua says, God’s word is what makes His people different from the surrounding nations. It protects them from sin and idolatry. Joshua tells them to keep God’s word “so that you may not mix with the nations remaining among you.” Their faithfulness to God’s word will keep them from becoming entangled in sin (23:7).

Joshua’s words come with a serious warning. If they fail to keep God’s word—and if they mix with the idolatrous nations around them—God’s punishment will come upon them. The very nations that led them astray will bring trouble and suffering. There is only one way forward for God’s people: to walk according to the word of the one true God, without turning to the left or right.

> [!important]+ Reflect and Respond
Joshua’s command is just as relevant for us today as it was for Israel. God has saved us through Christ. He has done the miraculous work of salvation for us. Our response is to build our lives every day on His perfect word. Pray today, asking God to give you strength to follow Him closely—walking straight according to His word, without turning aside at all.
