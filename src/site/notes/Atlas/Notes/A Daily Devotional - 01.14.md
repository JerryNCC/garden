### <center>神的子民的记号</center>

> [!info]- 🎙️Audio: [A Daily Devotional - 01.14 - CN]()

事情发生的顺序并不总是很重要。例如，你妈妈可能会让你打扫房间、倒垃圾、洗碗。你做的顺序重要吗？其实不太重要，只要最后都做完就行。但有些事情，顺序却非常关键。

在《创世记》17章中，我们读到了割礼之约。神赐给亚伯兰这个记号，并要求他遵行。这里的事件顺序非常重要。亚伯兰已经信靠神，因着他的信，神已将他算为义。既然神已经接纳了亚伯兰，割礼就不是亚伯兰必须履行的条件，因它是在神已经接纳他之后才施行的。割礼是一个记号——是神赐给祂的子民的记号，表示神是他们的神。这不是神成为他们的神的前提条件，但它依然是一个极为重要的记号，它使亚伯兰的家族与周围那些拜偶像的民族区分开来，表明他们是属于神的。在新约中，我们知道，这个割礼之约的记号与今天基督徒所行的洗礼相对应。

随着故事的发展，我们再次看到亚伯兰在完全相信神方面仍有挣扎。在《创世记》16章中，亚伯兰曾试图通过自己的方式来实现神的应许——与妻子撒莱的使女生下了以实玛利。在《创世记》17章中，似乎亚伯兰依然认为以实玛利可能是神所拣选的那位。然而，神有更伟大、更神奇的计划。神对他说：“撒莱你的妻子必给你生一个儿子，你要给他起名叫以撒；我要和他坚定我的约，作永远的约”（17:19）。神提醒亚伯兰，祂必定会信守向他和他后裔所作的应许。

> [!important]+ 反思与回应
在圣经中，神要求我们做许多事，不是吗？神也曾给亚伯兰许多指示。但请记住，神是在呼召他、使他成为自己的子民并因信称他为义之后才给他这些命令。我们也是如此！今天感谢神，因为“我们还做罪人的时候，基督为我们死”（罗马书5:8）。今天祈祷，求神帮助你全心全意地顺服祂——不是为了争取神的接纳，而是因为祂已经通过耶稣接纳了你！

### <center>A Sign for God’s People</center>

> [!question]+ Review
>1. What question did Abram ask God in Genesis 15:2–3? Why did he have this question?
 >2. What does the statement in Genesis 15:6, "Abram believed the Lord, and he credited it to him as righteousness," mean? Why did God count Abram's faith as righteousness?
>3. What special ceremony did God use to reaffirm His promise to Abram? What is the significance of this ceremony? Why did God pass through the split animals instead of Abram?

📖 **Passage to read**: ==Genesis 17==

> [!info]- 🎙️Audio: [A Daily Devotional - 01.14 - EN]()

The order in which things happen isn’t always important. For example, your mom might ask you to clean your room, take out the trash, and wash the dishes. Does it matter what you do first? Not really, as long as you get everything done. But sometimes, the order in which things happen really matters.

In Genesis 17, we read about the covenant of circumcision. It’s a sign that God gives to Abram and asks him to keep. The order of events here is very important. Abram has already believed God, and because of that, God has counted him as righteous. Since God has already accepted Abram, circumcision cannot be something Abram must do in order to be accepted by God. It comes after Abram is already accepted. Circumcision is a sign—a sign for God’s people to show that God is their God. It’s not a requirement for God to become their God. But even though it’s not a condition, it is still a very important sign. It sets apart Abram’s family from the other people around them who worshiped idols and shows that they belong to God. In the New Testament, we learn that this sign of the covenant is now like another sign we practice today: baptism.

As the chapter goes on, we see that Abram still struggles to fully trust God. Back in chapter 16, Abram tried to make God’s promise come true by his own efforts, having a son with his wife’s servant. In Genesis 17, it seems that Abram still thinks Ishmael might be the one God will use. But God has something else in mind—something miraculous. God tells him, “Sarah your wife shall bear you a son, and you shall call his name Isaac. I will establish my covenant with him as an everlasting covenant” (17:19). God is reminding Abram that He will keep His promises to him and his descendants.

> [!important]+ Reflect and Respond
God asks us to do many things in the Bible, doesn’t He? He gave Abram many instructions, too. But remember this—God gave these commands to Abram after He had called him, made him His own, and declared him righteous through faith. It’s the same for us! Thank God today that “while we were still sinners, Christ died for us” (Rom. 5:8). Pray that God will help you obey Him with all your heart—not to earn His acceptance, but because He has already accepted you through Jesus!
