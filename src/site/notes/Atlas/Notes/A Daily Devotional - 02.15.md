### <center>被分别出来</center>

> [!info]- 🎙️Audio: [A Daily Devotional - 02.15 - CN]()

当我们阅读《利未记》时，我们常常关注其中所教导的关于神的圣洁和人类的罪性。这种理解方式具有垂直的视角——思考神的完美与我们之间的差距。例如，书中整个献祭制度突显了借着洁净的血来处理罪恶的必要性。然而，在这一段经文中，我们也看到，被神分别出来不仅仅关乎献祭，更关乎日常生活的方式——一种水平的视角。

这一章的核心可以通过神在第二节中的一句话总结：“你们要圣洁，因为我是耶和华你们的神，是圣洁的。”这意味着神的子民必须在所有与人相处的关系中，活出与神圣洁相称的不同。首先，神呼召祂的子民通过如何待人来彰显他们的圣洁。例如，祂命令他们在田地里留下部分庄稼，让贫困的人可以来拾取。神还警告他们不要压迫、欺骗、仇恨或对他人不公。祂的呼召是明确的——我们与周围人的关系应当体现公义：公平、正直、善良和敬虔。

其次，神的圣洁在祂的子民身上应当在行为上体现出来，区分他们与周围的民族。像卖淫、通奸和吃带血的肉等行为都被禁止。神还禁止某些个人习惯，如纹身、占卜，甚至特定的发型。在这一切方面，神呼召祂的子民过一种不同的生活，让祂的圣洁影响到生活的各个层面。

如今，我们可能不会将这一章的每一个细节都直接应用到我们的生活中。然而，这些原则依然适用于我们。因为神是圣洁的，祂呼召祂的子民在回应祂的救恩时，活出圣洁和分别为圣的生活。这应该影响我们待人处事的方式，而我们的生活也应当与那些不认识耶稣的人不同。

> [!important]+ 反思与回应
神呼召我们通过祂在我们里面的圣灵，过一种为祂而分别出来的生活。今天花些时间，反思自己与神的关系是否已足够影响你与他人之间的关系。思考神如何呼召你过一种更加分别为圣、从世界中分别出来的生活，来荣耀祂。

### <center>Set Apart</center>

> [!question]+ Review
> 1. Why did Nadab and Abihu die in Leviticus 10:1-3? How does this event set the background for the establishment of the Day of Atonement?
> 2. How does the Day of Atonement ceremony begin with the priest's sins and gradually extend to the sins of the people? What is the symbolic meaning of sending the scapegoat into the wilderness?
> 3. The article states, “The process of atonement is not only difficult, but ultimately impossible by human effort alone.” Why can humans not complete atonement by their own efforts? How does Jesus become the perfect sacrifice to complete the work of atonement?

📖 **Passage to read**: ==Leviticus 19==

> [!info]- 🎙️Audio: [A Daily Devotional - 02.15 - EN]()  

When we read the book of Leviticus, we often focus on what it teaches us about God’s holiness and human sinfulness. This gives us a vertical focus—thinking about how God is perfect and how we fall short. For instance, the sacrificial system throughout the book highlights the essential need for cleansing blood to deal with sin. But in this passage, we also see that being set apart for God’s people involves not only sacrifice but also how they live day by day—a horizontal focus.

The heart of this chapter is summed up in a key phrase from God in verse 2: “You shall be holy, for I the LORD your God am holy.” This means that God’s people must live differently, reflecting His holiness in all their relationships. First, God calls His people to show their holiness through how they treat each other. For example, He commands them to leave some of their crops behind in the fields so the poor can come and gather food. God also warns them against oppressing, deceiving, hating, or being unjust to others. His call is clear—our relationships with those around us should be characterized by justice: fair, righteous, good, and godly behavior.

Second, God’s holiness in His people is meant to be visible in their behavior, setting them apart from the surrounding nations. Practices like prostitution, adultery, and eating meat with blood are forbidden. God also forbids certain personal habits like tattoos, fortune-telling, or specific haircuts. In all these ways, God is calling His people to live differently, letting His holiness affect every area of their lives.

Now, we may not apply every single detail of this chapter directly to our lives today. However, the principles are still relevant. Because God is holy, He calls His people to live holy and set-apart lives in response to His salvation. This should affect how we treat others, and our lives should look different from those who do not know Jesus.

> [!important]+ Reflect and Respond
God calls us to be set apart for Him by the power of His Holy Spirit within us. Take some time today to reflect on the ways your relationship with God might not be influencing your relationships with others as much as it should. Think about how God might be calling you to live more set apart from the world for Him.
