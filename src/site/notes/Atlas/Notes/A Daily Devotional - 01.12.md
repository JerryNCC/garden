### <center>亚伯兰之间的君王</center>

> [!info]- 🎙️Audio: [A Daily Devotional - 01.04 - CN]()

当我们阅读这样的经文时，应该记住，这不仅仅是圣经的故事，它也是我们故事的一部分。圣经中的一切都与耶稣相关，而因为耶稣是我们的救主和主，这一切也与我们息息相关。亚伯兰和罗得的故事是神更宏大计划的一部分，而通过信心，我们成为了这故事的一部分。

在这个阶段，亚伯兰已经顺从神的呼召，离开了他的故乡，并带上了他的侄子罗得。然而，后来两人决定分开。罗得选择了一个地区安顿下来，但那里很快爆发了一场大规模的冲突——几个君王之间的战争（实际上更像是部落首领之间的争斗）。在这场战斗中，罗得和他的家人被俘虏了。当亚伯兰听到消息时，他毫不犹豫地行动起来，召集了他的队伍，总共超过三百人，追击并击败了基大老玛王和他的盟友。

胜利之后，所多玛王前来见亚伯兰，并提出了一个提议。他告诉亚伯兰可以保留所有从战斗中收复的财物，只需将他的人民归还给他。但亚伯兰拒绝了。他不想从所多玛王那里接受任何东西，可能是因为他不想欠这样一个邪恶之人的人情。

在这些事件中，还出现了另一个神秘人物——麦基洗德，也就是撒冷王。他在亚伯兰战后归来时迎接了他，带来了食物和饮料，并在第19-20节中为亚伯兰祝福。更令人惊讶的是，亚伯兰将自己所得的十分之一献给了麦基洗德。

关于麦基洗德，有几点值得注意。首先，他是一位王——撒冷的王。其次，他是至高神的祭司。在那个古老的世界中，有这样一个人，既是他人民的王，又是他们的祭司，作为人民与独一真神之间的中保。这使他成为一个独特而重要的角色。事实上，麦基洗德预示了一个更伟大的王与祭司——耶稣基督的到来。

> [!important]+ 反思与回应
你是否曾感到旧约的经文令人迷茫？今天花些时间向神祷告，求他帮助你看到这些经文如何与今天的生活息息相关。圣经是神子民的故事，而通过耶稣基督，你也成为了这故事的一部分。他是你的王和祭司，在每一步都引领并为你代求。

📖 **Passage to read**: ==Genesis 14==

> [!info]- 🎙️Audio: [A Daily Devotional - 01.12 - EN]()


When we read a passage like this, we need to remember that it’s not just a story from the Bible—it’s also part of our story. Everything in the Bible connects to Jesus, and because we belong to him as our Savior and Lord, it connects to us. Abram and Lot’s story is part of God’s larger story, one that we’ve been brought into through faith.

At this point in Abram’s journey, he has obeyed God’s call, leaving his homeland and bringing his nephew Lot with him. But the time comes when the two of them decide to part ways. Lot settles in a region where a great conflict breaks out—a battle among several kings, or perhaps tribal leaders. During this conflict, Lot and his family are captured. When Abram hears about it, he doesn’t hesitate. He gathers his men, over three hundred of them, and sets out to rescue Lot. They pursue and defeat King Chedorlaomer and his allies.

After the victory, the king of Sodom approaches Abram with an offer. He tells Abram to keep all the possessions recovered in the battle, asking only for the return of his people. But Abram refuses. He doesn’t want to take anything from the king of Sodom, likely because he doesn’t want to owe anything to a man who seems to be wicked and ungodly.

In the midst of these events, another figure appears—Melchizedek, the king of Salem. He meets Abram after the battle, bringing out food and drink, and he blesses Abram in verses 19–20. What happens next is remarkable: Abram gives Melchizedek a tenth of everything he has.

There are a few key things to notice about Melchizedek. First, he is both a king and a priest. He rules over his people and also serves as a mediator between them and the one true God. This makes him a unique and significant figure in the story. In fact, Melchizedek points forward to someone even greater—Jesus, the ultimate King and Priest.

> [!important]+ Reflect and Respond
Do you ever feel overwhelmed by the Old Testament? Take a moment to ask God to help you see how it’s all connected to your life today. The Bible is the story of God’s people, and through Jesus, you are part of that story. He is your King and Priest, leading and interceding for you every step of the way.
