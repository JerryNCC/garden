### <center>耶稣与法利赛人</center>

> [!info]- 🎙️Audio: [None]()

在福音书中，法利赛人常常与耶稣形成鲜明的对比。约翰福音第八章记载了耶稣与他们的一段长谈，约翰要我们从中学习一些重要的功课。

首先，有些人根本看不见耶稣真正的身份。他们对祂是谁完全盲目。第22节和第27节正是明显的例子：一会儿，他们以为耶稣是在说要自尽；另一会儿，他们又无法理解祂是在讲天父——这一点对我们读者来说却显而易见。约翰的意思很清楚：明白耶稣不是自然而然的事。对某些人而言，祂的话语落在瞎眼与耳聋的心上。

其次，约翰指出，所有一切最终归结到一个核心问题：耶稣是谁？法利赛人拒绝接受祂的宣称，但耶稣毫不退让。祂公开宣告自己就是神，甚至使用旧约中耶和华的名号“我是”。犹太人听了极其愤怒，立刻拿起石头要打死祂。但这正是当时、也是今日的分水岭：耶稣真的是神吗？若祂是神，那么救恩唯独在祂里面。这并不是单单因为是亚伯拉罕的后裔，也不是单靠守律法。整个救恩的中心，就是祂——这位为人、却又是真神的主。最后，全人类都会被分成两类：一类承认耶稣是主，另一类坚决拒绝，甚至以石头或生命来抗拒真理。

最后，约翰提醒我们：信心本身就是神的恩赐。第30节带来安慰与盼望：“就有许多人信祂。”这绝不是小事——这是神迹。瞎眼得开，刚硬的心被柔软——这一切都是神奇妙的恩典作为。

> [!important]+ 反思与回应
因此，我们的结论不是绝望，而是感恩。若你今天相信耶稣，那是因为神已向你施恩，祂向你显明耶稣的真实身份。让我们今日向神献上感谢，因为祂赐下恩典，使我们能看见并承认耶稣为主。

### <center>Jesus and the Pharisees</center>

> [!question]+ Review
> 1. In Jesus’ conversation with Nicodemus, what does “being born again” mean, and why did Nicodemus fail to understand it at first?
> 2. How do the visions in Ezekiel 36 and 37 foreshadow the new life that Jesus gives?
> 3. When Jesus referred to the event of “Moses lifting up the serpent in the wilderness” (Numbers 21), how did this point to his own redemptive work of being “lifted up”?

📖 **Passage to read**: ==John 08:12-59==

> [!info]- 🎙️Audio: [None]()  

In the Gospels, the Pharisees often appear as the contrast to Jesus. In John 8, we hear a long dialogue between them and Jesus, and John wants us to see what this exchange teaches.

First, some people simply cannot see who Jesus is. They are blind to his true identity. In verses 22 and 27, we watch how far off their thinking is. At one point, they assume Jesus is speaking of taking his own life. At another, they fail to realize he is speaking about God the Father—something that seems so clear to us as readers. John’s point is plain: understanding Jesus is not automatic. For some, his words fall on deaf ears and blind eyes.

Second, John shows us that everything finally turns on one question: Who is Jesus? The Pharisees would not accept what he claimed, but Jesus did not hold back. He declared that he is God, even using the Old Testament name of Yahweh, “I am.” The Jews saw this as blasphemy, and they picked up stones to kill him. But this is the dividing line, both then and now. Is Jesus truly God? If he is, then salvation is found only in him. It is not about belonging to Abraham’s family line. It is not about keeping the law by itself. Everything centers on him—the man who is God. At the end, all humanity will be divided into two groups: those who confess that Jesus is Lord and those who reject him, even to the point of violence.

Third, John reminds us that faith itself is a gift of God. Verse 30 gives us this encouragement: “Many believed in him.” That is no small thing—it is a miracle. Blind eyes opened, hard hearts softened—this is the work of God’s grace.

> [!important]+ Reflect and Respond
So we end here, not in despair but in gratitude. If you believe in Jesus, it is because God has been kind to you. He has shown you who Jesus really is. Give thanks today that he has given you the grace to see and confess Jesus as Lord.
