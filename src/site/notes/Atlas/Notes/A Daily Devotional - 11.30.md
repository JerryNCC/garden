### <center>逆流而行的和好</center>

> [!info]- 🎙️Audio: [None]()


腓利门书是保罗写给一位名叫腓利门的人的短信。腓利门似乎是一位富有的人，他有一个奴隶名叫俄尼西母。俄尼西母曾逃离腓利门，并很可能在逃跑时偷了他的东西。但在逃亡途中，俄尼西母遇见了保罗，他悔改自己的罪，并信靠耶稣基督。在保罗被囚罗马期间，俄尼西母成为了保罗亲密的朋友。

这让局势变得微妙。俄尼西母曾深深伤害过他的主人，但现在他成了基督徒，与曾经的主人共享同样的信仰。保罗在其中提供了智慧的劝告。他告诉俄尼西母，需要与腓利门修复关系。同时，保罗也向腓利门提出劝告。与神的和好，应当延伸到与神子民的和好。这正是保罗通过俄尼西母带回信中传达的核心信息。

保罗并未命令腓利门必须原谅俄尼西母，但他基于福音热切地劝他这么做。他请求腓利门接纳俄尼西母“不再是奴仆，乃是比奴仆更亲爱的弟兄……在肉身上，也在主里”（16节）。保罗甚至承诺承担俄尼西母所欠的任何债务，并鼓励腓利门将他视为平等之人。保罗的劝告温和而坚定。

为什么保罗如此强调？这样的行为在当时是逆流而行的。逃奴按当时法律可以受到惩罚，甚至丧命。但保罗表明，福音的人行事不同。俄尼西母因基督与神和好，也应与腓利门和好。腓利门应向这位在基督里的弟兄施恩，就如基督向他施恩一样。他们的关系因此永远改变——他们在基督里成为弟兄，同为同一救主所救。

> [!important]+ 反思与回应
你是否心中怀恨，有人对你怀恨未解？如果你因悔改与信靠基督而与神和好，你也应与基督里的弟兄姐妹和好。祈求神今天赐你勇气，迈出第一步，向人认罪、彼此饶恕、追求和好。

### <center>Countercultural Reconciliation  </center>

> [!question]+ Review

📖 **Passage to read**: ==Philemon==

> [!info]- 🎙️Audio: [None]()  


Philemon is a short letter from Paul to a man named Philemon. Philemon appears to have been a wealthy man who owned a slave named Onesimus. Onesimus had run away from Philemon and may have stolen from him in the process. But in the midst of his flight, Onesimus met Paul. He repented of his sin, put his faith in Jesus Christ, and became a dear friend to Paul while Paul was imprisoned in Rome.

This created an interesting situation. Onesimus had wronged his earthly master, yet now he was a Christian, sharing faith in Christ with his former owner. Paul steps into this situation with wise counsel. He tells Onesimus that he needs to make things right with Philemon. But Paul also appeals to Philemon. Reconciliation with God should flow into reconciliation with God’s people. That is the heart of Paul’s message in the letter that Onesimus carries to his master.

Paul does not command Philemon to forgive Onesimus, but he strongly urges him to do so on the basis of the gospel. He asks Philemon to receive Onesimus “no longer as a slave, but better than a slave, as a beloved brother … both in the flesh and in the Lord” (v.16). Paul promises to cover any debt Onesimus owes and encourages Philemon to take him in as an equal. Paul is gentle but firm in his appeal.

Why does Paul press this point? Such a response would have been countercultural. Runaway slaves could be legally punished, even killed. But Paul shows that people of the gospel act differently. Onesimus’s reconciliation with God through Christ calls for forgiveness and restoration with Philemon. Philemon is to show grace to his brother in Christ, just as Christ has shown grace to him. Their relationship is changed forever; they are brothers in Christ, saved by the same Savior.

> [!important]+ Reflect and Respond
Do you hold anger toward someone, or does someone hold something against you? If you are reconciled to God through repentance and faith in Christ, you are called to be reconciled with your brothers and sisters in Christ. Ask God today to give you courage to take the first step toward confession, forgiveness, and reconciliation.
