### <center>迷惑人的人与真正的信徒</center>

> [!info]- 🎙️Audio: [None]()

你大概已经注意到，新约圣经中——尤其是在书信里——经常提到一些被称为“迷惑人的人”（第 7 节）。保罗为这样的人深感忧虑，使徒约翰也是如此。然而，在今天的教会处境中，我们并不总是清楚这些“迷惑人的人”究竟长什么样。他们今天可能以什么面目出现？更重要的是，当我们跟随耶稣基督时，我们如何知道自己没有被迷惑呢？

约翰对这些问题的回答，与其说是聚焦在迷惑人的人身上，不如说是聚焦在我们如何活出基督徒的生命。虽然他确实提到那些“已经到世上去的”迷惑者，但他并没有花时间去点名他们，或教导我们如何揭穿他们（第 7 节）。相反，约翰只专注一件事：作为耶稣的跟随者，我们的生命应当呈现出怎样的样式。约翰要表达的是：真实的基督徒生命，正是抵挡迷惑的关键。那么，他到底要我们做什么呢？

其实，这是一个我们非常熟悉的信息——在《约翰一书》中也同样出现过。第一，我们在一同跟随耶稣的道路上，要持续彼此相爱。真正的基督徒彼此相爱；这是“从起初”就赐给我们的同一条命令（第 6 节）。当耶稣的跟随者以基督那样舍己的爱彼此相爱时，福音就在他们的生命中结出正确的果子。  
第二，我们要相信耶稣基督确实以人的身份来到世上。第一个命令关乎我们的爱——关乎我们与其他信徒的关系；而这个命令则关乎我们的信仰内容。看来，迷惑人的人往往会质疑耶稣道成肉身的真实性——否认他真的来到世上，否认他既完全是神、又完全是人。真正的信徒则会持续地、坚定地承认这一奇妙而奥秘的事实。之所以如此重要，是因为这正是我们理解救恩的核心！

> [!important]+ 反思与回应 
那么，**你如何知道自己今天是否正在被迷惑呢？**其中一个方式，是检视你与其他耶稣跟随者之间的关系：你是否真心爱其他基督徒，并愿意为服事他们付出代价？另一个方式，是检视你对耶稣的信仰，以及你如何向他人述说他：你是否安息在他里面，承认他是救主——那位完全的神、完全的人，唯有他才能使人得与神和好？  
今天就把这些事带到神面前，与他交谈，求他保守你不被迷惑。

### <center>Deceivers and True Believers</center>

> [!question]+ Review
> 

📖 **Passage to read**: ==2 John==

> [!info]- 🎙️Audio: [None]()  

You’ve probably noticed that there is a lot in the New Testament—and especially in the Epistles—about people who are labeled “deceivers” (v. 7). Paul is worried about these kinds of people; the apostle John is as well. But we don’t always know what deceivers look like in today’s church context. What does a deceiver look like today? More importantly, how do we know that we are not being deceived as we follow Jesus Christ?

John’s answer to these questions will have very little to do with the deceivers themselves and much more to do with how we live out our faith as Christians. While he does mention these deceivers, who “have gone out into the world,” he doesn’t spend any time identifying them or giving us key ways to expose them (v. 7). John focuses only on what our lives should look like as followers of Jesus. The genuine Christian life, John is saying, is the key to resisting these deceivers. What does he tell us to do?

Well, it is a very familiar message—one found also in 1 John. First, we continue to love one another as we follow Jesus together. True Christians love one another—it’s the same commandment that has been given to us “from the beginning” (v. 6). As followers of Jesus truly love one another with the sacrificial love of Jesus, the gospel is bearing fruit in their lives in the right way! Second, we believe that Jesus Christ came to this earth as a human being. The first command had to do with our love—our lives with other believers. This command has to do with our belief. Deceivers, it seems, will question the reality of the incarnation of Jesus Christ—that he really came to earth as a human being and was fully God and fully human. True believers will commit themselves to continually affirming this wonderful—and mysterious—reality. It is so important because this is the core of our understanding of salvation!

> [!important]+ Reflect and Respond
_How do you know if you are being deceived today? One way will be to look at your relationships with other followers of Jesus. Are you loving other Christians and making sacrifices to serve them? Another way will be to look at what you believe about Jesus and tell to other people about him. Are you resting in him as the Savior—fully God and fully man—who alone is the only way to peace with God? Talk to God about these things today. Ask him to protect you from being deceived!_
