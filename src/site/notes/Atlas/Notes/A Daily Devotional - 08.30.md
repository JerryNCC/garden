### <center>我要因耶和华欢欣</center>

> [!info]- 🎙️Audio: [None]()

你是否曾因上帝的作为而困惑？你是否曾疑问，祂为何要这样行？先知哈巴谷也曾有过这样的挣扎。他甚至将自己的疑问与埋怨直接带到上帝面前。

起初，哈巴谷为上帝百姓的罪恶呼求。对他来说，这些悖逆似乎无人管束，而上帝却静默不语。他说：“你为何使我看见罪孽？你为何看着奸恶而不理呢？”（1:3）他感受到的，正是我们常常的心境——似乎上帝任由祂的子民背弃祂。可是，上帝回答祂的先知，审判确实要来临。祂要兴起迦勒底人（就是巴比伦人），这群残暴邪恶的民族，来施行管教。这样的答案更让哈巴谷困扰：圣洁的上帝怎么能借着比以色列更败坏的国度来审判祂的百姓呢？

到了第三章，我们看见哈巴谷挣扎的终点。上帝的计划没有改变，但哈巴谷的心改变了。他接受审判必会临到——至少在一段时间里。但他也相信，上帝最终仍要为祂子民的益处行事。他回想起上帝昔日大能的作为——当上帝出来拯救祂的百姓，击打恶人的头（3:13）。纵然想到巴比伦的入侵让他战兢，他仍然选择安静等候，相信上帝终必使万事归于正直。

《哈巴谷书》给我们看到一个人，外在的处境没有改变，但他的心已经不同了。他曾与上帝摔跤，最终却在信心中得安息。听他祷告的结尾：“虽然无花果树不发旺，葡萄树不结果……然而，我要因耶和华欢欣，因救我的上帝喜乐。”（3:17–18）他为何能这样说？因为他认识上帝。

> [!important]+ 反思与回应
请再读一遍哈巴谷书 3:17–19，并用祷告来回应。你今日能否亲口说出这些话？纵然在艰难中，你是否仍能因上帝而喜乐，因祂是你最大的满足？求上帝赐你力量，使你在一切事上以上帝为至宝，好在患难之日能站立得稳。

> [!question]+ Review
> 1.⁠ ⁠In Nahum 3, how does the prophet describe the sins of Nineveh? What kind of spiritual corruption do these sins reveal?
2.⁠ ⁠Why did Nineveh, after repenting in Jonah’s time, return to sin two generations later? What warning does this give us today?
3.⁠ ⁠The article reminds us that even when God uses enemies to discipline his people, he never abandons them. How can this truth give you comfort and strengthen your faith?

📖 **Passage to read**: ==Habakkuk 03==

> [!info]- 🎙️Audio: [None]()  

Have you ever found yourself struggling with God’s ways? Have you asked why he chooses to act as he does? The prophet Habakkuk knew this struggle. He even brought his complaints directly to God.

At first, Habakkuk cried out about the sins of God’s own people. It seemed to him that their rebellion went on without punishment, while God looked on in silence. “Why do you make me see iniquity,” Habakkuk said, “and why do you idly look at wrong?” (1:3). He felt what we often feel—that God was standing by as his people rejected him. But God told Habakkuk that judgment was indeed coming. He would raise up the Chaldeans (the Babylonians), a violent and wicked people, to bring it. This only troubled Habakkuk more. How could a holy God use a nation even more corrupt than Israel to judge his people?

Chapter 3 brings us to the end of Habakkuk’s struggle. God’s plan has not changed, but Habakkuk has. He now accepts that judgment will come for a time. But he also believes that God will finally work for the good of his people. He remembers God’s mighty works in the past—when God came out to save his people and struck down their enemies (3:13). Though the coming invasion of Babylon makes him tremble, Habakkuk chooses to wait quietly and trust that God will set things right in the end.

The book of Habakkuk gives us a picture of a man whose situation is the same, but whose heart is different. He has wrestled with God, and in the end he rests in faith. Listen to the words that close his prayer: “Though the fig tree should not blossom, nor fruit be on the vines … yet … I will take joy in the God of my salvation” (3:17–18). How could he speak this way? Because he knew God.

> [!important]+ Reflect and Respond
Read Habakkuk 3:17–19 again as you pray. Can you say those words yourself? Can you rejoice in God even when life is hard, trusting him as your greatest joy? Ask God to help you treasure him above all else, so that you may stand firm in the day of trouble.
