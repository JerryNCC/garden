### <center>为罪哀痛</center>

> [!info]- 🎙️Audio: [None]()


哥林多教会所面对的罪不止一种，但其中有一件极其可憎的事，使保罗不得不严厉指出。他听说：“有人收了他的继母为妻。”（哥林多前书5:1）这罪本身已经够令人震惊了，但更令保罗痛心的是教会的态度——他们竟然不以为耻，反而自高自傲。保罗写道：“你们还自高自大！”（5:2）他们非但不为这罪忧伤，反而似乎以自己的“包容”与“开放”自夸，仿佛这是属灵成熟或思想进步的表现。可是在保罗看来，这根本不是自由，而是堕落；不是恩典的彰显，而是罪的容忍。这样的罪，在基督的教会中绝无立足之地。

那教会本该如何回应呢？保罗说得明白——他们**应当哀痛**。面对罪，尤其是那公开而顽梗、不肯悔改的罪，信徒的反应不应是骄傲，而应是忧伤。罪应使我们痛心，而非自夸。

然而，保罗并不止于此。他进一步写道：“但如今我写信给你们说，若有称为弟兄的，是行淫乱的，或贪婪的，或拜偶像的，或辱骂的，或醉酒的，或勒索的；这样的人不可与他相交，就是与他吃饭都不可。”（5:11）

这节经文确实不易理解，我们必须谨慎地诠释。保罗并不是要我们远离那些与罪挣扎、却真心寻求饶恕与帮助的信徒；他也不是要我们隔绝那些尚未信主、仍活在罪中的人——若我们这样行，又怎能将福音传给他们呢？保罗所指的，是那些**自称**信主，却持续在公然的罪中行走、毫无悔改之意的人。面对这样的人，教会必须划清界限。当一个人顽梗不悔时，最有爱的行动，或许正是勇敢地说出：“够了！”因为有时，上帝正是借着这样的责备与纪律，唤醒他回转，重新归向基督。

> [!important]+ 反思与回应
保罗呼召我们要**为罪哀痛**。你是否如此？当你看见罪——无论是在教会中，还是在你自己的心里——你会感到忧伤吗？求神赐给我们柔软的心，不再对罪麻木，而是因罪忧伤，并在忧伤中仰望那位为我们钉十字架、使我们脱离罪权的救主耶稣基督。唯有祂，能使哀哭变为喜乐，使罪人得享真正的自由。

### <center>Mourning Over Sin</center>

> [!question]+ Review
> 


📖 **Passage to read**: ==1 Corinthians 05==

> [!info]- 🎙️Audio: [None]()  


The church in Corinth was dealing with more than one kind of sin. But one particular case was so shocking that Paul had to address it directly. He had heard that “a man has his father’s wife” (1 Corinthians 5:1). That was terrible enough—but what shocked Paul even more was the church’s attitude toward it. “And you are arrogant,” he wrote (5:2). Instead of being brokenhearted over the sin, the Corinthians seemed proud of their tolerance. Maybe they thought this showed how “open-minded” and “accepting” they were. But Paul would have none of it. This was not a sign of maturity or freedom—it was sin, plain and simple—and such behavior had no place among the followers of Jesus Christ.

So how should they have responded? Paul says clearly: they should have **mourned**. The proper response to sin in the church is not pride, but grief. Sin—especially public, unrepentant sin—should break the hearts of believers. But Paul doesn’t stop there. He goes on to write, “I am writing to you not to associate with anyone who bears the name of brother if he is guilty of sexual immorality or greed, or is an idolater, reviler, drunkard, or swindler—not even to eat with such a one” (5:11).

This is a difficult verse, and it needs to be read carefully. Paul is not talking about believers who struggle with sin and are seeking forgiveness. Nor is he saying we should avoid unbelievers who live sinful lives—of course not! How else could they ever hear the gospel? What Paul is describing is someone who **claims** to be a Christian but keeps on living in open rebellion against God, refusing to repent. In that situation, the church must draw a clear line. There comes a point when the most loving thing we can do is to say, “This cannot continue.” Sometimes, that hard confrontation is what God will use to bring a person to repentance and back to Christ.

> [!important]+ Reflect and Respond
Paul calls us to **mourn** over sin. Do you? Do you grieve when you see sin in your church, or in your own heart? Pray that God will give you a sensitive heart—a heart that truly feels sorrow over sin, not indifference. And as you mourn, remember that your hope is not in your grief but in Jesus Christ, who died and rose again to set you free from sin’s power.
