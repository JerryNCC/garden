你曾经被言语伤害过。在你生命中的某个时刻，总有人说过一些话，那些话刺痛你的方式，与身体上的疼痛完全不同。朋友，你知道言语的力量。你知道它们如何伤人——特别是当这些话是被你所爱的人随意、残忍地抛出来的时候。你也知道，你也会用自己的话伤害别人——或许你已经从中学到了痛苦的教训！雅各也知道这一点。他想让我们知道：我们与基督的关系必须影响我们说话的方式。

人类的舌头既危险又有力量。这是雅各在这段经文中首先指出的。舌头就像一根小小的嚼环，却能控制巨大而有力的马；像一块小小的舵，却能在海上操控庞大的船只；又像一簇小小的火苗，却能点燃整片森林。纵观历史，罪恶的人类言语造成过巨大的伤害。正因如此，雅各说，能控制自己的舌头几乎证明了一个人能在生命的每个方面拥有自制力。你今天能控制你的舌头吗？你是否衡量你说的每一句话，并用所有的言语来荣耀耶稣、鼓励他人？

如果“你的言语”是你生命中难以掌控的领域，雅各还有另一句提醒给你：“颂赞和咒诅从一个口里出来，我的弟兄们，这是不应该的”（3:10）。正如清泉不能流出又咸又淡的水，同样，一个被耶稣引导的人不能既发出赞美耶稣的话，又吐出污秽、刻薄或不真实的话。我们的言语必须与救主的呼召一致。自称跟随耶稣，却同时接受咒骂、八卦或污秽话语的习惯，这是不对的。这根本不相称！

> [!important]+ 反思与回应
今天特别为你的言语祷告。想一想你这几天说过的话。你的舌头是否被你的救主耶稣掌管？还是你的言语已经失控——足以用愤怒的言语、闲话或污秽言语引爆整个森林？来到你的救主面前祷告，求他让你的生命在每一个层面上与他的圣洁性情一致。把你的言语交给他，求他掌管你的口，让你的言语为他的荣耀而发出！

### <center>More Dangerous Than Sticks and Stones</center>

📖 **Passage to read**: ==James 3:01-12==

> [!info]- 🎙️Audio: [None]()  

You have been hurt by words. At some point in your life, someone has said something that stung you with a pain that is altogether different from physical discomfort. Friend, you know the power of words. You know how they can hurt—especially when they are flung carelessly and cruelly by someone you love. You also know that you can hurt other people with your words as well—and perhaps you have learned this the hard way! James knows this too. And he wants us to know that our relationship with Christ must impact the way we speak.

The human tongue is dangerous and powerful. That’s the first thing James points out in this passage. The tongue is like a small bridle, which controls a huge and powerful horse. It’s like a rudder, which can steer a massive ship in the ocean. It’s like a small fire, which can set a huge forest ablaze. Much damage has been done throughout history with sinful human words. Because of this, James says that getting control of one’s tongue essentially proves that one can have self-control in every area. Do you have control of your tongue today? Do you measure every word and use all your speech to glorify Jesus and encourage other people?

If your speech is an area of your life over which you have little control, James has another word for you today: “From the same mouth come blessing and cursing. My brothers, these things ought not to be so” (3:10). Just as fresh springs can’t shoot out both salty and clean water, so a person led by Jesus should not spout out both praises to Jesus and words that are dirty, unkind, or untrue. Our speech must line up with the call of our Savior. It’s not right to claim to follow Jesus and accept a habit of cursing, gossip, or filthy talk. It just doesn’t fit!

> [!important]+ Reflect and Respond
_Pray specifically about your words today. Think about the things you’ve said, even in the past few days. Is your tongue held captive to Jesus, your Savior? Or is your speech out of control—capable of lighting up a forest with angry words, gossip, or dirty talk? Pray to your Savior and ask him to let your life line up with his holy character at every level. Give him your speech today, and ask him to take it over for his glory!_
