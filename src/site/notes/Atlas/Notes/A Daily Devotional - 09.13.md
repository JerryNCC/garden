从耶稣进入耶路撒冷的那一刻起，一切都稳步走向十字架。临近最后的时刻，他坦然对门徒说出将要发生的事。他告诉他们，他必被钉十字架；他解释那瓶倒在他身上的香膏，是为他的安葬所作的预备；他甚至警告他们，其中一人要出卖他。耶稣已把一切都说得明明白白，好让他们为即将到来的审判、死亡和复活做好准备。他们理当坚定地与他同在。

所以，当犹大最终背叛耶稣时，我们原以为其余的门徒会站出来。但我们知道，犹大已经为三十块银子出卖了灵魂，与祭司长暗中订下协议，要把耶稣交给他们。只是，当背叛真正临到时，其余的人总该守住忠心吧？

然而，令人震惊的事情发生了。失败的并不只是犹大。是的，他亲手把耶稣交给仇敌，但其他人也差不多。请再看第56节：当那群人上前捉拿耶稣时，耶稣向他们说话，马太却记载说：“门徒都离开他逃走了。”他们全都逃了。在那受苦的时辰，耶稣独自站立，被那些与他同行多年的门徒撇下。他独自走向死亡——一场为拯救那些逃离他的门徒而舍命的死亡。

朋友，这正是我们的写照。我们在罪中同样背离了耶稣。我们并不比那些门徒更坚强或更勇敢；若靠自己，我们也会做出同样的事。然而，耶稣独自走向十字架。他为像我们这样软弱的人承担罪罚，替那些无法、也不愿与他同站的人付上代价。

> [!important]+ 反思与回应
祷告吧，求神赐你勇气，每一天为那位独自走上十字架的王而活。求他帮助你，在言语、思想和行动上都能刚强，为那位成就我们无法成就之事的主作见证。

> [!question]+ Review
> 1.⁠ ⁠How did the crowd welcome Jesus when He entered Jerusalem, and what did their actions symbolize?
2.⁠ ⁠What did Jesus see in the temple, and what did He do in response?
3.⁠ ⁠Why did the true King enter Jerusalem, and how was His mission different from what people expected?

📖 **Passage to read**: ==Matthew 26:01-56==

> [!info]- 🎙️Audio: [None]()  


From the moment Jesus entered Jerusalem, everything moved steadily toward the cross. As the final hours drew closer, he spoke plainly to his disciples about what was coming. He told them that he would be crucified. He explained that the perfume poured on him was a sign of preparation for his burial. He even warned them that one of them would betray him. Jesus gave them every reason to be ready for the trial, the death, and the resurrection that lay ahead. They should have been prepared to stay with him.

So when Judas finally turned against Jesus, we might expect the other disciples to take their stand. Judas, we know, had already sold his soul for thirty pieces of silver, making a deal with the chief priests to hand Jesus over in secret. But surely the rest would stay true when the betrayal came.

Then comes the shock. Judas is not the only one who fails. Yes, he delivers Jesus to his enemies, but the others are not far behind. Look again at verse 56. As the crowd closes in, Jesus speaks to them, and then Matthew tells us, “Then all the disciples left him and fled.” They all run. When the hour of suffering arrives, Jesus stands alone, abandoned by the very men who had walked with him for years. He goes forward to death by himself—a death that will bring salvation even to those who ran away.

Friend, this is a picture of us. We, too, have turned from Jesus in our sin. We are not stronger or braver than those first disciples. Left to ourselves, we would have done the same. Yet Jesus went to the cross alone. He bore the penalty of sin for people like us, who could not and would not stand with him.

Pray that God will give you courage to live each day for the King who went to the cross—alone—for your sake. Ask him to help you speak, think, and act with boldness for the One who did what none of us could do.

> [!important]+ Reflect and Respond
Take time to pray to your King. Remember who Jesus is. Give thanks that he is the King who first laid down his life for his people, and who now reigns over them forever.
