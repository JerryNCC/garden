### <center>以言语与行动说预言</center>

何西阿的经历在诸先知中极为独特，因为他的生命与信息紧密相连。神不仅吩咐他传讲信息，更呼召他亲身活出来，即使这会带来深切的痛苦。那么，何西阿的生命与预言有何关联？神要他娶一位不忠的妻子，好使他的婚姻成为神与祂不忠百姓关系的鲜明写照。

一开始，神就赐下令人震惊的命令：“你去娶淫妇为妻，也收那从淫乱所生的儿女，因为这地大行淫乱，离弃耶和华”（1:2）。神毫不隐藏祂的目的，这婚姻正是要显明以色列的悖逆——他们拜偶像，骄傲，贪婪，陷在各样罪中。何西阿顺服神的声音，让自己的婚姻成为活生生的预言，展现神与祂百姓破裂的关系。连他的儿女名字，都是神亲自指定，作为对以色列罪的审判预兆，却也暗示了神对属祂子民的最终拯救。何西阿不仅仅是宣讲神话语的先知，他更是用痛苦的生命经历活出了这信息。

当何西阿开口时，他的信息并不陌生：神要因祂百姓的罪而施行审判。他把以色列的悖逆比作不忠的妻子。以色列说：“我要随从所爱的，因他们给我饼与水、羊毛与麻、油与酒”（2:5）。因此，神要把以色列交在她所追随的列国手中。他们羡慕外邦的偶像与罪恶，所以神就任凭他们完全被交付给那些列国。

> [!important]+ 反思与回应
这段经文令人心中沉重，却真实显明了神的真理。愿我们祷告，求神赐下对罪更深的憎恶。也求祂开启我们的眼睛，使我们看见在基督里得赎的荣美。更要感谢神，因着耶稣的宝血，我们得以归向祂，从骄傲、罪恶与迷失中被释放出来。

> 1.⁠ ⁠Why did King Darius promote Daniel to a high position?
2.⁠ ⁠What did Daniel do when faced with the king’s decree?
3.⁠ ⁠At the beginning and end of the chapter, what was Darius’s attitude toward worship directed to?

📖 **Passage to read**: ==Daniel 02==

> [!info]- 🎙️Audio: [None]()  

Hosea’s story stands out among the prophets because his own life is tied so closely to his message. God does not just tell him what to say—He calls Hosea to live it out, even in a way that brings him deep personal pain. What connects Hosea’s life to his prophecy? God tells him to marry an unfaithful woman, so that his marriage becomes a living picture of God’s relationship with His unfaithful people.

Right at the start, God gives Hosea a shocking command: “Take to yourself a wife of whoredom and have children of whoredom, for the land commits great whoredom by forsaking the LORD” (1:2). God makes His purpose clear. This marriage is to be a mirror of Israel’s unfaithfulness—a reflection of their idolatry, pride, greed, and sin. Hosea obeys, allowing his marriage to become a living prophecy of God’s broken relationship with His people. Even the names of his children, chosen by God, point to the coming judgment against Israel’s sin, but also to the hope of salvation for those who truly belong to Him. Hosea, then, is not only a prophet who speaks God’s word, but one who painfully lives it.

When Hosea does speak, his message is familiar: God’s judgment on sin. He describes Israel’s rebellion as that of an unfaithful wife. Israel has turned to other “lovers,” saying, “I will go after my lovers, who give me my bread and my water, my wool and my flax, my oil and my drink” (2:5). Because of this, God will give Israel over to the very nations they chased after. They longed for the idols and sins of their neighbors, and so God will hand them over to those same neighbors.

> [!important]+ Reflect and Respond
This passage is hard to hear, but it points us to God’s truth. As you read, pray that God would give you a deeper hatred for your own sin. Ask Him to help you see more clearly the beauty of your redemption in Christ. And give thanks that by the blood of Jesus, God has brought you back to Himself, setting you free from pride, sin, and wandering.
