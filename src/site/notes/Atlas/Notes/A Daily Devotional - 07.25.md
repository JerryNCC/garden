### <center>警戒之言</center>

> [!info]- 🎙️Audio: [A Daily Devotional - 07.25 - CN]()


今日我们听见“先知”一词，往往联想到预言未来的人。但在圣经中，先知的定义远不止于此。先知是上帝的代言人，是向祂的百姓传讲祂话语的人。许多时候，先知是在百姓偏离正道、陷于罪中时被差遣而来。因此，当我们读圣经中的先知书时，应当带着敬畏之心，预备聆听上帝的声音。

以赛亚就是这样的一位先知。他书卷的开头带我们回顾历史。在此之前，圣经中已经记载了《列王纪上下》、《历代志上下》、《以斯拉记》与《尼希米记》，我们知道以色列人因持续犯罪悖逆而被掳。但《以赛亚书》却带我们回到被掳之前的时光——那时，上帝仍借着先知发出警戒。

书卷伊始，以赛亚用一个强烈的图像开启信息：上帝称祂的百姓为“儿女”。“天哪，要听！地啊，侧耳而听！因为耶和华说：‘我养育儿女，将他们养大，他们竟悖逆我。’”（以赛亚书 1:2）他们就像背叛父亲的儿女。因此，审判的征兆已经显现——“你们的地土已成荒凉；你们的城邑被火焚烧。”（1:7）即便百姓仍献上祭物，这也不足以打动上帝的心。祂要的不是形式上的献祭，而是真实的悔改与顺服。祂恳切地呼唤：“你们要洗净、自洁，从我眼前除掉你们的恶行……你们若甘心听从，必吃地上的美物。”（1:16–19）只要百姓愿意回转，神必施恩、赦免，并赐下祝福；若执意不悔改，审判就必临到。

随后，以赛亚换了另一个比喻。他说神的百姓如同不贞的妻子：“可叹，忠信的城变为妓女！”（1:21）这比喻虽重，却显明神的爱有多深。在整本圣经中，神常以“丈夫”自称，视祂的百姓为“妻子”，深爱他们如深爱妻子一般。而当百姓悖逆时，就如同妻子弃绝丈夫的爱，去追随别的男人。

> [!important]+ 反思与回应
以赛亚的信息清晰明了：上帝是圣洁的，祂憎恶罪恶；但祂也是慈爱的父，愿意赦免悔改的人。祂的审判真实不虚，祂的恩典也深厚长存。当我们离弃罪恶，转向祂时，祂就必赦免、医治并再度接纳我们。

📖 **Passage to read**: ==Isaiah 01==

> [!info]- 🎙️Audio: [A Daily Devotional - 07.25 - EN]()  

When we hear the word “prophet” today, we often think of someone who tells the future. But in the Bible, a prophet is more than that. A prophet is someone who speaks for God—someone who tells God’s people what God wants them to hear. Often, that message comes when the people are living in sin and need to be corrected. So when we read the prophets in the Bible, we should expect to hear God’s voice through them.

Isaiah is one of those prophets. And when his book starts, we’re stepping back in time. Earlier books like 1 and 2 Kings and Chronicles have already told us how God’s people ended up in exile. But Isaiah takes us to the time before that—when God was still warning his people through the prophet.

Isaiah begins with a strong image: God calls his people his children. “Hear, O heavens, and give ear, O earth; for the Lord has spoken: ‘Children have I reared and brought up, but they have rebelled against me’” (1:2). They were like sons and daughters who had turned against their Father. Because of this, trouble had already started. Their land was damaged. Cities were burned. And though they were still offering sacrifices, it wasn’t enough. God didn’t just want sacrifices—he wanted their hearts. He wanted love and obedience. He called them to turn from their sins: “Wash yourselves; make yourselves clean.… If you are willing and obedient, you shall eat the good of the land” (1:16–19). God was ready to forgive and bless them—but only if they turned back to him.

Then Isaiah uses another picture. This time, he compares God’s people to a wife who has been unfaithful. “How the faithful city has become a whore” (1:21), he says. That may sound harsh, but it shows how deeply God cares. In many parts of the Bible, God speaks of his people as his bride. He loves them with deep affection, like a husband loves his wife. So when they turn to sin, it’s like a wife who walks away from a loving husband to chase after others.

> [!important]+ Reflect and Respond
Isaiah shows us two things clearly: God is holy and hates sin. But he also loves his people. His judgment is real. But so is his grace. When we turn from our sin and come back to him, he is always ready to forgive, restore, and love us again.
