### <center>希西家王</center>

> [!info]- 🎙️Audio: [A Daily Devotional - 05.26 - CN]()

希西家王与犹大百姓身处极大的危难之中。强大的亚述大军已经入侵他们的国土，就如同当年北国以色列所遭遇的一样。亚述王派来的使者在众人面前公然亵渎耶和华，极力恐吓百姓，声称他们将轻易击败犹大。百姓惶恐不安，只能等待他们的王作出回应。

希西家会如何应对呢？他没有转向偶像，也没有设法拟定什么巧妙的军事策略。相反，他做了一件更为有力的事——他谦卑地来到神面前祷告。

正是在这场危机中，我们看见了这位王真正的属灵品格。他自卑俯伏在神面前，深知惟有神才是他与百姓唯一的盼望。他承认神是那坚固的磐石，是他们的避难所。于是他祷告，称颂神为天地的创造主，又将亚述人所说的亵渎之言、百姓所面临的危局一一陈明在神面前。最后，他恳切地求神施行拯救。

留意他祷告的结尾：“耶和华我们的神啊，现在求你救我们脱离亚述王的手，使天下万国都知道惟独你——耶和华是神！”（列王纪下 19:19）希西家所求的，不是自己的荣耀，而是愿神的名得着尊崇。他盼望万国因神的作为而认识祂的独一无二。

神垂听了他的祷告，并以慈爱回应。此时，我们也首次见到将来将频繁出场的一位神人——先知以赛亚。他奉神差遣，将神的回应传给希西家。神明言自己察见了亚述人的狂傲，也看顾祂百姓的苦情。祂应许说：“我要使他从原路回去。”（19:28）

神果然信守诺言。就在那夜，亚述大军驻扎在耶路撒冷城外之时，耶和华的使者降临，在营中击杀了十八万五千人。天一亮，余下的亚述人醒来，只见遍地尸体。他们的王别无选择，只能撤军归回本地。神为祂的百姓争战，而他们甚至不必拔刀出鞘。

> [!important]+ 反思与回应
愿你今天花时间向神祷告，求祂指出你是否将信靠寄托于世上的事物。也求祂帮助你专心仰赖祂，无论是为得救，还是在每日与主同行的生命中。

### <center>King Hezekiah</center>

> [!question]+ Review
> 1. ⁠According to 2 Kings 17, why were the Israelites exiled to foreign lands? What sins led to God's judgment on them?
> 2. Did God give the Israelites a chance to repent before judgment? Through whom did He speak, and how did the people respond?
> 3. How does this passage reveal both God's justice and His mercy? How should we respond to God's warning and His salvation today?

📖 **Passage to read**: ==2 Kings 19==

> [!info]- 🎙️Audio: [A Daily Devotional - 05.26 - EN]()  

King Hezekiah and the people of Judah were in serious danger. The powerful Assyrian army had entered their land, just like it had done earlier in the northern kingdom. The messengers from the king of Assyria mocked God in front of everyone. They tried to scare the people by saying how easily they would be defeated. The people were afraid. But they waited to see how their king would respond.

What would Hezekiah do? He didn’t turn to idols. He didn’t try to come up with a clever military plan. Instead, he did something much more powerful. He went to God in prayer.

This is how we really see Hezekiah’s heart. He humbles himself before God. He knows that only God can save them now. He knows that God is the only one strong enough to help. So he prays. He praises God as the Creator of everything. Then he brings his troubles before the Lord. He reminds God of the enemy’s insults and the danger they all face. Finally, he pleads for deliverance.

And listen to how he finishes his prayer: “So now, O LORD our God, save us, please, from his hand, that all the kingdoms of the earth may know that you, O LORD, are God alone” (2 Kings 19:19). Hezekiah wants God to be glorified. He wants everyone to know that there is no god but the Lord.

God hears that prayer. And he responds with grace. The prophet Isaiah, a servant of God, brings the message. God sees the pride of Assyria and the suffering of his people. He makes a promise: “I will turn you back on the way by which you came” (19:28).

And God keeps his word. That very night, while the Assyrian army is camped outside the city, the angel of the Lord strikes down 185,000 soldiers. When the sun rises, the rest of the army sees only the dead. The king of Assyria has no choice but to retreat. God’s people are saved—and they didn’t even have to fight.

> [!important]+ Reflect and Respond
Spend time today asking God to show you where you’ve put your trust in things other than him. Ask him to teach you to rely on him fully—for your salvation, and for your daily walk with him.
