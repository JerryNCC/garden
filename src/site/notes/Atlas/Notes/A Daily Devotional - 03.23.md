### <center>基甸与真正的英雄</center>

> [!info]- 🎙️Audio: [A Daily Devotional - 03.23 - CN]()

基甸的故事讲述了一个意想不到的英雄。基甸可能是以色列人中最不被看好的一个人，没人会认为他能拯救以色列免于敌人的压迫。当耶和华的使者显现时，基甸这样回应：“主啊，我怎能拯救以色列呢？看哪，我家在玛拿西支派中是最弱的，我在我父家里也是最小的” (6:15)。基甸没有任何特别之处。他在自己家中都不是领导者，更不用说在整个以色列中了。随着故事的发展，我们也看到他并不是什么勇敢或信心十足的人！他要求神给他一个迹象，证明这位使者确实是从神那里来的。

即使在神给了他一个神迹后，基甸依然没有勇气在白天摧毁巴力的祭坛。他在晚上偷偷进行，没人看到他做这一切。当人们发现他是罪魁祸首时，他的父亲为他辩护，提出巴力应该自己保护自己。后来，基甸召集了一支军队来作战，但他仍然不完全相信神会通过他拯救以色列。于是他再次要求神给他一个迹象——神以耐心再次回应了他。

那么，神为什么选择基甸呢？基甸的故事教导我们的是，真正的英雄是神。神才是为祂的百姓成就一切的人。基甸或许是神使用的士师，但他并不是故事的英雄——神才是。神将拯救以色列脱离敌人的压迫，而这次，他选择了最不可能成为领袖的人来带领他们。通过这样做，神向祂的百姓表明，他们必须单单信靠神。

> [!important]+ 反思与回应
神可以在任何时候、任何地方使用任何人来完成祂的旨意。我们的责任是信靠祂、相信祂，并爱祂的儿子耶稣。今天，祈求神成为你故事中的英雄。求神帮助你看见自己的软弱，完全依靠祂。祈求神通过你成就伟大的事——也许是即使在你软弱的情况下——为了祂的荣耀。

### <center>Gideon and the Real Hero</center>

> [!question]+ Review
> 1. ⁠What courage and cleverness did Ehud demonstrate when facing King Eglon of Moab? How did these qualities help him fulfill God's purpose?
> 2. ⁠What is the message about sin and God's judgment conveyed through the vivid portrayal of King Eglon’s death? How does this imagery help us understand God's righteous judgment?
> 3. In this story, what does God's choice of an "unlikely hero" like Ehud signal to us? How can we learn to trust in God, even when we feel weak and powerless?

📖 **Passage to read**: ==Judges 06==

> [!info]- 🎙️Audio: [A Daily Devotional - 03.223 - EN]()  

The story of Gideon is about an unexpected hero. Gideon was probably one of the last people anyone would have thought would save Israel from its enemies. When the angel of the Lord appears to him, he says, “Please, Lord, how can I save Israel? My clan is the weakest in Manasseh, and I am the least in my father’s house” (6:15). There was nothing remarkable about Gideon. He wasn’t even a leader in his own family, let alone in Israel. As the story goes on, we see that he’s not exactly full of courage or faith, either. He demands signs to prove that the messenger is truly from God.

Even after receiving a miraculous sign, Gideon still hesitates to tear down the altar of Baal in broad daylight. He does it secretly at night when no one is watching. When the people find out what he’s done, his father defends him, arguing that Baal should be able to defend himself. Later, when Gideon gathers an army to fight, he’s still not fully convinced that God will deliver Israel through him. He asks for yet another sign—and, in God’s patience, God gives it.

So, why does God choose Gideon? The lesson of Gideon’s story is that God is the true hero. God is the one who gets things done for His people. Gideon may be the judge God uses, but he’s not the hero—God is. God will deliver Israel from their enemies, and in this case, He picks the most unlikely man to lead them. In doing so, God shows that His people must trust in Him alone.

> [!important]+ Reflect and Respond
God can use anyone, anytime, to accomplish His purposes. Our part is to trust Him, believe in Him, and love His Son, Jesus. Pray today that God would be the hero of your story. Ask God to help you see your own weakness and to rely completely on Him. Pray that He would accomplish great things through you—maybe even despite you—for His glory.
