### <center>耶稣的至高与充分</center>

> [!info]- 🎙️Audio: [None]()

耶稣是主，耶稣够用。这一句简单的话，几乎可以概括《歌罗西书》的全部信息。更准确地说，这封信强调的是耶稣基督的至高性与充分性。耶稣至高——祂是无限圣洁、智慧、全能的神，是万物的创造者。耶稣也充分——祂不仅足以拯救、赦免我们，也足以供应、支撑并引导我们度过基督徒的生活。保罗写给歌罗西教会的目的，就是高举耶稣，表明祂独自荣耀，足够满足祂子民的一切需要。

那么，为什么保罗觉得这信息如此重要？随着教会的发展，一些反对真实恩典福音的人悄悄渗入了教会。这在新约教会中常常发生，也是今天对我们的警告。关于所谓“歌罗西异端”的具体内容，学者们有不同看法，但很可能是一种受犹太教影响的神秘主义——一种奇怪的属灵追求，承诺更深的圣洁、更真实的知识或更高级的灵性境界。保罗写这封信的目的，就是向他们表明：在救恩和基督徒生活中，耶稣就足够了，别无所需。

在这段荣耀的经文中，保罗从三个方面高举耶稣。首先，耶稣是创造主。永恒存在的上帝之子在创造世界时同在其中，我们不可忘记这一点。其次，耶稣在神的教会中具有至高地位。保罗写道：“祂是教会全体的头，也是那从死里首先复生者”（1:18）。第三，耶稣带来和好。通过十字架的工作，我们得着永远的救恩、平安和赦免。唯有在基督里，我们因“祂的血”得以与神和好（1:20）。耶稣——创造主、教会的头、十字架的承载者。保罗仿佛在问：“你们为何还需要别的呢？”

> [!important]+ 反思与回应
你是否真正、切实地相信，耶稣够用？够力让你对抗罪恶吗？够力带给你最终的喜乐、满足和平安吗？保罗呼吁我们信靠：耶稣在各方面都是充分的。祷告吧，求神帮助你更完全地在救主里安息。

### <center>The Supremacy and Sufficiency of Jesus</center>

> [!question]+ Review
> 


📖 **Passage to read**: ==Colossians 01:15-23==

> [!info]- 🎙️Audio: [None]()  

Jesus is Lord, and Jesus is enough. That simple sentence could summarize the message of Colossians. More precisely, Paul argues for both the supremacy and the sufficiency of Jesus Christ. Jesus is supreme—the infinitely holy, wise, and powerful God, the Creator of all things. Jesus is sufficient—more than enough to save, forgive, sustain, and empower his people for the Christian life. Paul’s purpose in writing to the Colossians is to lift Jesus high, to show that he alone is glorious and enough for his people.

Why was this message necessary? As the church grew, certain people who opposed the true gospel of grace began to enter the community. This happened often in the New Testament churches—and it is a warning for us today. Scholars debate the details of the “Colossian heresy,” but it seems most likely to have been a form of Jewish-influenced mysticism—a strange spirituality promising deeper holiness, truer knowledge, or advanced spiritual power. Paul’s goal is to counter this by showing that nothing beyond Jesus is needed—for salvation or for living the Christian life.

In this passage, Paul lifts up Jesus in three ways. First, Jesus is the Creator. The eternally existent Son of God was active in creation. We must not forget this. Second, Jesus has primacy over the church. Paul writes, “He is the head of the body, the church,” and also, “the firstborn from the dead” (1:18). Third, Jesus brings reconciliation. Through his work on the cross, we receive eternal salvation, peace, and forgiveness. It is in Christ alone that we are reconciled to God, by the “blood of his cross” (1:20). Jesus is Creator, head of the church, bearer of the cross. Paul seems to ask, “Why would you need anything else?”

> [!important]+ Reflect and Respond
Do you really believe, in practice, that Jesus is enough? Enough to overcome sin? Enough to fill you with true joy, satisfaction, and peace? Paul calls us to trust that Jesus is sufficient in every way. Pray that you will believe this. Ask God to help you rest more fully in your Savior.
