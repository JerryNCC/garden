### 逃跑与躲藏

> [!info]- 🎙️Audio: [A Daily Devotional - 01.04 - CN]()

想象一个八岁的孩子听到妈妈说：“等你爸爸回家再说。” 对于一个知道自己闯祸的孩子来说，这句话无疑是最可怕的警告。它明确预示着惩罚即将到来。当他听到门开声和父亲的脚步声时，他脑子里只有一个念头：逃跑，躲起来！

这正是《创世记》第三章中亚当和夏娃的感受。他们因吃了神明确禁止的果子而违背了神。当他们听见神的脚步临近时，他们并没有试图辩解，而是像害怕的孩子一样逃跑，躲藏起来。

当神面对他们时，情况变得更加糟糕。亚当试图推卸责任，说：“你所赐给我与我同住的女人……” 换句话说，他不仅怪罪夏娃，还将责任推到神的身上！而夏娃则怪罪蛇，说：“那蛇引诱我，我就吃了。” 但神当然知道真相。虽然蛇（即撒但）要为它的欺骗负责，但亚当和夏娃也无法逃避自己的责任。

他们的惩罚是沉重的。他们失去了伊甸园的乐园，从此要面对劳碌、痛苦的生活。最终，他们的悖逆导致了死亡——不仅是他们自己的死亡，也包括所有后代的死亡。

乍看之下，《创世记》第三章似乎是一个彻底绝望的故事。罪进入了世界，随之而来的便是审判。但在这黑暗的篇章中，神赐下了一个充满希望的应许。在咒诅蛇的时候，神宣告夏娃的后裔将要伤蛇的头。创世记3章15节，这节经文常被称为“原福音”，因为它首次预示了耶稣的救赎计划。

即便在人类最黑暗的时刻，神仍显出祂的恩典。耶稣，这位道成肉身的神，正是那个后裔。祂最终战胜了撒但、罪恶和死亡。而祂赢得胜利的方式并不是逃避惩罚，而是亲自承担这惩罚。通过祂在十字架上的牺牲和复活，耶稣粉碎了撒但的权势，为我们赢得了永生。

> [!important]+ 反思与回应
> 请花一点时间思想这奇妙的恩典。在罪恶和审判之中，神竟然赐下了希望的应许。感谢祂赐下耶稣，为我们的罪付上代价，战胜死亡，让我们也能与祂同享胜利。这场战争并未失利——因为耶稣已经得胜！

### Run and Hide

> [!question]+ Review
> 1. What did the serpent say to make Eve question God’s word?
> 2. How did Eve respond to the serpent, and what did she do wrong?
> 3. Where was Adam during this event, and what was his role in what happened?

📖 **Passage to read**: ==Genesis 3:8-24==

> [!info]- 🎙️Audio: [A Daily Devotional - 01.04 - EN]()


Imagine an eight-year-old hearing his mom say, “Wait until your father gets home.” For a kid who knows he’s in trouble, those words are terrifying. It’s a clear warning that punishment is on the way. When he hears the door open and his dad’s footsteps, there’s only one thing on his mind: run and hide!

That’s a small glimpse of what Adam and Eve felt in Genesis 3. They had disobeyed God by eating the fruit He told them not to eat. When they heard God coming, they didn’t stand their ground or try to explain themselves. They ran and hid, just like scared children.

When God confronted them, things got even worse. Adam tried to shift the blame, saying, “The woman you gave to be with me...” In other words, he blamed not only Eve but even God! Eve, in turn, blamed the serpent, saying, “The serpent deceived me, and I ate.” But God knew exactly what had happened. While the serpent—Satan—was responsible for his part, Adam and Eve couldn’t escape accountability.

Their punishment was severe. They lost the paradise of Eden and faced a life of struggle, work, and pain. Ultimately, their disobedience would lead to death—not just for them but for all humanity.

At first glance, Genesis 3 seems like a story of complete despair. Sin has entered the world, and judgment follows. But in the middle of this dark chapter, God gives a promise that shines with hope. While cursing the serpent, God declares that one of Eve’s descendants will crush the serpent’s head. This verse, Genesis 3:15, is often called the protoevangelium, or “first gospel,” because it points to Jesus.

Even in humanity’s darkest moment, God shows grace. Jesus, God in human flesh, is the descendant who would one day defeat Satan, sin, and death. He would win this victory not by avoiding the punishment but by taking it on Himself. Through His death on the cross and His resurrection, Jesus crushed Satan’s power and secured eternal life for us.

> [!important]+ Reflect and Respond
> Take a moment to reflect on this amazing grace. Even in the midst of sin and judgment, God promised a way of hope. Thank Him for Jesus, who paid for our sins and defeated death so we could share in His victory. The war is not lost—because Jesus has already won!
