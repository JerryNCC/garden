### <center>这不是科幻小说</center>

> [!info]- 🎙️Audio: [None]()


美国空军的一系列电视广告展示的画面，看起来就像直接取自未来科幻电影。我们看到外太空的镜头和令人惊叹、奇异的科技。然后出现标语：“这不是科幻小说。”画面转为战斗场景或控制塔中的人。看似科幻的东西其实是真实的；我们的空军正在利用科技和军事进步做惊人的事情。这是一则有效的广告宣传。

彼得在谈论主耶稣基督再来的话题时，也提出了类似的观点。似乎有人开始质疑救主确实会回到地上。“他的应许在哪里呢？”有人问（3:4）。这种言论是危险的，而且似乎可能分散真正基督徒对现实的关注。彼得的回应就像那则空军广告：“这不是科幻小说；耶稣真的会再来！”他的确切话语是：“主的日子要像贼来到一样。那日，天必大有响声废去，天上的万象都要被烧毁溶解；地和其上的作为都要显露出来”（3:10）。主的日子要来——这不是科幻小说。当耶稣，这位伟大的审判者，真的再来时，这意味着在他的荣耀和圣洁面前，这罪恶的世界将被毁灭、受审并暴露无遗。我们该怎么办呢？

彼得在面对耶稣再来的应许时，对他的读者提出了极为实际的呼召。耶稣会再来。地将被火焰消融。我们应当做什么？我们应当在耶稣基督——我们的救主里——过圣洁顺服的生活。在这样的生活中，我们以期待救主再来的心，活出对耶稣的侍奉，来加速他再来的到来。你相信耶稣会再来审判这地吗？你是否以这样的信心来生活？

> [!important]+ 反思与回应
求神帮助你更加意识到他儿子耶稣基督将要再临到这个世界。祷告求他帮助你相信耶稣会再来——这不是科幻小说！然后求神帮助你以这种信念来生活。祷告求他赐力量，使你在每天跟随这位恩典救主时，追求圣洁和虔敬的生活。

### <center>It’s Not Science Fiction</center>

> [!question]+ Review
> 

📖 **Passage to read**: ==2 Peter 3.01-13==

> [!info]- 🎙️Audio: [None]()  

A series of television commercials for the United States Air Force shows scenes that look like they come straight from futuristic, science fiction movies. We see shots from outer space and amazing, weird technology. Then comes the tagline: “It’s not science fiction.” The shot morphs into a battle scene or a man in a control tower. What seems like science fiction is actually reality; our Air Force is doing amazing things with technology and military advancements. It’s an effective ad campaign.

Peter makes a similar point as he turns to the topic of the return of the Lord Jesus Christ. It seems that some people had begun to question the reality of our Savior’s return to this earth. “Where is the promise of his coming?” some were asking (3:4). This was dangerous talk, and it seems to have the potential to distract true Christians from reality. Peter’s response is like that Air Force commercial: “It’s not science fiction; Jesus really is coming back!” His exact words are, “The day of the Lord will come like a thief, and then the heavens will pass away with a roar, and the heavenly bodies will be burned up and dissolved, and the earth and the works that are done on it will be exposed” (3:10). The day of the Lord is coming—it’s not science fiction. When Jesus, the great Judge, does return, it will mean the destruction, judgment, and exposure of this sinful world before his glory and holiness. What do we do about it?

Peter’s call to his audience in light of this coming return is actually intensely practical. Jesus is coming back. The earth is going to be dissolved by fire. What should we do? We should live holy and obedient lives in Jesus Christ, our Savior. In this kind of living, we serve to hasten the coming of Jesus as we wait expectantly for our Savior to come. Do you believe Jesus is coming back to judge this earth? Are you _living_ like you believe that?

> [!important]+ Reflect and Respond
_Ask God to make you more conscious of the return of his Son, Jesus Christ, to this world. Pray that he would help you believe that Jesus is coming back—it’s not science fiction! Then ask God to help you live in a way that is mindful of this fact. Pray that he would give you strength to pursue holiness and godliness as you follow your gracious Savior every day._
