### 攻击神的话语

> [!info]- 🎙️Audio: [A Daily Devotional - 01.04 - CN](https://drive.google.com/file/d/10Inpf2fcxI_fzqzI3CYHXb5VOm6yiXaO/view?usp=drive_link)

诺曼底登陆，是二战中最著名的战役之一。这场战役被无数电影、书籍和电视节目所展现。对于盟军来说，这场战役至关重要，尽管他们付出了约一万人的伤亡代价。在任何战争中，总有一些关键地带决定胜负，而诺曼底的滩头就是这样一个地方。盟军在那里取得的胜利迫使德军退出了法国大部分地区，这也成为整个战争的转折点。

在《创世记》3章1到7节中，我们看到了一场截然不同的战斗。这场战斗不是发生在滩头，而是围绕着神话语的真理展开。蛇，也就是撒但，选择神的话语作为攻击的目标。注意蛇所说的第一句话：_“神岂是真说……”_ 它的策略是让夏娃怀疑神话语的可信性。夏娃应该怎么做呢？她应该坚定地回答：“是的，神说了！我相信！祂的话语完全真实，我会完全顺服。” 但她没有这样做。相反，她开始扭曲神的话语，并在其中添加自己的意思。撒但看到这一点后，进一步诱惑她和亚当，用知识和生命的诱饵，引他们背离神的话语，走向悖逆。

那么，亚当在哪里呢？如果亚当在场，他一定会阻止蛇的谎言迷惑夏娃吧。然而，第6节清楚地告诉我们：“她又给她丈夫，他也吃了。”亚当一直在场，他目睹蛇质疑神的话语，也看着夏娃开始怀疑神，却什么也没说，什么也没做。

在这个悲惨的时刻，蛇攻击了神的话语，夏娃对其产生了怀疑，而亚当没有挺身捍卫。最终，他们一同背叛了神，罪就这样进入了世界。这是一个令人心碎的场景。

> [!important]+ 反思与回应
> 今天，从感恩神的话语开始你的祷告。你是否在怀疑它的真实性？你是否在其中添加了自己的想法？当有人挑战神的真理时，你是否选择了沉默？祈求神帮助你更留心祂的话语，并忠心地遵行。

### Attack on God’s Word

> [!question]+ Review
> 1. According to Genesis 2:15, what does the Bible teach about the purpose of work, and how is it different from how work is often viewed today?
> 2. How did God guide Adam in his work and life in the garden? What role did God's word play?
> 3. What does Genesis 2:24 reveal about the relationship between man and woman, and why is it significant in God’s design?

📖 **Passage to read**: ==Genesis 3:1-7==

> [!info]- 🎙️Audio: [A Daily Devotional - 01.04 - EN](https://drive.google.com/file/d/17LsVyxClLxkxDeH-LppWx1IpSlpAyt9P/view?usp=drive_link)

The invasion of Normandy during World War II, often called D-Day, is one of the most famous battles in history. It has been depicted in countless movies, books, and TV shows. This battle was critical for the Allies, costing them around ten thousand casualties. Certain locations in any war are key to securing victory, and the beaches of Normandy were such a place. The Allied victory there pushed the German army out of most of France and became a turning point in the war.

In Genesis 3:1–7, we find a different kind of battle. This battle isn’t fought on a beach but on the truth of God’s word. The serpent—Satan—chooses God’s word as the main target for his attack. Notice the very first thing the serpent says: _“Did God actually say …?”_ His strategy is to make Eve question the reliability of God’s word. What should Eve have done? She should have responded boldly: “Yes, God said it! I believe it! His word is completely true, and I will obey it.” But she doesn’t. Instead, she begins to twist God’s word, adding to it. Seeing this, Satan moves in for the next step, luring her and Adam into rebellion by promising them knowledge and life outside of God’s word.

Where is Adam in all this? Surely, if he were there, he would stop the serpent from deceiving Eve. But verse 6 tells us exactly where Adam is: “She took of its fruit and ate, and she also gave some to her husband who was with her.” Adam was there the whole time, watching as the serpent questioned God’s word and as Eve began to doubt it. Yet he said and did nothing.

In this tragic moment, the serpent attacks God’s word, Eve doubts it, and Adam fails to defend it. Together, they rebel against God, and sin enters the world. It is a heartbreaking scene.

> [!important]+ Reflect and Respond
> Begin today by thanking God for his word. Are you struggling to trust it? Do you find yourself adding your own ideas to it? Are there times you fail to stand up for its truth? Ask God to help you listen to his word more closely and to follow it faithfully.
