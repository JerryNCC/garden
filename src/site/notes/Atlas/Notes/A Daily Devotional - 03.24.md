### <center>微弱的军队</center>

> [!info]- 🎙️Audio: [A Daily Devotional - 03.24 - CN]()

你是否曾经历过生活中某些美好的事情，明明知道自己无法为其功劳背锅？当然，最典型的例子就是我们的救赎和罪得赦免。那是一个我们永远无法自诩的恩赐，而《士师记》第7章正指向这一不可思议的恩典——这是只有神能成就的事，我们无法为其获得任何功劳。

神向基甸明确表达了他的旨意：“你和你的人数太多，我不能把米甸人交在你们手中，免得以色列人因我给他们胜利而自夸，说：‘我的手救了我’”（7:2）。神的目的很清楚，就是不让以色列人以为他们的胜利是靠自己的力量赢得的。神要以色列人毫无疑问地明白，只有神才能拯救他们。

接下来是奇怪的征战准备。首先，基甸让所有害怕的人离开，结果三分之二的军队散去了，只剩下万分之一的兵力。神还不满足。基甸带着剩下的士兵来到一处水源，按照他们喝水的方式把人分开！最后，基甸只剩下三百人——一个弱小的军队，任何标准下都不值一提。但这正是神预备使用的军队。

了解基甸的胆怯之后，神让他偷偷进入米甸人的营地，鼓励他。在那里，基甸听到一人讲述一个梦，另一人则说出基甸将击败米甸人的话。听了这番话，基甸鼓起勇气，带领这支微弱的军队去征战。夜深人静时，他们包围了米甸人的营地，出其不意。接着，基甸和他的军队打破了瓦罐并大声喊叫，神让米甸人陷入混乱。最终，米甸人在混乱中互相残杀，战争迅速取得了胜利。

这场胜利之所以伟大，并非基甸的力量或军队的规模，而是神的能力和恩典。这再次提醒我们，正是在我们的软弱中，神才成就了真正的胜利。

> [!important]+ 反思与回应
今天，花点时间反思神那极其丰盛且完全不配得的救恩。记住我们这些罪人是如何通过耶稣基督得到赦免的，感谢祂所赐的我们无法赚得的恩典。今天的祷告中，把一切的荣耀归给神吧！

### <center>A Weak Army</center>

> [!question]+ Review
> 1. ⁠Why does Gideon feel he cannot save Israel? What specific limitations and challenges did Gideon face in his family and tribe?
> 2. Why did God choose a weak and fearful Gideon to lead the people of Israel? What message does this choice communicate to the people of Israel?
> 3. How do we see God's work surpassing human ability and limitations in the story of Gideon? How do you understand God's grace and salvation?

📖 **Passage to read**: ==Judges 07==

> [!info]- 🎙️Audio: [A Daily Devotional - 03.24 - EN]()  

Have you ever experienced something good in your life, something you knew you couldn't take credit for? The ultimate example of this is, of course, our salvation and forgiveness in Christ. It’s the kind of gift we can never claim for ourselves, and Judges 7 points to this incredible gift—something that only God can accomplish, and we can never take credit for.

God makes His purpose clear to Gideon: "The people who are with you are too many for Me to give the Midianites into their hands, lest Israel boast over Me, saying, ‘My own hand has saved me’" (7:2). God’s goal here is to make sure that no one could ever claim the victory was because of their own strength. He wants Israel to know—beyond a shadow of a doubt—that only He could save them. 

So the strange preparations for battle begin. First, Gideon sends home anyone who is afraid. Over two-thirds of the army leaves, leaving him with just ten thousand men. But God isn’t done yet. Gideon takes these remaining men down to a body of water and separates them based on how they drink! Finally, Gideon is left with just three hundred men—a small, weak army by any standard. But this is the army God is ready to use.

Knowing how fearful Gideon is, God sends him down into the Midianite camp to encourage him. There, Gideon overhears one man sharing a dream, and the other man declares that Gideon will defeat the Midianites in battle. Encouraged by this, Gideon leads his small army into battle. In the dead of night, they surround the Midianite camp and surprise them. Then, as Gideon and his men break their clay jars and shout, God causes confusion to fall on the Midianites. The battle is quickly won, as the Midianites, disoriented, end up fighting and killing each other. 

This is a great victory—not because of Gideon’s strength or the size of his army, but because of God’s power and grace. It’s another reminder that, even in our weakness, God is the one who brings about victory.

> [!important]+ Reflect and Respond
Today, take a moment to reflect on God’s overwhelming and totally undeserved salvation. Remember how sinners like us are forgiven through Jesus Christ, and thank Him for the grace we could never earn. Let the credit for everything go to God in your prayers today!
