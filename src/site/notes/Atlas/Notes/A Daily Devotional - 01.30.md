当七年的饥荒蔓延到整个地区时，粮食短缺严重影响了各地——唯独埃及例外。约瑟因着神的指引，预见了这场饥荒，并制定了周密的准备计划。埃及的粮仓储满了粮食，确保了生存所需。来自世界各地的人开始涌向埃及求粮，最终，约瑟的兄弟们也来到了这里。他们认不出身着埃及统治者服饰的约瑟，而约瑟利用这一点，指控他们盗窃，甚至将他们最小的弟弟便雅悯扣为人质。或许，约瑟是在试探他们是否为过去的罪行感到悔恨，或者他只是享受这种身份逆转的时刻。  

最终，约瑟再也无法隐藏自己的身份。他情不自禁地向兄弟们坦白说：“我是约瑟！”（创45:3）。这场团聚充满了情感的波澜。约瑟完全有权惩罚这些曾将他卖为奴隶的兄弟们。然而，他选择了饶恕。他与他们抱头痛哭，安慰他们，不要为过去的事忧虑。他用这样充满力量的话语，总结了神在他生命中的作为：“从前你们的意思是要害我，但神的意思原是好的，为要成就今日的光景，使许多人的性命得以保全。”（创50:20）。  

创世记的结尾，雅各全家迁往埃及，生活在约瑟的照料与供应之下。这是神的计划——拯救祂的子民，赐福他们，正如祂曾应许亚伯拉罕的那样。但这并不是他们故事的结束。出埃及记的第一章将揭示他们即将面对的新挑战。  

> [!important]+ 反思与回应
我们所事奉的神，常常将恶事化为祝福。耶稣基督的十字架是这一点的终极证明。借着祂爱子的受难与死亡，神为所有悔改并信靠祂的人带来了救恩、饶恕与永生。今天，花些时间来赞美这位满有救赎大能的神吧！

### <center>God meant it for good</center>

> [!question]+ Review
> 1. What transformation happened to Joseph’s identity and position from the beginning to the end of Genesis 41? What does this reveal about God’s work?  
> 2. What future events did God reveal through Joseph’s interpretation of Pharaoh’s dreams? How did Joseph act wisely with God’s guidance?  
> 3. The end of Genesis 41 mentions that "all the earth" came to Joseph to buy food. How does this foreshadow God’s promise to Abraham? What lessons can we learn for our faith today?

📖 **Passage to read**: ==Genesis 45==

> [!info]- 🎙️Audio: [A Daily Devotional - 01.30 - EN]()

As the seven years of famine spread across the region, food shortages hit hard everywhere—except Egypt. Joseph, by God’s guidance, had predicted the famine and organized a careful plan to prepare for it. Egypt’s storehouses were full, ensuring survival. People from all over began to come to Egypt for food, and eventually, Joseph’s own brothers appeared. They didn’t recognize Joseph, now dressed as an Egyptian ruler, and he used this to his advantage. He accused them of theft and even held their youngest brother, Benjamin, as ransom. Was Joseph testing them to see if they regretted their past actions, or was he simply savoring the reversal of roles?  

Eventually, Joseph could no longer keep his identity hidden. Overcome with emotion, he revealed himself to his brothers, saying, “I am Joseph!” (45:3). The reunion was deeply emotional. Joseph had the power to punish his brothers for their betrayal—selling him into slavery so many years ago. Instead, he chose forgiveness. Joseph wept with them, reassured them, and urged them not to worry. He summed up his view of God’s work in his life with these powerful words: “You meant evil against me, but God meant it for good, to bring it about that many people should be kept alive, as they are today” (50:20).  

Genesis ends with all of Jacob’s family moving to Egypt, where they live under Joseph’s care and provision. This was God’s plan—to save His people and bless them, just as He had promised Abraham. But this isn’t the end of their story. The first chapter of Exodus will show us new challenges ahead.  

> [!important]+ Reflect and Respond
We serve a God who can take what is meant for evil and use it for good. The cross of Jesus Christ is the ultimate example of this. Through the suffering and death of His Son, God brought salvation, forgiveness, and eternal life to anyone who repents and believes in Him. Take a moment to praise God for His redeeming power today!
