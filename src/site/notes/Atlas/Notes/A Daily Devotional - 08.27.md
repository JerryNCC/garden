### <center>牧者王</center>

> [!info]- 🎙️Audio: [None]()

像许多先知一样，弥迦展望一个审判之后神子民得以复兴的日子。然而，本章特别回答了关于这复兴的几个关键问题：神的子民将如何得复兴？谁将永远带领并治理他们？弥迦指出有一位要成就这一切的人——一位牧者王。

先知描述，这位王将出自伯利恒这小镇，将以大能、公义与真理治理百姓。他是一位牧者王，保护神的子民，使他们安稳，并为国家带来平安。这位王也要拯救他们脱离一切敌人。但他的影响不仅限于以色列。那些由他带领的神子民余民，将“在多民中立定”，并“像林中之狮，在群兽中显扬”（5:7–8）。弥迦强调，这位王将引领神的子民进入显赫与荣耀，即便是在审判之后。

更进一步，这位牧者王将结束神子民中的偶像崇拜和罪恶。他将执行神对悖逆列国的审判：“我必向不顺从的列国施行报应”（5:15）。

在马太福音2章中，东方博士远道而来寻找新生王的故事，也呼应了弥迦的预言。希律因听闻此王的诞生而心怀忧虑，便向当时的学者询问，学者引用了弥迦书第5章的预言。牧者王不仅是普通的人类君王，而是神的独生子亲自成就了这预言。耶稣通过十字架的死，为神的子民带来永恒的保障。他借着救恩建立荣耀的子民，并藉着死而复活战胜罪与死亡。

> [!important]+ 反思与回应
我们需要耶稣作为我们的王，完美地统治我们的生命并牧养我们。今天就当感谢神，赐给我们这样慈爱又得胜的王。花几分钟时间祷告，赞美他的大能与慈爱。

📖 **Passage to read**: ==Micah 05==

> [!info]- 🎙️Audio: [None]()  

Micah, like many other prophets, looks ahead to a day of restoration for God’s people after judgment. This chapter, however, gives specific answers about that future: How will God’s people be restored? Who will lead and rule them forever? Micah points to one person who will accomplish all of this—a shepherd king.

The prophet describes a king who will come from Bethlehem, a small town, and rule with power, goodness, and truth. He will be a shepherd king, keeping God’s people safe and bringing peace to the nation. This king will also protect them from all enemies. But his influence is not limited to Israel alone. The remnant of God’s people led by this king will stand “in the midst of many peoples” and be exalted “like a lion among the beasts of the forest” (5:7–8). Micah emphasizes that this king will lead God’s people into prominence and glory, even after judgment.

More than that, this shepherd king will end idolatry and sin for God’s people. He will carry out God’s judgment on disobedient nations: “I will execute vengeance on the nations that did not obey” (5:15).

In Matthew 2, the story of the wise men traveling to see the newborn king recalls Micah’s prophecy. Herod, troubled by the news of this king, consults the scholars who cite Micah 5. The shepherd king is no mere human ruler. God’s own Son fulfills this prophecy. Jesus provides eternal security for God’s people through his death on the cross. He establishes a glorious people through salvation and conquers sin and death by dying and rising again.

> [!important]+ Reflect and Respond
We need Jesus as our King to rule our lives and shepherd us perfectly. We can thank God today for giving us this loving and victorious King. Take a few minutes to pray, praising him for his goodness and care.
