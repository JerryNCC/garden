### <center>罪恶的人口普查</center>

> [!info]- 🎙️Audio: [A Daily Devotional - 05.01 - CN]()

本章开头的句子令人感到既陌生又沉重：“耶和华又向以色列人发怒，就激动大卫使他吩咐人去数点以色列人和犹大人。”（24:1）但若你翻到《历代志上》第21章中相同的记载，会发现另一番说法：在那里，是撒但引诱大卫犯下这件恶事。两段经文看似矛盾，实则揭示了一个深刻的真理：上帝是全权掌管的主，甚至连邪恶的作为也在祂的计划之中，为要成就祂荣耀的旨意。

大卫的罪，在我们今天看来，似乎不是什么大事——他只是决定统计自己国中的人口。但这次普查并非单纯的行政行为，它反映出大卫内心的偏移：他开始依赖人数和军事力量，而不是单单信靠上帝来保守祂的百姓、战胜仇敌。他的元帅约押看出其中的危险，苦劝他不要这样做。然而，大卫固执己见，最终还是执意而行。

人口普查结束后，大卫心中沉重。他意识到自己得罪了神。也正因如此，大卫被称为“合神心意的人”。他没有为自己辩解，而是诚实认罪，转向上帝。但尽管他的悔改是真诚的，罪的后果依然不可避免。这一次，祸患也临到了百姓身上。上帝降下瘟疫在以色列中，是祂的怜悯拯救了耶路撒冷，使这座城免于彻底毁灭。

章节末尾记载了一件看似平凡的事情——大卫从耶布斯人亚劳拿手中买下一块打谷场。表面看像是一桩普通的交易，但这却是神圣计划的一部分。将来，大卫的儿子所罗门将要在这块地上建造圣殿，为耶和华的名立一个居所。这段故事正悄悄地引导我们展望未来——神要在祂的百姓中间亲自居住。即便是在人类的罪与悔改之中，上帝仍然在预备祂那伟大的救赎计划。

> [!important]+ 反思与回应
如果大卫的故事教会了我们什么，那就是：神是信实的。祂对大卫信实——赦免他的罪，继续使用他。祂对祂的百姓信实——为他们预备一位忠心的王，藉着他保护并赐福于他们。今天，让我们因神对我们一如既往的信实而感恩，也因我们如今所跟随的“大卫的子孙”——耶稣基督——而欢喜快乐。祂成就了神对祂百姓一切的应许。

### <center>The Sinful Census</center>

> [!question]+ Review
> 1. Why did the three warriors risk their lives just to get a cup of water for David? What does this show about their attitude toward their king?
> 2. Why did David refuse to drink the water and instead pour it out before the Lord? What does this act reveal about how he viewed his warriors?
> 3. Uriah the Hittite appears last in the list of mighty men. How does this remind us of David's failure? And how does it point us to the need for a greater King?

📖 **Passage to read**: ==2 Samuel 24==

> [!info]- 🎙️Audio: [A Daily Devotional - 05.01 - EN]()  

This chapter begins with a strange and serious note: “Again the anger of the LORD was kindled against Israel, and he incited David against them” (24:1). If you look at the same story in 1 Chronicles 21, you'll notice something interesting—it says that Satan incited David. These two accounts seem to say different things. But what we learn from this is important: God is so sovereign, so in control, that even evil can end up serving his good and glorious purposes.

Now, David’s sin might not seem like a big deal to us. He decides to count the people in his kingdom. But this census wasn’t just a neutral act of administration. It showed something deeper—David was starting to rely on numbers, on military strength, instead of trusting God alone to protect and lead his people. Joab, his commander, saw the danger and warned him not to go through with it. But David ignored the warning and went ahead anyway.

When the counting was finished, David’s heart was heavy. He knew he had sinned. This is what makes David a man after God’s own heart. He didn’t make excuses. He admitted his wrong and turned back to God. But even though he repented, the sin still had consequences—not just for David, but for the people too. God sent a plague on Israel. It was only by God’s mercy that Jerusalem was spared from total destruction.

As the chapter ends, we read about something that seems small—a purchase. David buys a threshing floor from Araunah the Jebusite. But this moment is not random. That very spot will become the site where Solomon builds the temple of God. The story is quietly pointing us forward—to a time when God will dwell among his people in a special way. Even here, through David’s sin and repentance, God is laying the groundwork for his greater plan.

> [!important]+ Reflect and Respond
If the story of David teaches us anything, it teaches us this: God is faithful. He stayed faithful to David—he forgave him and continued to use him. And he stayed faithful to his people—providing for them, protecting them, and preparing a future for them. Today, we can thank God for that same faithfulness. And we can rejoice that we now follow the greater Son of David, Jesus Christ—the one who fulfills all of God’s promises to his people.
