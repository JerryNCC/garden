### <center>全能的　神</center>

> [!info]- 🎙️Audio: [A Daily Devotional - 07.29 - CN]()


在《以赛亚书》第六章中，我们看见以赛亚蒙召成为先知。神差遣他向百姓传递一个沉重的信息——审判的信息。因为他们的罪、悖逆与拜偶像已经到了极点。到了第八章末尾，局势愈发黑暗绝望：“他们必望地而见艰难、黑暗、和幽暗的痛苦”（8:22）。这就是罪的可怕后果，而神的圣洁则显明这罪是何等严重！

正因如此，第九章一开始便让人意外。“但那受过痛苦的必不再见幽暗。”（9:1）若说第八章充满了神审判的阴霾，第九章则宣告这阴霾的终结！对神的百姓而言，盼望尚存。审判不是故事的终点。那么，这转变要如何发生？

以赛亚介绍了一位人物——祂将带来光明、盼望与和平。这位君王不同于以往的任何君王。你或许在圣诞节时听过这段话：“在黑暗中行走的百姓看见了大光；住在死荫之地的人，有光照耀他们。”（9:2）神的百姓因自己的罪败坏受尽击打，但将来他们要重新站立，重新得着喜乐与光明。神应许将赐下一位婴孩，一位儿子。以赛亚毫不吝啬地描述这孩子的荣耀与大能：“政权必担在祂的肩头上；祂名称为奇妙策士、全能的　神、永在的父、和平的君。”（9:6）

许多年后，在那正当的时候，一位婴孩诞生了——卑微地降生在马槽中。这婴孩就是神的儿子，道成了肉身。祂并不是百姓所期待的那种君王——祂没有带领军队，没有复兴耶路撒冷的荣耀。祂来，是要为祂的百姓舍命，为要赎罪，并从死里复活，为他们永远战胜死亡。以赛亚所预言的，正是这位伟大的救主——成了肉身的全能的　神。

> [!important]+ 反思与回应
今天，请你停下片刻，感谢神赐下耶稣。赞美祂在我们黑暗中施行的拯救。祂赐给我们最深的需要——不是暂时的安逸，而是赦罪的救恩和永远的平安。

### <center>Mighty God</center>

> [!question]+ Review
> 1. ⁠What did Isaiah see in his vision? What does this vision mean for him—and for us?
> 2. How did Isaiah respond when he saw the holiness of God? What attitude should we have when we encounter God’s holiness?
> 3. ⁠After God forgave Isaiah’s sin, He called him to serve. Are you willing to respond to God’s calling like Isaiah did? 

📖 **Passage to read**: ==Isaiah 09:01-07==

> [!info]- 🎙️Audio: [A Daily Devotional - 07.29 - EN]()  

In Isaiah 6, we saw Isaiah’s call to be a prophet. God told him to bring a hard message to the people—a message of judgment. Their sin, rebellion, and idol worship had gone too far. At the end of Isaiah 8, things look bleak: “They will look to the earth,” Isaiah says, “but behold, distress and darkness, the gloom of anguish” (8:22). That’s how bad things are. Sin brings darkness. And God’s holiness brings judgment.

That’s why the beginning of Isaiah 9 is so surprising. Just when we expect only more gloom, we hear something different: “But there will be no gloom for her who was in anguish.” The darkness won’t last forever. Yes, judgment has come—but that’s not the end. There’s still hope for God’s people.

And that hope comes through a person. Isaiah describes someone who will bring light, joy, and peace. He’ll be a king—but not like any other king. You’ve probably heard these words before: “The people who walked in darkness have seen a great light” (9:2). This is the promise of someone special. The world is full of sin and sadness, but God is sending someone who will change everything.

Who is this person? Isaiah tells us: a child, a Son. But this is no ordinary child. Isaiah says, “The government shall be upon his shoulder,” and gives him amazing names: “Wonderful Counselor, Mighty God, Everlasting Father, Prince of Peace” (9:6). This child is the Mighty God himself, come to save.

Years later, this promise came true. A baby was born—not in a palace, but in a manger. He didn’t come with soldiers or a crown. He came quietly, to live, die, and rise again. That baby was Jesus. He didn’t overthrow Rome or bring earthly power. He came to deal with the real problem—our sin. He came to die so that we could live.

Isaiah was pointing us to Jesus all along. In the middle of judgment, he spoke of hope. That hope is still true for us today. Jesus is the Mighty God who came in the flesh to save his people.

> [!important]+ Reflect and Respond
Take a moment to thank God for Jesus. Praise him for sending the light into our darkness. He gave us what we needed most—not comfort or ease, but a Savior who would deal with our sin and bring us peace forever.
