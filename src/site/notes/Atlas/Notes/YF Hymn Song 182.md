**Verse 1**
When I fear my faith will fail  
Christ will hold me fast  
When the tempter would prevail  
He will hold me fast  
I could never keep my hold  
Through life's fearful path  
For my love is often cold  
He must hold me fast

**Chorus**
He will hold me fast  
He will hold me fast  
For my Savior loves me so  
He will hold me fast

**Verse 2**
Those He saves are His delight  
Christ will hold me fast  
Precious in His holy sight  
He will hold me fast  
He'll not let my soul be lost  
His promises shall last  
Bought by Him at such a cost  
He will hold me fast

**Chorus**
For my life He bled and died  
Christ will hold me fast  
Justice has been satisfied  
He will hold me fast  
Raised with Him to endless life  
He will hold me fast  
Till our faith is turned to sight  
When he comes at last
