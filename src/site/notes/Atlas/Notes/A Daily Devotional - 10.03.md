### <center>复活与生命</center>

> [!info]- 🎙️Audio: [None]()

请再次思想约翰福音11:1–44，让这件神迹重新震撼你的心。耶稣使拉撒路从死里复活。拉撒路并不是半死不活，而是完全死去，像任何一个人真正的死亡。然而，创造天地的主，只说了三个字：“拉撒路，出来！”（11:43）。死亡就不得不顺服。耶稣一开口，死亡就退去，生命就临到。

耶稣再次向我们显明祂是谁——祂是生命与死亡的主宰。这就是这神迹的真实含义。耶稣，就是道成肉身的上帝，对全宇宙万物拥有绝对的权柄。

但这里还有另一层更深的教训。耶稣显明祂的身份，是为爱祂的人得益处。我们很难明白（马大和马利亚当时也难以明白），为何耶稣要延迟，不立刻前去医治，而是让拉撒路真的死去。但这是祂爱的计划。请注意约翰的记载：“耶稣素来爱马大和她妹子，并拉撒路。听见拉撒路病了，就在所居之地仍住了两天。”（11:5–6）。你是否看见了那个关键的字眼“就”？正因为祂爱他们，祂才选择延迟。祂任凭拉撒路死去，是要借此向他们显明祂的荣耀。

为什么耶稣要这样做？为什么祂会容许祂所爱的朋友死去，好让祂的荣耀得以彰显？答案很清楚：因为人能看见神儿子的荣耀，并且信靠祂，这是世上最宝贵的恩典。唯有这样，人才能得着永远不死的生命。耶稣所追求的，不是短暂的地上国度，而是永恒的天国——一个因信祂是复活与生命而聚集的子民。

> [!important]+ 反思与回应
所以，关键就在耶稣对马大的提问：“你信这话吗？”（11:26）。这是这段经文的核心。愿她的回答也成为你的回答。让我们向神祷告，求祂坚固我们对耶稣的信心。唯有在祂里面，才有永生；唯有在祂里面，才有复活的大能。

### <center>The Resurrection and the Life</center>

> [!question]+ Review
> 1. In John 8:22 and 27, what kind of misunderstanding did the Jews have in their dialogue with Jesus? What does this reveal about their problem in recognizing his identity?
> 2. When Jesus used the phrase “I am” to describe himself, how did the Jews react? What does this show about the significance of this statement at that time?
> 3. John 8:30 mentions that “many believed in him.” According to the article, where does such faith come from?

📖 **Passage to read**: ==John 11:01-44==

> [!info]- 🎙️Audio: [None]()  


Think again about John 11:1–44, and let the miracle sink in. Jesus raised Lazarus from the dead. Lazarus was not partly sick or half-dead; he had fully died, like any man dies. Yet Jesus—by whose power the world was made—spoke only three words: “Lazarus, come out” (11:43). And death itself had to obey. At the voice of Jesus, death gave way to life.

Once more, Jesus is showing us who he is. He is the Lord of life and death. That is what this sign means. Jesus, God himself in human flesh, has total authority over all creation.

But we also learn something more here. Jesus reveals his identity in a way that blesses those who love him. What seems so hard for us to understand (and it was hard for Mary and Martha too!) is that Jesus’s delay—his choice to let Lazarus die—was part of his plan of love. Notice how John puts it: “Now Jesus loved Martha and her sister and Lazarus. So, when he heard that Lazarus was ill, he stayed two days longer in the place where he was” (11:5–6). Did you catch that little word _so_? Because he loved them, he stayed. He allowed Lazarus to die out of love, so that his glory would be revealed to them.

Why would Jesus do this? Why would he let his close friend die in order to show his glory? The reason is clear: seeing the glory of the Son of God, and believing in him, is the very best gift we can receive. That is the way to life that never ends. Jesus was not aiming to build a passing kingdom on earth. He is gathering a people for an eternal kingdom, a people who believe that he truly is the resurrection and the life.

> [!important]+ Reflect and Respond
And so the question for us is the same one Jesus asked Martha: “Do you believe this?” (11:26). That is the heart of the passage. Pray that her answer would be yours as well. Ask the Lord to make your faith strong in Jesus, his Son. Only in him is there eternal life. Only in him is the power of resurrection.
