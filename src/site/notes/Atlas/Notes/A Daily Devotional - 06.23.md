### <center>知识不同于智慧</center>

> [!info]- 🎙️Audio: [A Daily Devotional - 06.23 - CN]()


以利户是个年轻人，出于对约伯三位年长朋友的尊重，他一直等到现在才开口。但他可不腼腆！他“怒气发作”（约伯记32:3），对约伯坚持自己的义和忠心感到生气，对那三位朋友没能给约伯的苦难一个清楚有力的解释更是愤怒。以利户开始讲话时，我们期待他能带来新的见解，真正的智慧。但很快我们发现，他的答案并不比其他三位朋友高明。他说了些关于神的真话，却在约伯的处境上用错了。

以利户稍微扭曲了约伯的话，声称约伯说：“人以神为乐，毫无益处”（约伯记34:9）。约伯从没这么说！他确实提到过，恶人有时亨通，义人却受苦，但他从未说敬畏神毫无价值。在10至30节中，以利户长篇论述神的权能、公义和伟大。他说得没错——神不能作恶，祂掌管世界，惩罚恶人，垂听受苦者的呼求。以利户对神的性情描述得准确无误！

但到这一章结束时，我们看到以利户的问题。他虽然知道关于神的真理，却无法正确应用在约伯身上。和其他三位朋友一样，他把约伯归为恶人，以为神在愤怒中审判他。他说：“约伯说话没有知识”（约伯记34:35），甚至希望约伯“受试炼直到极处，因他回答像恶人一样”（约伯记34:36）。以利户知道很多关于神的知识，却不真正明白神。他和其他朋友一样，目光短浅，将约伯的苦难归咎于悖逆。

> [!important]+ 反思与回应
今天，求神赐你对祂的知识，让你在祂的话语和道路上不断成长。但也要祈求圣灵帮助你与神建立亲密的关系，好让你能智慧地运用这些知识，活出真理。

### <center>Knowledge Is Different Than Wisdom</center>

> [!question]+ Review
> 1. ⁠What behaviors does Job list in Job 31:1-35 to demonstrate his faithfulness? How do these behaviors reflect his fear of God?  
> 2. Why does Job boldly cry out in Job 31:35, “Let the Almighty answer me”? What does this reveal about his belief regarding his suffering and God’s justice?  
> 3. The devotional notes that Job is not boasting but affirming his faithfulness in response to his friends’ accusations. How can we understand the relationship between Job’s suffering and God’s judgment of sin?


📖 **Passage to read**: ==Job 34==

> [!info]- 🎙️Audio: [A Daily Devotional - 06.23 - EN]()  

Elihu’s a young guy, waiting quietly out of respect for Job’s older friends before jumping into the talk. But he’s not holding back! He’s fired up, mad at Job for claiming he’s righteous and even madder at the three friends for not giving a solid answer to Job’s suffering (32:3). As Elihu starts talking, we wonder if he’ll bring something fresh, some real wisdom. But pretty soon, it’s clear he’s got no better answers than the others. He says true things about God, but he gets it wrong when it comes to Job.

Elihu twists Job’s words a bit, saying Job claimed, “It’s no use to follow God” (34:9). That’s not what Job said! Job pointed out that wicked people sometimes do well while good people suffer, but he never said trusting God is pointless. In verses 10–30, Elihu goes on about God’s power, justice, and greatness. He’s right—God can’t do evil, He rules the world, He punishes the wicked, and He hears the cries of the hurting. Elihu’s got the facts straight about who God is!

But as the chapter wraps up, we see Elihu’s problem. He knows true things about God but doesn’t apply them right to Job’s life. Like the other friends, he lumps Job in with the wicked, saying God’s judging him for sin. “Job talks without knowing,” he says (34:35), and even wishes Job’s suffering would keep going because he sounds like a bad guy (34:36). Elihu knows a lot about God, but he doesn’t understand Him well. He’s shortsighted, just like the others, pinning Job’s pain on rebellion.

> [!important]+ Reflect and Respond
Pray today that God fills you with knowledge of Him—keep growing in His Word and His ways. But pray too that His Holy Spirit helps you know Him personally, so you can use that knowledge wisely and live it out.
