### <center>敬畏上帝</center>

> [!info]- 🎙️Audio: [A Daily Devotional - 07.21 - CN]()


“人生是旅程，不是终点。”这是当今社会常听到的一句话。许多人说，寻找本身就很有意义，即使你未必找到答案，也没关系。只要不断发问，保持开放的心就好。但《传道书》并不这样看。所罗门不认为人生的寻找是永无止境的。在他看来，寻找终将落脚在某个地方。而那最终的归宿，正是《箴言》和整本智慧文学所强调的主题——敬畏上帝。

《传道书》第十二章以一句清晰的命令开篇：“你趁着年幼、衰败的日子尚未来到，就是你所说，‘我毫无喜乐’的那些年日未曾临近之先，当记念造你的主。”（传道书 12:1）所罗门特别对年轻人说话——那些人生才刚刚起步的人。他告诉他们，人生中最智慧、最有意义的抉择，就是现在就选择归向上帝。在第2到第8节中，他用极具诗意的语言描绘了年老的景象，把逐渐衰败的身体比作一座日久失修的房屋，也用自然界的图像表达人的老去。所罗门要传达的意思很简单：趁年轻，将自己献给上帝。

接着，他给出了整卷书的总结：“这些事都已听见了。总意就是：敬畏上帝，谨守他的诫命，这是人所当尽的本分。”（传道书 12:13）所罗门讲了许多话。他在人生的每一个角落寻找意义。他曾追求智慧、劳碌、享乐与财富。如今，走遍人生百态之后，他归纳出一句话：敬畏上帝，遵行他的命令，这就是人生的全部。人生的意义，不在于我们自己去发明，而是在那位创造我们、察看我们一切行为的上帝那里找到。

既然我们已走到《传道书》的末了，不妨问问自己：我们的寻找是否也可以在此止步？所罗门——还有主耶稣基督自己——都邀请我们，不再漂泊，而是归回那位创造主。在他里面，你将找到自己被造的意义和最深的归属感。

> [!important]+ 反思与回应
因此，求上帝帮助你真正相信：意义、目的和满足，只在他里面。求他赐你信心，使你在年幼的日子就选择他——趁着还没有衰败、还不觉艰难的时刻。他是创造你的主，将来也要作审判你的主。求他帮助你现在就为他而活，藉着信靠他的儿子耶稣基督，过一个讨他喜悦的生命。

### <center>The Fear of God</center>

> [!question]+ Review
> 1. ⁠In Ecclesiastes 9:2, Solomon says, “The same event happens to all.” How does this verse highlight the universality of death? What kind of attitude should we have in light of this truth?
> 2. Ecclesiastes 9:10 says, “There is no work or thought or knowledge or wisdom in Sheol, to which you are going.” What does this verse tell us about how we should live now? How should we value the ordinary gifts of life from God?
> 3. In Ecclesiastes 9:11–12, Solomon talks about the unpredictability and uncertainty of life. How do you understand his view on “chance” and “timing”? What spiritual reminders can you take from this passage?

📖 **Passage to read**: ==Ecclesiastes 12==

> [!info]- 🎙️Audio: [A Daily Devotional - 07.21 - EN]()  


“Life is a journey, not a destination.” That’s a common saying today. People often say the search is what matters, even if you never find the answers. Just keep asking questions. Stay open. But Ecclesiastes doesn’t take that route. Solomon doesn’t think the search goes on forever. For him, the search ends. It lands somewhere. And where it lands is right where Proverbs and all of wisdom literature lands: the fear of God.

Ecclesiastes 12 begins with a clear command: “Remember also your Creator in the days of your youth” (12:1). Solomon is speaking to the young—people just starting out in life. He says the wisest, most meaningful choice you can make is to choose God now. In verses 2 to 8, he gives a poetic picture of aging. He compares it to a house falling apart and uses images from nature to describe how the body breaks down. Solomon’s point is simple: give yourself to God while you’re still young.

Then comes the conclusion. “All has been heard,” he says (12:13). Solomon has said a lot. He’s searched for meaning in every corner of life. He’s tested wisdom, work, pleasure, and wealth. And now, after it all, he tells us what it comes down to: “Fear God and keep his commandments, for this is the whole duty of man” (12:13). That’s what life is about. God. Listening to him. Living under his word. He made us, and one day he will judge every secret thing. Meaning is not something we invent. It’s found in the one who made us and sees everything we do.

So now that we’ve reached the end of Ecclesiastes, the question is: have we come to the end of our search? Solomon—and Jesus himself—invites us to stop searching and come home. In your Creator, you’ll find the meaning you were made for.

> [!important]+ Reflect and Respond
So ask God to help you believe that. Ask him to help you trust that your deepest purpose and your truest joy are only found in him. And if you’re young, ask him to help you choose him now—before the days come when it’s harder. He created you. And one day, you’ll stand before him. Ask him to help you live now, through faith in Jesus, for the one who gave you life.
