### <center>羔羊的血</center>

> [!info]- 🎙️Audio: [A Daily Devotional - 02.04 - CN]()

神为首次逾越节给祂的子民下达了非常具体的指示。他们被告知如何准备和烹饪羔羊，以及如何将羔羊的血涂在每家门框的横梁上。这些仪式对今天的我们来说或许显得陌生，但对于以色列人来说，却蕴含着深远的意义。那么，作为基督徒的我们，应该如何理解《出埃及记》第十二章？

首先，我们需要明白这段经文在圣经整体故事中的位置。在《出埃及记》中，逾越节是神救赎的一个有力象征。事实上，这是旧约中最清晰展现神拯救大能的事件之一。在最后一灾——击杀长子之灾中，神为祂的子民提供了一条逃避审判的途径。祂吩咐以色列人要把自己置于逾越节记号之下。而这个记号是什么呢？是血——羔羊的血，被涂抹在房屋的门框上。这血成为保护他们的标志。当神看到这血时，祂便越过这些房屋，保全屋内的人免受审判和死亡。在本章两处经文中（《出埃及记》12:28, 50），我们读到神的子民遵守了祂的吩咐。因为他们顺服了神的话语，他们得以脱离灾难。

随着圣经故事的发展，这次逾越节事件成为了一个模式，预示着更伟大的救赎行动。逾越节指向十字架上的救赎，神的儿子耶稣为祂的子民而死。耶稣作为三位一体中的第二位，取了人的样式，并被称为“神的羔羊”（约翰福音1:29）。这个称呼绝非偶然。神赋予耶稣这个名字，是为了让我们想起首次逾越节的伟大救恩。正如以色列人借着羔羊的血得以存活，我们也因耶稣的血得救。以色列人并不完美；他们和埃及人一样，理应受到审判。但神为他们提供了一条出路——通过一只无瑕羔羊的牺牲，逃避祂的审判。同样，耶稣这位完美的神的羔羊，牺牲了自己，用祂的血遮盖我们，救我们脱离死亡。祂的工作完全实现了逾越节所预表的一切。

> [!important]+ 反思与回应
请花点时间感谢神，因耶稣的牺牲而越过你的罪过。求神每天帮助你记住，你的救赎并不依赖于你所做的任何事，而是因着耶稣的血。祂是我们唯一的盼望。信靠祂，那完美的神的羔羊！

### <center>The Blood of the Lamb</center>

📖 **Passage to read**: ==Exodus 12==

> [!info]- 🎙️Audio: [A Daily Devotional - 02.05 - EN]()  

God gave his people very specific instructions for the first Passover. They were told how to prepare and cook the lamb and how to spread its blood on the lintel—the crossbeam over the door of each house. These rituals may seem strange to us today, but they carried deep meaning for the Israelites. So how should we, as Christians, understand a chapter like Exodus 12?

First, we need to see how this chapter fits into the Bible’s larger story. In the book of Exodus, the Passover stands out as a powerful picture of God’s salvation. In fact, it’s one of the clearest demonstrations of God’s saving power in the entire Old Testament. During the final plague—the death of the firstborn—God provided his people with a way to escape judgment. They were told to place themselves under the sign of the Passover. And what was that sign? It was blood—the blood of a lamb smeared on the doorposts of their homes. This blood was the mark that protected them. When God saw the blood, He passed over those houses, sparing the people inside from judgment and death. Twice in this chapter (Exodus 12:28, 50), we’re told that God’s people obeyed His instructions. Because they followed His word, they were saved.

As the story of the Bible unfolds, this event becomes a pattern for a much greater act of salvation. The Passover points forward to the cross, where God’s Son, Jesus, dies to save His people. Jesus, the second person of the Trinity, became human and took on the title “Lamb of God” (John 1:29). That name wasn’t given by accident. It was chosen by God to remind us of the first Passover. Just as the Israelites were spared through the blood of a lamb, we are saved through the blood of Jesus. The Israelites weren’t perfect; they deserved judgment just as much as the Egyptians did. But God gave them a way out—a way to escape His judgment through the sacrifice of a spotless lamb. In the same way, Jesus, the perfect Lamb of God, sacrifices Himself to cover us with His blood and save us from death. His work is the ultimate fulfillment of what the Passover foreshadowed.

> [!important]+ Reflect and Respond
Take a moment to thank God for passing over your sins because of Jesus’s sacrifice. Ask Him to help you remember each day that your salvation doesn’t depend on anything you’ve done, but on the blood of Jesus. He is our only hope. Trust in Him, the perfect Lamb of God!
