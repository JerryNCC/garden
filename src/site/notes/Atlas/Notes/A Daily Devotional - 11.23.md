### <center>自相矛盾的信仰</center>

> [!info]- 🎙️Audio: [None]()


在教会早期，基督徒团体是一个彻底不同的群体。人们敬拜耶稣为主，相信死人必复活，并以恩典与宽恕彼此相爱。这是一个反文化的社区，许多帖撒罗尼迦信徒在艰难世界中发现，教会才是他们真正的家。

然而，帖撒罗尼迦的教会中出现了问题。也许是因为他们期待耶稣随时再来，或者因为教会中有人表现出慷慨，有些信徒开始懒惰。他们停止工作，依赖其他弟兄姊妹的恩惠。

在保罗看来，“懒惰的基督徒”是荒谬的。跟随耶稣的人，不应当用信仰、教会或神的爱作为懈怠的借口。保罗举自己的例子：“你们知道我们在你们中间的时候，怎样为人作榜样；我们并没有懒惰，也没有白吃人的饭，乃是劳苦工作，昼夜劳碌”（3:7–8）。保罗勤奋工作，信仰不仅没有让他偷懒，反而让他更努力。保罗明确命令：信徒应当勤奋工作。

你是否在生活中也发现自己有懒惰的倾向？你是否曾用基督教的说法为不努力找借口——无论是在学校、运动、音乐、工作，还是在家庭生活中？认识耶稣应该激励你比不信的人更加努力。你不是为了赢得神的喜悦而工作，因为在耶稣里，恩典已赐给你。但对神的爱与对恩典的感恩，应推动你为救主的荣耀勤奋工作。

> [!important]+ 反思与回应
祷告吧，求神指示你生活中懒惰的地方。我们很少将这种软弱带到神面前，但今天可以开始。求神让你看见属灵生活中懈怠的地方，求他帮助你在学业、运动、音乐和工作中充满活力、喜乐与勤勉。求他帮助你以全心回应耶稣的恩典，在一切所做之事上努力尽责。

📖 **Passage to read**: ==2 Thessalonians 03:06-15==

> [!info]- 🎙️Audio: [None]()  

In its early days, the Christian church was a radical community. People worshiped Jesus as Lord, affirmed the resurrection of the dead, and loved one another with grace and forgiveness. It was countercultural, and many Thessalonian believers found that the church was their true home in a difficult world.

Yet something went wrong in Thessalonica. Perhaps because they expected Jesus to return soon, or because they experienced generosity in the church, some members became lazy. They stopped working, relying on the kindness of others in the congregation.

To Paul, the idea of a lazy Christian makes no sense. A follower of Jesus should never use faith, church, or God’s love as an excuse to avoid hard work and discipline. Paul points to his own example: “You know how you ought to imitate us, because we were not idle when we were with you, nor did we eat anyone’s bread without paying, but worked night and day with toil and labor” (3:7–8). Paul worked hard. Christianity did not make him take it easy—it made him work even harder. He gives a clear command: believers should work diligently.

Do you see signs of laziness in your own life? Do you sometimes use Christian language to excuse not working hard—in school, sports, music, work, or at home? Knowing Jesus should motivate you to work even harder than those who do not know Him. You are not working to earn God’s favor—His grace in Jesus is already yours. But love for God and gratitude for His grace should push you to work hard for His glory.

> [!important]+ Reflect and Respond
Pray that God would show you areas of laziness in your life. We rarely bring this to Him in confession, but we should. Ask Him to reveal where you are idle spiritually. Pray for energy, joy, and diligence in school, sports, music, and work. Ask Him to help you respond to Jesus’ grace with wholehearted effort in everything you do.
