### <center>比风暴更可畏</center>

> [!info]- 🎙️Audio: [None]()

我们常常读到这个故事，就立刻联想到自己的困境，想到人生的“风暴”，并期望耶稣来平息它们。然而，这段经文的重点并不是我们个人的风暴，而是更伟大的真理。

门徒们当时确实身处险境。他们正在渡加利利海，忽然起了猛烈的风暴。狂风怒号，波浪冲击船身，船几乎要被淹没（4:37）。其中有几位是熟悉此海的渔夫，他们见过无数风浪，但这次的风暴超出了他们的能力，他们完全无助。于是他们唤醒正在船上睡觉的耶稣，急切地说：“夫子，我们丧命，你不顾吗？”（4:38）

耶稣醒来，吩咐风和海，风浪立刻平静，完全安稳。这神迹的能力令人震撼。但请注意接下来的情节：风暴止息后，门徒并没有因此感到安全，反而心里生出更深的惧怕。马可甚至没有说明他们在风暴中曾害怕，他们最大的恐惧是在风暴平息之后——他们惧怕与他们同船的这位。

为什么呢？因为他们亲眼看见了一种无法解释、无法掌控的权能。他们面对这样的问题：“这到底是谁，连风和海也听从他？”（4:41）这正是本段经文的核心。马可要我们明白门徒当时尚未看清的事实：耶稣不仅是一位有智慧的教师，也不仅是一位有能力的领袖；祂是神的儿子，是创造的主，拥有对万物绝对的权柄。

这段故事并不是在应许耶稣会除去我们生活中所有的难处，而是要我们面对一个更大的现实——祂是谁。真正的问题不在于海上的风暴，而在于那位命令海洋的主。我们必须亲自回答门徒所问的问题：这人到底是谁？

> [!important]+ 反思与回应
求神开启我们的眼睛，使我们真认识耶稣。祈求神赐下信心，使我们能欢喜且坚定地承认：祂是神的儿子——我的救主，我的王。

### <center>Scarier Than Storms</center>

> [!question]+ Review
> 1.⁠ ⁠How does the opening of Mark’s Gospel clearly declare Jesus’ identity and mission?
2.⁠ ⁠What important message is given by the voice from heaven at Jesus’ baptism?
3.⁠ ⁠What is the main message Jesus proclaims when He begins His ministry?

📖 **Passage to read**: ==Mark 04.35-41==

> [!info]- 🎙️Audio: [None]()  


We often read this story and quickly think about our own troubles. We talk about the “storms of life” and expect Jesus to calm them for us. But this passage is not mainly about our personal storms. Something bigger is going on here.

The disciples are in real danger. They are crossing the Sea of Galilee when a fierce storm hits. The wind roars, the waves crash into the boat, and it begins to fill with water (4:37). Several of these men are experienced fishermen. They know this sea well. But this storm is beyond their skill. They are helpless. They wake Jesus, who is asleep, and cry out, “Teacher, don’t you care that we are perishing?” (4:38).

Then Jesus gets up. With a simple word He commands the wind and the sea, and everything becomes completely calm. The power of this miracle is breathtaking. But notice what happens next. Instead of feeling safe and relieved, the disciples are filled with a deeper fear. Mark does not even tell us they were afraid of the storm itself. Their greatest fear comes after the storm is gone. They are terrified of the man in the boat.

Why? Because they have just witnessed a power they cannot explain or control. They are faced with the question, “Who then is this, that even the wind and the sea obey him?” (4:41). That question is the heart of the passage. Mark wants us to see what the disciples cannot yet see. Jesus is not just a wise teacher or a gifted leader. He is the Son of God, the Lord of creation, the one with total authority over nature itself.

This story does not promise that Jesus will remove every trouble from our lives. Instead, it confronts us with the far greater reality of who He is. The real issue is not the storm on the sea, but the person who commands the sea. We must answer the disciples’ question for ourselves. Who is this man?

> [!important]+ Reflect and Respond
Ask God to open your eyes to the truth of Jesus. Pray for faith to confess with joy and confidence that He is the Son of God—your Savior and King.
