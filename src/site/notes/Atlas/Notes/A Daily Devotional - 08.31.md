### <center>撒迦利亚的异象</center>

> [!info]- 🎙️Audio: [None]()


以色列列王辉煌的日子早已过去。耶路撒冷被拆毁，荒凉一片。神的百姓必须重新开始，许多人或许疑惑，生活是否还能回到从前的样子。他们对未来的盼望已十分微弱。

先知撒迦利亚就是在这样的处境中向百姓说话。神赐给他异象，提醒他们前方的盼望——关于神的子民、神的居所，以及神借着所应许的弥赛亚所施行的统治。

在其中一个异象里，撒迦利亚看见一个人手拿准绳，要去丈量耶路撒冷的城。撒迦利亚与这人——其实是一位天使——说话的时候，又有另一位天使前来，带来令人惊喜的信息：“耶路撒冷必有人居住，好像无城墙的乡村，因为其中的人畜甚多。”（撒迦利亚书2:4） 这座如今显得软弱渺小的城，将来必充满生机。神的城虽眼下脆弱，却有蒙福的未来。神的子民必再一次在祂的同在中昌盛。

天使继续传达神的应许：“我要作耶路撒冷四围的火城，并要作其中的荣耀。”（撒迦利亚书2:5） 神亲自要作祂子民的保护，作他们的保障。更奇妙的是，祂应许要住在他们中间，以祂的荣耀充满他们。这个应许更是扩展：“那时，必有许多国归附耶和华，作祂的子民。祂要住在你中间。”（撒迦利亚书2:11） 撒迦利亚所见的，是一个未来：万国万民要聚集起来，与神永远同住。

这异象不仅仅是指当时的耶路撒冷，它更指向所有神子民的最终盼望。借着对弥赛亚耶稣基督的信心，我们与各族各方的子民一同，在永恒里与神同住。

> [!important]+ 反思与回应
神借着耶稣成就救恩。祂就是那应许的弥赛亚，为我们的罪而死，使一切信靠祂的人得着永生。你的盼望如今在哪里呢？祷告求神，使你常常仰望祂永恒的计划，在其中得着真正的盼望。

### <center>Zechariah’s Vision</center>

> [!question]+ Review
> 1.⁠ ⁠Why was Habakkuk troubled and complaining to God at the beginning?
2.⁠ ⁠How did God respond to Habakkuk concerning the sins of His people?
3.⁠ ⁠In Habakkuk’s prayer in chapter 3, why was he able to say, “Yet I will rejoice in the LORD, I will be joyful in God my Savior”?

📖 **Passage to read**: ==Zechariah 02==

> [!info]- 🎙️Audio: [None]()  


The days of Israel’s great kings had long passed. Jerusalem was broken down, left in ruins. God’s people had to begin again, and many must have wondered if life could ever be as it once was. Their hope for the future was faint.

It is to these people that the prophet Zechariah speaks. God gave him visions to remind them of what lies ahead—visions of God’s people, God’s dwelling place, and God’s rule through the promised Messiah.

In one of these visions, Zechariah sees a man carrying a measuring line, ready to measure the city of Jerusalem. As Zechariah speaks with him—an angel—another angel arrives with a surprising word: “Jerusalem shall be inhabited as villages without walls, because of the multitude of people and livestock in it” (2:4). What seems small and weak will one day be full of life again. The city of God, though fragile now, has a future of blessing. God’s people will once more flourish in his presence.

The angel continues with God’s promise: “I will be to her a wall of fire all around … and I will be the glory in her midst” (2:5). God himself will protect his people. He will be their security. More than that, he promises to dwell among them, filling their lives with his glory. And the promise reaches even further: “And many nations shall join themselves to the LORD in that day, and shall be my people. And I will dwell in your midst” (2:11). Zechariah sees a future when people from every nation will be gathered to live with God forever.

This vision is not only about the city of Jerusalem as it was then. It points to the greater hope for all God’s people. Through faith in the Messiah, Jesus Christ, we—together with people from every tribe and tongue—will dwell in the presence of God for eternity.

> [!important]+ Reflect and Respond
God brings salvation through Jesus, who came as the promised Messiah. He died for our sins and secured eternal life for all who trust in him. Where is your hope today? Pray that God will keep your eyes fixed on his eternal plan, so that you may find true hope in him.
