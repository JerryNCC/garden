### <center>耶稣变像</center>

> [!info]- 🎙️Audio: [None]()

在童话《美女与野兽》中，一个骄傲的王子拒绝了门前一位衣衫褴褛的老妇人。但这老妇人立刻在他眼前变成了一位光彩照人的女巫，王子这才恍然大悟，原来他受到了试炼。在《马太福音》17:1–13中，我们也看见类似的事发生在耶稣身上。短短片刻之间，门徒得以透过他平凡的外貌，看见他真实的身份——他在天上荣耀中的显现。

耶稣带着彼得、雅各和约翰上了高山。仅仅这一点，就让我们意识到有大事即将发生。忽然，他们眼前的耶稣改变了。他的面貌发光如日头，他的衣裳洁白如光。在他身边，站着两位伟大的先知——摩西和以利亚。他们与耶稣交谈，那一幕几乎无法用言语描绘，光辉、美丽与圣洁充满整个场景。

这一刻显明了耶稣真正的身份。他不仅是那位为罪人受苦的卑微救主，他更是永恒的君王，满有神圣的荣耀，拥有审判万有的权柄。门徒所见的，正是神儿子的真貌——威严、尊荣、无与伦比。

一如既往，彼得急切开口，却不知该说什么。但这时，天父亲自发声。从光明的云彩中，有声音宣告：“这是我的爱子，我所喜悦的，你们要听他！”（17:5）这是父神对儿子的公开印证。耶稣是蒙神拣选的君王，是父神所喜悦的，我们当听从他。门徒因见到基督的荣光，战兢俯伏在地。

这对我们意味着什么呢？这意味着我们必须正确看待耶稣。他是荣耀的审判主，亦是温柔的救主，为我们舍命，用他的话语引导我们。神呼召我们要听从他，顺服他，敬拜他。

> [!important]+ 反思与回应
今天，请你思想这位耶稣，既满有荣耀，又充满温柔。感谢神赐下他的儿子。聆听他，顺服他，用你的祷告、言语与行为敬拜他。

> [!question]+ Review
> 1.⁠ ⁠How did Peter first confess Jesus’ identity, and how did Jesus respond to his confession?
2.⁠ ⁠Why was Peter unable to accept Jesus’ teaching about suffering and the cross?
3.⁠ ⁠According to Matthew 16:24–25, what does Jesus call his disciples to do in order to follow him?

📖 **Passage to read**: ==Matthew 17.01-13==

> [!info]- 🎙️Audio: [None]()  

In the fairy tale *Beauty and the Beast,* a proud young prince rejects a poor old woman at his door. But she suddenly changes before his eyes into a radiant enchantress, and he realizes too late that he has been tested. In Matthew 17:1–13, something similar happens with Jesus. For a brief time, his disciples see past the ordinary appearance of their teacher. The curtain is pulled back, and they glimpse his true identity—shining in heavenly glory.

Jesus takes Peter, James, and John up on a mountain. That alone tells us that something important is coming. Suddenly, before their eyes, Jesus is changed. His face shines like the sun. His clothes are bright with glory. And standing with him are two great prophets—Moses and Elijah. They speak with him there, and the disciples witness a sight almost too wonderful for words. The scene overflows with beauty, light, and holiness.

This moment shows us who Jesus really is. He is not only the humble Savior who came to suffer for sinners. He is also the eternal King, filled with divine glory, the one with authority to judge the world. The disciples are seeing him as he truly is—the majestic Son of God.

Peter, as usual, speaks quickly, not knowing what to say. But then God himself speaks. From the bright cloud, a voice declares: “This is my beloved Son, with whom I am well pleased; listen to him” (17:5). The Father places his seal of approval on the Son. Jesus is the chosen King, the one God delights in, the one to whom we must listen. And the disciples, overcome with awe, fall on their faces before the glory of Christ.

So what does this mean for us? It means we must see Jesus clearly. He is the glorious Judge and Lord of all. But he is also the gentle Savior who gave his life for us and leads us with his word. God calls us to listen to him. To obey him. To worship him.

> [!important]+ Reflect and Respond
Take time today to reflect on Jesus in both his glory and his gentleness. Thank God for sending his Son. Listen to him. Worship him in your prayers, your words, and your actions.
