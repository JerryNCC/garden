**Emma:** Hi Liam! Do you believe honesty is still a common trait in today’s world? _(Present Simple)_

**Liam:** Hi Emma! Yes, I do believe that. But it seems harder to find sometimes. For example, some salespeople might not always demonstrate honesty during a sale. _(Present Simple + Modal Verb)_

**Emma:** I agree. Last week, I bought something that cost much more than it was worth. I found out later that the evidence inside the box didn’t match the product description! _(Simple Past)_

**Liam:** Oh no! Did you complain to the store? _(Simple Past)_

**Emma:** Yes, I did. They said they would investigate, but I’m not sure they’ll do anything about it. _(Simple Past + Future Simple)_

**Liam:** That’s frustrating. Next time, you should check the product carefully ahead of paying. _(Modal Verb + Present Continuous)_

**Emma:** You’re right. I’ll try to remember that. By the way, how do you stay independent when making decisions? _(Future Simple + Present Simple)_

**Liam:** Good question. I always rely on my belief that making proper choices comes from understanding the situation and gathering enough evidence. _(Present Simple)_

**Emma:** That makes sense. Yesterday, I read about a master who talked about managing time effectively. He demonstrated how small changes could lead to big improvements. _(Simple Past + Modal Verb)_

**Liam:** I’ve heard about him too! He once said that prioritizing tasks is like putting big rocks in a pocket—you have to focus on the important things first. _(Present Perfect + Simile)_

**Emma:** Exactly! It reminded me of something my teacher said about memory. She mentioned that keeping a clear mind helps us remember better. _(Simple Past)_

**Liam:** That’s true. A clear mind works best when you avoid distractions and stay centered on your goals. _(Present Simple + Adjective Use)_

**Emma:** Thanks, Liam. I’ll try to practice what you’ve said.
