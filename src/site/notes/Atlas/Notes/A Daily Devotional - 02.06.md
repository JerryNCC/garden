### <center>羔羊的血</center>

**走干地过红海**  

法老顽固的心终于被击碎了，他答应让上帝的子民离开埃及。然而，很快，法老和埃及人又开始后悔他们的决定：“我们做了什么？我们竟然放走了以色列人，这下失去了他们的劳役！”（出埃及记14:5）。于是，上帝再一次使法老的心刚硬。这最后的行动将让埃及人，以及所有目睹这一切的人，毫无疑问地知道唯有祂是独一的真神。  

当我们深入这章经文时，首先注意到上帝子民的态度和反应。就在几天前，上帝以奇迹般的方式救他们脱离奴役，并通过羔羊的血保全了他们的孩子。然而，现在，当他们面临困境时，他们却立刻对摩西发怒，并质疑上帝。当他们看到法老的军队逼近时，他们的话充满了怀疑、愤怒和恐惧：“难道埃及没有坟墓，你把我们带到旷野来死吗？你为什么把我们从埃及领出来？”（出埃及记14:11）。他们的信心瞬间崩溃。  

到了第9节，以色列人被困住了。法老的军队在他们身后，红海挡在他们面前，已经无路可退。在这看似绝望的时刻，上帝通过摩西对祂的子民说出了充满安慰的话：“耶和华必为你们争战，你们只管静默，不要作声。”（出埃及记14:14）。接着，上帝以无与伦比的大能分开了红海，使祂的子民走在干地上。当法老的军队跟随他们进入海中时，海水重新合拢，将法老和他的军队完全吞没。上帝以震撼人心的方式拯救了祂的子民。  

通过这件事，上帝向祂的子民显明了一个关键的真理：那位拯救他们脱离埃及奴役的上帝，必然也会继续救他们脱离一切敌人和危险。祂没有在救赎之后就抛弃他们。祂在逾越节保全了他们，现在又以实际行动保护他们，向他们展示祂将会持续供应他们每一步的需要。  

这一真理同样适用于我们。如果你已经悔改并信靠耶稣基督，上帝已经赦免了你的罪。但祂的工作并未止步于此！祂仍然与你同在，保护你的心灵，守护你的信心，使你能为祂而活。上帝不仅是你过去的救主，更是你现在的依靠和未来的盼望。

今天，请花时间感谢上帝的救恩，赞美祂在你生命中的同在和保护。无论面对怎样的挑战，祂始终与你同在，坚固你的信心，指引你前行。

> [!question]+ Review
> 1.⁠ ⁠How did God instruct the Israelites to prepare the Passover lamb in Exodus 12?  
> 2.⁠ ⁠What is the symbolic significance of the lamb's blood in the Passover event? How does it foreshadow the redemption through Jesus Christ?  
> 3.⁠ ⁠According to the article, why is our salvation not dependent on anything we do, but rather on the blood of Jesus?


📖 **Passage to read**: ==Exodus 14==

> [!info]- 🎙️Audio: [A Daily Devotional - 02.06 - EN]()  

Pharaoh's heart was finally broken, and he agreed to let God's people go. However, soon after, Pharaoh and the Egyptians began to regret their decision: "What have we done? We’ve let the Israelites go, and now we’ve lost their labor!" (Exodus 14:5). God once again hardened Pharaoh’s heart. This final action would make the Egyptians, and all who witnessed it, know without a doubt that only God is the one true God.

As we dive into this passage, we first notice the attitude and reactions of God’s people. Just a few days ago, God miraculously saved them from slavery and protected their children with the blood of the lamb. Yet now, when they are in a difficult situation, they immediately turn on Moses and question God. When they see Pharaoh’s army closing in, their words are filled with doubt, anger, and fear: “Is there no grave in Egypt that you brought us to the wilderness to die? Why did you bring us out of Egypt?” (Exodus 14:11). Their faith crumbled in an instant.

By verse 9, they were trapped. Pharaoh’s army was behind them, the Red Sea in front of them, and there was no way out. In this seemingly hopeless moment, God spoke words of comfort through Moses: "The Lord will fight for you; you need only to be still" (Exodus 14:14). Then, with unmatched power, God parted the Red Sea, allowing His people to walk through on dry land. When Pharaoh’s army followed them into the sea, the waters returned, completely drowning Pharaoh and his forces. God powerfully delivered His people.

Through this event, God revealed a key truth to His people: the God who saved them from slavery in Egypt would also continue to save them from all enemies and dangers. He did not abandon them after their redemption. He protected them at the Passover, and now He demonstrated His ongoing protection, showing them that He would continue to provide for their every need.

This truth also applies to us. If you have repented and placed your faith in Jesus Christ, God has forgiven your sins. But His work doesn't stop there! He is still with you, protecting your heart, guarding your faith, and helping you live for Him. God is not only your Savior from the past but also your present support and future hope.

Today, take time to thank God for His salvation and praise Him for His presence and protection in your life. No matter what challenges you face, He is always with you, strengthening your faith and guiding you forward.
