神对亚伯拉罕及其后裔的应许必将实现，神必定继续对祂的百姓忠诚，但这一切似乎需要很长时间。如果《创世记》是一本讲述神赐福给祂子民的书，《出埃及记》是一本讲述神如何将祂的百姓从奴役中拯救出来并带领他们敬拜的书，《利未记》是一本讲述神对祂赎回百姓的律法的书，那么《民数记》则像是一本“我们到了吗？”的书。以色列人在《民数记》中的整个过程中都在旷野里漂流，他们一次又一次地失败，缺乏对神的信心，但依然继续经历神对他们的信实与耐心。

《民数记》第一章描述了神的百姓，特别是二十岁及以上的男子的点名。章末，我们发现有一个支派没有被包括在内，那就是利未支派。利未支派的男子被神分别出来，负责照看会幕——神百姓敬拜的地方。在我们反思这一段经文时，让我们从这一章中提取几个观察点。

首先，注意到神的百姓中，所有二十岁及以上的男子都被期望为神的百姓争战。这次的人口普查并非随机，它有一个非常明确的目的。神指示摩西去统计所有能够为神的百姓打仗的人。作为以色列社区中的一个男子，意味着要被列为为神和神的百姓争战的预备者。

其次，虽然争战很重要，但神的百姓敬拜祂才是最重要的事。若是以色列人将利未人列入战斗人员，带他们一同上阵，是否有帮助呢？当然，人数会更多！神为什么会将整整一个支派的男子——战斗人员的十分之一——分别出来，专门负责会幕的事务呢？这教导我们，神极其重视祂百姓正确而合宜的敬拜。

📖 **Passage to read**: ==Numbers 01==

> [!info]- 🎙️Audio: [A Daily Devotional - 02.18 - EN]()  

God’s promises to Abraham and his descendants are still going to come true, and God will continue to be faithful to his people, but it does seem to take a long time. If Genesis was a book about God’s blessing for his people, and Exodus was a book about God’s taking his people from slavery to worship, and Leviticus was a book about God’s law for his redeemed people, then Numbers is an “are we there yet?” kind of book. The Israelites spend the entirety of the book of Numbers in the wilderness, failing again and again to have faith in God, and yet continuing to experience God’s faithfulness and patience toward them.

Numbers 1 describes the numbering of God’s people, especially the men who were twenty years old or more. As the chapter ends, we find that one tribe is not numbered with the rest. It’s the tribe of Levi, whose men were set aside by God to handle the care of the tabernacle—the place of worship for God’s people. As we reflect on this passage, let’s make a couple of observations from this first chapter.

First, notice that all men twenty years old and older in the community of God’s people are expected to fight God’s battles for God’s people. This numbering of God’s people is not random; it is for a very specific purpose. God is instructing Moses to determine all who were able to go to war among God’s people. To be a man of God in the community of Israel meant to be counted as one who must be ready to fight for God and God’s people.

> [!important]+ Reflect and Respond
Second, notice that while fighting battles was important, the worship of God by his people is the most important thing to God. Would it have helped the Israelites to count the Levites as part of their fighting men and take them to war with them? Of course; there would have been more people! What does it teach us about God that he would set aside an entire tribe of men—one twelfth of the fighting men—to care for the place of worship? It teaches us that God places great value on the proper and right worship of him by his people.
