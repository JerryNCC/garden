### <center>十字架</center>

> [!info]- 🎙️Audio: [None]()

在路加福音第23章，我们来到整本圣经的核心——神的儿子耶稣基督的受死。整本圣经的故事都指向这一刻。路加要我们明白，十字架真正的意义是什么。

首先，路加让我们看见，耶稣作为无罪的神子，独自站在满是罪人的人群中。他被钉十字架，主要是因为犹太领袖的控告。官长讥笑他，挑战他救自己。罗马兵丁戏弄他，分取他的衣服当作战利品。甚至与他同钉的一个犯人，也加入辱骂的行列。在生命的尽头，耶稣孤单地悬挂在十字架上。

其次，路加让我们看见，十字架使罪人得以被神称为义。在路加独有的记载中，有一个与耶稣同钉的犯人转向他。他责备另一位嘲笑耶稣的犯人，然后说：“耶稣啊，你得国降临的时候，求你记念我。”（23:42）耶稣立刻回答：“我实在告诉你，今日你要同我在乐园里了。”（23:43）这人并没有一生敬虔的记录，但因着一个简单的信心，他立刻被圣洁的神赦免、接纳。

最后，路加让我们看见，罪人面对十字架唯一正确的回应，就是那位信靠的犯人所表现的：悔改、信心，并完全倚靠耶稣的恩典。他无可夸的善行，只单单信靠耶稣，就得着永远的生命。

> [!important]+ 反思与回应
让这也成为你的祷告：“耶稣啊，因着你的怜悯，因你为我的罪死在十字架上，求你记念我。”感谢神，因着祂儿子的受死，你也必有一天与祂永远同在。

📖 **Passage to read**: ==Luke 23:26-43==

> [!info]- 🎙️Audio: [None]()  

In Luke 23 we reach the heart of the whole Bible: the death of Jesus Christ, the Son of God. Everything in Scripture moves toward this moment. Luke wants us to see what the cross really means.

First, Luke shows us that Jesus stands alone as the innocent Son of God among guilty sinners. He is crucified because the Jewish leaders attack him. The rulers laugh at him and challenge him to save himself. The Roman soldiers mock him and divide his clothes like prizes. Even one of the criminals hanging beside him joins in the insults. At the end of his life, Jesus hangs on the cross abandoned and alone.

Second, Luke shows us that the cross makes it possible for guilty people to be declared right with God. Only in Luke do we read about the criminal who turns to Jesus. He rebukes the other criminal for mocking Jesus and then says, “Jesus, remember me when you come into your kingdom” (23:42). Jesus answers right away: “Truly I tell you, today you will be with me in paradise” (23:43). This man had no record of living a faithful life. Yet with one small act of faith, he is forgiven and accepted by a holy God.

Finally, Luke shows us the only right way for sinners to respond to the cross. It is the way of the believing criminal: repentance, faith, and trust in the grace of Jesus. He had no good works to offer. He simply relied on Jesus, and that was enough to gain eternal life.

> [!important]+ Reflect and Respond
Let this be your prayer: “Jesus, remember me by your mercy, because of your death on the cross for my sins.” Thank God that through the death of his Son, you too can be with him forever.
