### <center>什么是福音？</center>

> [!info]- 🎙️Audio: [None]()


今天我们常常听见“福音”这个词。我们说要_传讲_福音，要_分享_福音，要让教会的_事工_、_活动_、_团契_都以福音为中心。可是，在不断提到这个词的时候，我们有时反而忘了停下来思考一个简单的问题：**到底什么是福音？** 当我们说“福音”时，我们真正指的是什么？

保罗在《哥林多前书》十五章开头，就回答了这个问题。写到这里，他已经针对哥林多教会的许多问题提出了严厉的劝诫。但此刻，他停下来，再次提醒他们他当初所传的信息——那是“最重要的”福音（15:3）。这是他教导的一切核心。那这福音的内容是什么呢？

首先，保罗说，福音的信息是：**耶稣基督为我们的罪而死。**  
耶稣的死，不仅仅是一个爱的榜样或牺牲的象征，而是神拯救罪人的核心行动。神的儿子在十字架上代替我们受死，承担了我们该受的刑罚。保罗又补充说，耶稣“被埋葬了”——这说明祂真的死了。那位神人，确实为罪人献上了完全的、最终的赎罪祭。

其次，保罗宣告：**耶稣在第三天复活了**（15:4）。  
福音不仅讲述祂的死，也讲述祂的复活。通过祂的死，罪得了赦免；通过祂的复活，死亡被彻底打败。空坟墓见证了祂确实活着，也预表一切信祂的人都将与祂一同得胜，战胜罪与死。

最后，保罗在每一句陈述中都重复了一个重要短语：**“照圣经所说。”**  
也就是说，福音的一切成就，都是应验神在旧约中早已赐下的应许。福音不是另起的新故事，而是从《创世记》开始的救赎故事的延续与高潮。整本圣经都在指向这一件事——神的儿子为祂的子民死而复活，成就永远的救恩。

这就是我们因信所领受的福音——神借着祂的儿子为我们成就的救恩。  
那么，你是否把这福音看作世上最宝贵的珍宝？你是否乐意在每一个机会中与人分享这好消息？

> [!important]+ 反思与回应
祈求神保守你的心，让你对这荣耀的福音永不厌倦，常常因耶稣基督的救恩而充满惊叹、感恩与喜乐，并活出这福音的真理。

### <center>What Is the Gospel?</center>

> [!question]+ Review
> 


📖 **Passage to read**: ==1 Corinthians 15.01-11==

> [!info]- 🎙️Audio: [None]()  

We often hear people talk about the gospel. We say we should _preach_ the gospel, _share_ the gospel, and keep our _ministries_ and _programs_ gospel-centered. But sometimes, with all this talk, we forget to ask a simple question: **What is the gospel?** What are we actually talking about when we use that word?

That’s exactly what Paul explains at the beginning of 1 Corinthians 15. After addressing many issues in the Corinthian church, Paul now pauses to remind them of the central truth he first preached to them—the gospel that is “of first importance” (15:3). This is the heart of everything he taught. So what is this gospel?

First, Paul says, the gospel is the message that **Jesus Christ died for our sins.** The death of Jesus is not just an example of love or sacrifice; it is the very center of God’s plan to save sinners. On the cross, the Son of God took our place and bore the punishment we deserved. Paul adds that Jesus “was buried”—a way of saying that his death was real. He truly died. The God-man gave his life as the final and complete sacrifice for our sin.

Second, Paul declares that **Jesus was raised on the third day** (15:4). The gospel is not only about his death—it’s about his resurrection too. Through his death, sin was paid for; through his resurrection, death itself was defeated. The empty tomb tells us that Jesus lives, and that all who believe in him will share in that victory over sin and death.

Finally, Paul repeats an important phrase in these verses: “**in accordance with the Scriptures.**” In other words, everything about the gospel fulfills God’s promises throughout the Old Testament. The gospel is not a new story; it is the continuation and climax of the story that began in Genesis. Every part of Scripture points to this—God’s Son dying and rising again to bring salvation to his people.

This is the gospel we have received by faith. It is the good news of what God has done for us through his Son, Jesus Christ. So, do you treasure this gospel above everything else? Do you find joy in sharing it whenever you can?

> [!important]+ Reflect and Respond
Pray that God would keep your heart full of wonder for the good news of Jesus—so that you never grow tired of hearing it, loving it, and living it out.
