#### English Conversation:

**Emma**: Hey, Mike, can I **ask** you something?  
**Mike**: Sure, what’s up?

**Emma**: Did you hear about the kid who accidentally **broke** his **desk** yesterday?  
**Mike**: Yeah, I heard he was running down the **stairs** and tripped. Poor guy!

**Emma**: I know! The teacher told him to **stay** in his **seat** next time and not run around.  
**Mike**: Makes sense. It’s not safe to run inside, especially near the **stairs**.

**Emma**: True. I hope he’ll **understand** the importance of being careful.  
**Mike**: Me too. By the way, have you noticed how much taller he’s gotten this **year**?

**Emma**: Oh, definitely! He looks so different now. Anyway, let’s **walk** to the cafeteria. I need a break from all this studying.  
**Mike**: Good idea. We can **talk** about the project on the way.

**迈克**：当然，什么事？

**艾玛**：你听说昨天那个小孩不小心**打破**了他的**书桌**的事了吗？

**迈克**：我也是。对了，你有没有注意到他今年**长**高了多少？
