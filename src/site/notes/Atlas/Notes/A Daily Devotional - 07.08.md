### <center>我的帮助从造天地的耶和华而来</center>

> [!info]- 🎙️Audio: [A Daily Devotional - 07.08 - CN]()


当我们不断阅读圣经、更加明白其中的话语时，我们也就更清楚地认识这位伟大的上帝。祂是掌权者，是托住万有的主，是安慰者，也是护卫者。然而，在诗篇一百二十一篇中，诗人特别强调上帝的一个属性：祂是我们的保护者。

这篇诗篇是“上行之诗”中的第一首。这组诗篇极有可能是在以色列人上耶路撒冷敬拜时所唱的。当我们想到以色列的地势，诗篇开头的描写就显得格外贴切：“我要向山举目”（诗121:1）。在此，诗人似乎正处在一种惶恐不安的情绪中，他问道：“我的帮助从何而来？”他或许曾在试探中想转向山上的偶像求助，或许这不过是表达他在困境中向上仰望，渴望援手。无论如何，答案很快就出现了——真正的帮助只从耶和华而来。

诗人宣告：“我的帮助从造天地的耶和华而来。”（诗121:2）这句话提醒我们，我们所依靠的，不是其他受造之物，而是创造万有的主宰。接下来，整首诗反复强调上帝为祂子民所做的一件事：保护。他用了六次“保护”（keep）这个动词，只在短短八节的诗篇中，显然是要我们牢牢记住这件事：上帝看顾我们、保守我们、与我们同在。

上帝不打盹，也不睡觉。祂的眼目时常看顾祂的子民，不分昼夜。祂保守我们脱离患难，也护卫我们远离罪恶。而这份看顾，不是暂时的，而是永恒的：“耶和华要保护你出你入，从今时直到永远。”（诗121:8）

这是我们当日以为乐的真理。上帝不仅藉着耶稣基督救赎了我们，更持续保守我们，直到最后。祂紧紧握住那些属于祂的人，不放手。

> [!important]+ 反思与回应
所以，今天你可以来到祂面前祷告。感谢祂是你的保护者，感谢祂保守你的心灵、看顾你的道路。祈求祂使你远离试探，脱离罪恶，并赐你力量继续忠心。最重要的是，求祂常常提醒你，在困境中不要转向别处，只单单仰望祂。

### <center>My Help Comes from the Lord</center>

> [!question]+ Review
> 1. ⁠How does the psalmist describe the “blessed” person in Psalm 119? What is their relationship with God’s word?
> 2. Why does the psalmist stress the importance of “storing up God’s word in the heart”? How does this help guard against sin?
> 3. In today’s world full of temptations, how can you live a pure life? What role does God’s word play in helping you do so?

📖 **Passage to read**: ==Psalm 121==

> [!info]- 🎙️Audio: [A Daily Devotional - 07.08 - EN]()  

As we keep reading the Bible and getting to know it better, we begin to see more clearly who God is. He rules over everything. He holds the world together. He comforts his people and protects them. But in Psalm 121, the writer focuses on one particular truth about God: he is our keeper.

Psalm 121 is the first in a group called the “Songs of Ascents.” These were most likely sung by God’s people as they traveled up to Jerusalem to worship. If you think about the land of Israel, it makes sense that the psalm starts by looking at the hills: “I lift up my eyes to the hills” (v. 1). The writer seems to be in a moment of fear or uncertainty, and he asks, “From where does my help come?” Maybe he’s tempted to look to the hills where idols were worshiped. Or maybe he’s simply looking upward, searching for help. Either way, the answer comes quickly and clearly: help comes from the Lord.

The psalmist says, “My help comes from the Lord, who made heaven and earth” (v. 2). That one sentence reminds us who we’re dealing with—this is the Creator of all things. And what does he do for his people? He keeps them. That word “keep” shows up again and again—six times in just eight verses. It’s clear the psalmist really wants us to know that God watches over us, protects us, and stays with us.

God never sleeps. He never loses focus. He’s always watching over his people, day and night. He guards us from harm. He keeps us from sin. And best of all, his care doesn’t end. “The Lord will keep your going out and your coming in from this time forth and forevermore” (v. 8). He’s with us in every season, every moment.

> [!important]+ Reflect and Respond
That’s something worth celebrating. God didn’t just save us through Jesus; he keeps us. He holds on to the ones he’s saved. So take time today to pray. Thank him for being your keeper. Thank him for protecting your heart and soul. Ask him to guard you from sin and keep you faithful. And most of all, ask him to help you keep looking to him, and not anywhere else, when times are hard.
