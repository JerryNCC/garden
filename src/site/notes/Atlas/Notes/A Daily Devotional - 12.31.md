### <center>福音</center>

> [!info]- 🎙️Audio: [None]()


作为总结，我们要来看三处关键经文，它们提醒我们整本圣经故事的核心信息：**福音**。  
我们将看到**所应许的福音**（创 3:14–15），**被阐明的福音**（林前 15:1–4），以及**耶稣呼召我们去宣讲福音**（太 28:16–20）。

#### 创世记 3:14–15

创世记的这段经文提醒我们：福音并不是神计划中的事后补救，不是什么附带的安排，也不是神为祂那犯罪、顽梗的子民所预备的“B 计划”。**福音从一开始就是神拯救失丧之人的计划。**  
令人何等惊叹的是，即使在创世记第三章——在人类历史中最黑暗、最低谷的时刻——我们就在圣经中听见了福音的第一个应许。亚当和夏娃刚刚公然违背神的话语，反叛祂的统治；他们吃了禁果，拒绝神作他们的王。从那一刻起，神完全有理由结束人类的历史，把他们弃之不顾，重新开始。然而，神并没有这样做。祂在惩罚罪的同时，仍然作出应许。祂指向遥远的将来，说将有一个出于夏娃的后裔要伤蛇的头，并且要对罪取得完全而最终的胜利。

这个神的应许，常被称为 _protoevangelium_（“原始福音”或“第一福音”），帮助我们理解从创世记直到福音书整部圣经的宏大戏剧。这一切并非偶然！神以主权的方式，为实现祂最初向子民所作的福音应许铺设道路。事实上，整本圣经的故事都奔向一个终极的高峰——所有神应许在耶稣基督里完全实现：祂的道成肉身、代赎性的死亡，以及荣耀的复活。朋友，请记得你所事奉、所敬拜的是怎样的一位神！祂是在全人类最黑暗的时刻，应许生命、赦免与救恩的神；而这一切，最终是以祂儿子的生命为代价成就的。何等奇妙、恩典、拯救人的神！

请你回想伊甸园中堕落之后的那一天，感受亚当和夏娃在拒绝神完美统治之后所经历的羞愧、内疚与破碎；然后记得我们的神当时所赐下的福音应许——一个关于最终得胜与救恩的应许，要藉着亚当和夏娃的后裔来成就。感谢神赐下耶稣，成全了这伟大的福音应许！

#### 哥林多前书 15:1–4

哥林多前书的这段经文，总结了那早已被应许之福音的实质内容。可以说，这里是**对福音的清楚说明**。因此，如果有一天有人问你：“什么是福音？”你完全可以带他或她来到这段经文。那这段经文是如何向我们解释福音的呢？

首先，它告诉我们：**福音关乎耶稣代赎性的死亡。**  
保罗在提醒哥林多人福音时，称之为“最重要的事”，并写道：“基督照着圣经所说，为我们的罪死了”（15:3）。我们必须牢记这一点！任何对福音的描述，若不包括耶稣为我们的罪而死，都还没有真正说到重点。福音告诉我们，耶稣的死如何最终解决了神子民的罪——那是为罪所献上的牺牲性死亡。最重要的是，耶稣的十字架成就了赎罪；祂为一切真实悔改、信靠祂为救主和主的神子民，担当了罪的刑罚。

其次，这段经文告诉我们：**福音也关乎耶稣从死里复活。**  
祂在十字架上的死付清了我们罪的代价，而祂的复活则为祂所有的子民永远战胜了死亡。福音既是关于耶稣的死，也是关于祂从死里复活。耶稣并没有停留在死亡之中；祂的复活是神证明十字架上的工作已被悦纳、并且对失丧的罪人真实有效。基督徒所事奉、所跟随的是一位复活的救主和主；他们对永生的盼望，根植于祂的复活之中。

最后，这段经文告诉我们：**福音也扎根于神的话语。**  
你是否注意到，在保罗总结福音的每一个要点之后，都重复出现的一句话？那就是：“照着圣经所说。”保罗要清楚表明——关于福音的一切，都与神的话语完全一致，成就了神对祂子民的所有应许。基督为罪而死、从死里复活，正是神话语的应验——包括伊甸园中那最初的福音应许。

感谢神赐下这福音！感谢祂将这好消息赐给我们：耶稣为你的罪死了，并从死里复活，确保你将来的复活和永生。求神帮助你用尽全力持守这福音，因为它是**最重要的事**！

---

#### 马太福音 28:16–20

最后，我们来看耶稣升天之前对门徒所说的最后一段话。这些话——毫无疑问是极其著名的——呼召所有跟随耶稣基督的人，在各处为福音作见证。

耶稣的呼召非常清楚：祂的门徒要往各处去，教导他们从祂那里所领受的一切。这福音——早在很久以前就由神应许，并在耶稣基督的位格中荣耀地实现——是给全世界的好消息，是必须被传扬的！接着，耶稣更进一步。祂的门徒不只是要传讲好消息，更是要使相信的人作门徒。朋友，凡是相信福音的人，也应当去分享并教导这福音；他们要倍增，要把关于耶稣的好消息传到各地！

在你完成这一年的圣经阅读之际，我把这个挑战留给你：**如果你真的相信圣经所宣告的福音，就勇敢地去分享它！**告诉别人关于耶稣的事。成为你救主真正的门徒，并开始带领别人作门徒。圣经是神拯救的伟大故事，而这是一个必须传给全世界的故事！

> [!important]+ 反思与回应 
感谢神赐下祂荣耀的话语。感谢祂是一位向子民说话的神——使祂救恩的信息对我们是可知、可明白的。求祂使你成为福音的见证人，使别人因着你的生命而认识耶稣！

📖 **Passage to read**: ==3 passages==

> [!info]- 🎙️Audio: [None]()  

**The Gospel**

To conclude, we are going to look at three key passages that remind us of the central message of the Bible story: the gospel. We will look at the gospel _promised_ (Gen. 3:14–15). We will see the gospel _explained_ (1 Cor. 15:1–4). And we will see Jesus’s call to all of us for the gospel to be _proclaimed_ (Matt. 28:16–20).

GENESIS 3:14–15

The Genesis passage reminds us that the gospel was not an afterthought in God’s plan, some kind of sideshow endeavor, or a plan B for his sinful, stubborn people. The gospel was God’s plan for saving lost people from the very beginning. How amazing is it that even in Genesis 3, at the darkest and lowest point of human history, we hear the first promise of the gospel in Scripture. Adam and Eve have just blatantly disregarded God’s word and rebelled against his rule. They both ate the forbidden fruit and rejected God as their King. God would have been completely justified in being _done_ with humanity at this point—in throwing them away and starting over. But God didn’t do that. He made a promise, even as he punished sin. He pointed far into the future when a human seed of Eve would bruise the head of Satan and have complete and final victory over sin.

This promise of God, often called the _protoevangelium_ (or “first gospel”) gives us a way to understand the entire drama of the Bible from Genesis to the Gospels. The events are not random! God is sovereignly laying the groundwork for the fulfillment of this first gospel promise that he made to his people. In fact, the whole story of the Bible is rushing forward to the ultimate culmination of all God’s promises in Jesus Christ—his incarnation, sacrificial death, and glorious resurrection from the dead. Friend, remember the kind of God you serve and worship! He is the God who—at the darkest moment for humanity—made a promise of life, forgiveness, and salvation, which would cost his Son his very life. What an amazing, gracious, saving God!

_Think back to that day in the garden of Eden, after the fall. Feel the shame, guilt, and devastation of Adam and Eve after their rejection of God’s perfect rule. Then remember the gospel promise that our God made, even back then: a promise of final victory and salvation that would be achieved by the seed of Adam and Eve. Thank God for Jesus, who fulfills this great gospel promise!_

1 CORINTHIANS 15:1–4

The 1 Corinthians passage summarizes the substance of the gospel, which was promised long before. It is, really, the gospel _explained_. So if someone asks you at some point, “What is the gospel?” you can take him or her to this passage. How does this passage explain the gospel to us?

First, it tells us that the gospel is about Jesus’s sacrificial death. Paul begins by reminding the Corinthians about the gospel—the things “of first importance”—when he writes: “That Christ died for our sins” (15:3). We need to remember this! Any description of the gospel that does not include Jesus’s death for our sins hasn’t done the job. The gospel tells us how Jesus’s death dealt finally with the sin of God’s people—a sacrificial death _for_ sin. Above all, this is what the cross of Jesus accomplishes; Jesus makes atonement for the sins of all God’s true people, who will repent of sin and trust in him as Savior and Lord.

Second, this passage tells us that the gospel is about Jesus’s resurrection from the dead. His death on the cross paid the price for our sins, but it was his resurrection that conquered death forever for all his people. The gospel is about Jesus’s death _and_ his resurrection from the dead. Jesus doesn’t stay dead; his resurrection is God’s proof that this work on the cross was acceptable and effective for lost sinners. Christians serve and follow a risen Savior and Lord; their hope for eternal life is anchored in his resurrection!

Finally, this passage tells us that the gospel is also anchored in God’s word. Did you notice the phrase that is repeated after each part of Paul’s gospel summary? It’s the phrase, “in accordance with the Scriptures.” Paul wants to be clear—everything about the gospel is _in line_ with God’s word and all his promises to his people. Christ’s death for sin and his resurrection from the dead fulfill God’s word—including that first gospel promise in the garden of Eden!

_Thank God for this gospel! Thank him for the good news that Jesus died for your sin and rose from the dead to secure your resurrection and eternal life. Ask God to help you hold on to this gospel with all your strength. It is of first importance!_

MATTHEW 28:16–20

We will end with the final words that Jesus spoke to his disciples before his ascension. These words—famous ones, to say the least—call _all_ followers of Jesus Christ to bear witness to the gospel everywhere!

The call from Jesus is clear; his disciples are to go everywhere and teach everything that they have learned from him. This gospel—promised by God long ago and delivered gloriously in the person of Jesus Christ—is good news for all the world. It is meant to be shared! Then Jesus goes even further. His disciples are not just to preach the good news; they are to make disciples of people who believe. Friend, people who _believe_ the gospel are to _share and teach_ the gospel. They are to multiply and to spread the good news of Jesus everywhere!

As you end this year of Bible reading, I leave you with this challenge: if you truly believe the gospel that the Bible proclaims, share it boldly! Tell others about Jesus. Become a true disciple of your Savior and begin making disciples of others. The Bible is the great story of God’s salvation, and it is a story that must be shared with the world!

> [!important]+ Reflect and Respond
_Thank God for his glorious word. Thank him that he is a God who speaks to his people—who makes the news of his salvation accessible and understandable to us. Ask him to make you a witness to the gospel, so that others will know Jesus because of your life!_
