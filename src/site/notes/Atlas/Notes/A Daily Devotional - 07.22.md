### <center>爱情与婚姻</center>

> [!info]- 🎙️Audio: [A Daily Devotional - 07.22 - CN]()


在整本圣经中，最常被人避而不谈的书卷之一，莫过于《雅歌》。无论在讲台上，还是查经小组中，人们往往对这卷书感到尴尬。其中一个原因，是它直白地描写身体与爱情，这对青少年甚至成年人而言，往往令人不自在。历史上，教会长久以来将《雅歌》解释为基督与教会之间爱的寓言。毕竟，很难想象圣经中如此炽热的言语竟是描写人类之间的爱情！

然而，虽然圣经的确常以婚姻象征基督与教会之间的关系，但《雅歌》的主要目的，并不是要作寓言式的描绘。这卷书本就是一首关于婚姻之爱的人间情诗。它热烈地颂扬男女之间在婚约之中、由造物主设立的爱情、浪漫与亲密。所罗门王（或与他关系密切的人）写下这首诗歌，为要表达婚姻中爱情之美，宣扬神原初设立婚姻所赐下的美好。

这卷书的第一章就是一幅爱情的画面，有多位角色登场。开篇是女子的倾诉：“愿他用口与我亲嘴！因为你的爱情比酒更美。”（雅歌 1:2）她毫不隐藏自己对所爱的倾慕，倾心而发。她的闺中朋友也加入赞美，说：“我们要称赞你的爱情，胜过称赞美酒。”（雅歌 1:4）随后男子也回应她的爱意，称她为“女子中极美丽的”（1:8），又再次说：“我的佳偶，你甚美丽，你甚美丽。”（1:15）在这一章中，我们看到一对彼此相爱的恋人，也看到周围朋友为他们的爱情而欢喜。

这章经文为我们展现出上帝对人类爱情与婚姻的美好设计。这不是羞耻之事，也不是人要避讳的事，而是神亲自所赐的美善。爱情、吸引、浪漫，皆出于神的手，是他为人类所预备的恩典，应当在婚姻中被珍惜、被喜乐地活出来。

> [!important]+ 反思与回应
所以，当你读这卷书的时候，不妨祈求上帝塑造你对爱情与婚姻的看法。求他启示你明白他对婚姻的心意，并引导你在未来作出合他心意的选择。爱情与婚姻本是出于神的恩赐，我们若以感恩的心来领受，在其中敬拜祂，也就荣耀了祂的名。

📖 **Passage to read**: ==Songs of Solomon 01==

> [!info]- 🎙️Audio: [A Daily Devotional - 07.22 - EN]()  


If there’s one book in the Bible that makes many people feel awkward, it’s the Song of Solomon. It’s not often preached on in church, and it rarely comes up in Bible study groups. One reason is that it talks openly about parts of the body, and for both teens and adults, that can be uncomfortable. For a long time, many in the church explained the book as a picture of Christ’s love for the church. They just couldn’t imagine that this kind of passionate language could be about a man and a woman in love.

But while marriage does picture Christ and the church in many places in Scripture, the Song of Solomon wasn’t mainly written to be an allegory. It really is a poem about romantic love in marriage. It’s a joyful, lively celebration of human love the way God intended it to be. Solomon—or someone close to him—wrote this beautiful poem to show the goodness of love, romance, and physical affection in the context of marriage.

The book opens with a love scene. The woman speaks first. She says, “Let him kiss me with the kisses of his mouth! For your love is better than wine” (1:2). She’s not shy. She’s in love and wants to express it. Her friends back her up and join in her joy: “We will extol your love more than wine” (1:4). Then the man speaks. He praises her, calling her the most beautiful among women (1:8). He says again, “You are beautiful, my love” (1:15). This chapter shows us a couple in love—and their community rejoicing with them.

This first chapter shows us what God wants for human love and marriage. It’s not something to hide from or be embarrassed about. It’s a good thing, a gift. Love, attraction, and romance are all given by God. They are meant to be enjoyed, protected, and lived out in marriage.

> [!important]+ Reflect and Respond
So, as you read this book, ask God to shape your thoughts about love and marriage. Ask him to help you see what he wants marriage to be, and pray that he will lead you as you think about your future. Love and marriage are his gifts, and when we receive them with thanksgiving, we worship him even through them.
