#### SCM Question 4
You have received an email from your friend, Amir, who has just taken part in a school camp.

Hi [Your Name],

Guess what? I just got back from the school leadership camp! It was held in the jungle, and we had to cook our own food and sleep in tents. I even led a team-building game and got praised by the teacher!
Have you ever joined a school camp before? Maybe next time you can come along with me. It’ll be fun!

Take care,
Amir

Write an email to your friend in about 80 words.

In your email, you should:
 respond to his news and say you are proud of him
 share whether you have ever joined a camp before
 show interest in joining the next camp with him

#### First Draft

Hi Amir,

It's great to hear from you. A school leadership camp in a jungle? That must be a really thrilling experience for you! I was happy to know that you had led a team building game well. Your team must have a better bonding right now.

I did join a school camp before, but due to heavy rain, we were forced to stop the camp prematurely. It was really kesian. I would really love to join your school camp along with you if I was given a chance. 

Tell me more about your camp.

Your friend
Jerry
