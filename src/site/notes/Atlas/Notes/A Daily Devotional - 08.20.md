《但以理书》第二章以一场危机开始。巴比伦王尼布甲尼撒因梦境而心中烦乱，迫切想知道其中的意义。但他并没有只要求解梦，而是命令术士和哲士们必须先把梦的内容说出来，再加以解释。这是人所不能的任务，哲士们也坦言无能为力。王大大震怒，下令将全国所有的哲士杀尽——其中也包括但以理和他的朋友们。

这时，但以理站出来，靠着神所赐的智慧，成就了无人能行之事。他既将梦的内容说出来，也将其含义解释清楚。那梦揭示了地上列国的兴衰更替，却也指向最终的结局——神永远的国必然建立，直到永远。故事最后，但以理因着这事蒙恩，被立在王宫中高位，一时局势得以转圜。

但请注意经文中的两句话——一句出自但以理，一句出自尼布甲尼撒。首先，但以理在王面前这样宣告：“哲士、用法术的、观兆的、术士，都不能把王所问的奥秘指给王知道；只有一位在天上的神能显明奥秘的事，他已将日后必有的事指示尼布甲尼撒王”（2:27–28）。但以理毫不居功，将一切荣耀归于神。

其次，看看尼布甲尼撒在梦被揭示之后的回应。这位权势显赫的君王，竟俯伏在地，说：“你们的神诚然是万神之神，万王之主，又是显明奥秘事的，因为你能将这奥秘的事显明出来”（2:47）。一个曾经依靠偶像和术士的外邦君王，此刻亲口承认以色列的神为至大。神在当时如此行，如今仍然如此行——祂愿意使用祂的子民，将祂的荣耀彰显出来，使人归向祂，颂赞祂。

> [!important]+ 反思与回应
让我们祷告，求神赐我们同样的心志——无论言语或生活，都能让人看见祂的伟大。祂满有恩典、慈爱、真理、权能与美善。既然我们认识祂，就当切切盼望别人也能认识祂。

> [!question]+ Review
> 1.⁠ ⁠In the midst of exile, what dangers did Daniel and his friends face?
2.⁠ ⁠Why did Daniel resolve not to defile himself with the king’s food and wine?
3.⁠ ⁠How does this chapter show God’s presence and care, even when His people were far away in Babylon?

📖 **Passage to read**: ==Daniel 02==

> [!info]- 🎙️Audio: [None]()  

Daniel 2 opens with a crisis. King Nebuchadnezzar is deeply disturbed by a dream, and he is desperate to know what it means. But instead of just asking for an interpretation, he demands that his magicians and wise men first tell him what the dream was. That’s an impossible task, and the wise men admit it. The king, furious, orders that all the wise men in Babylon be executed—including Daniel and his friends.

Daniel steps forward and, by the wisdom God gives him, does what no one else can. He tells the king both the content of the dream and its meaning. The dream shows the rise and fall of kingdoms on earth, but also the final victory of God’s eternal kingdom. By the end of the story, Daniel is honored with a high position in the king’s court. For the moment, things end well.

But notice two important words—one from Daniel and one from Nebuchadnezzar. First, Daniel tells the king: “No wise men, enchanters, magicians, or astrologers can show to the king the mystery that the king has asked, but there is a God in heaven who reveals mysteries, and he has made known to King Nebuchadnezzar what will be in the latter days” (2:27–28). Even here, Daniel gives all credit and glory to God.

Second, look at Nebuchadnezzar’s response after hearing his dream revealed. This powerful king falls on his face and says, “Truly, your God is God of gods and Lord of kings, and a revealer of mysteries, for you have been able to reveal this mystery” (2:47). A pagan king, who once looked to idols and magicians, now confesses the greatness of Israel’s God. This is what God does—then and now. He uses his people to display his glory and to bring others to praise him.

> [!important]+ Reflect and Respond
Pray that God would give you the same heart—to live and speak in such a way that others come to know his greatness. He is full of grace, love, truth, power, and goodness. If we know him, we should long for others to know him too.
