### <center>被逐出应许之地</center>

> [!info]- 🎙️Audio: [A Daily Devotional - 05.25 - CN]()

我们早已预料到这一天的到来——审判。长久以来，这个警告反复被提及。而如今，在这段经文中，它终于应验了。神的子民被掳到外邦，被赶出神所赐予他们的土地。就像神在说：“你们若不愿顺服我的统治，就不能继续住在我的地上。”

对于北国以色列来说，这场审判是借着亚述人临到的。亚述人是残暴的民族，军力强盛。他们征服了以色列，把神的百姓掳去异地。他们远离家园，成了外邦的奴仆与仆人。因着罪，以色列人成了无家可归之民。

但作者没有让我们忘记这一切的原因。其实，这正是以色列人自招的。在《列王纪下》17章7节中我们读到：“这事临到，是因为以色列人得罪那领他们从埃及地出来的耶和华他们的神。”他们背弃了那位曾救他们脱离奴役、赐给他们土地、建立他们为大国的神。他们不再爱他、顺服他，只是随从列国的风俗，去敬拜虚假的神明，陷入各样的恶行。

作者罗列了他们诸般的罪行，最后又指出一件事：神的警告。这场审判并非毫无预兆。神一次又一次差遣先知传达他的话语。先知们不断呼喊：“你们要离开恶道，遵行我的诫命和律例”（17:13）。但百姓始终不肯听从。他们无视神的声音。最终，以色列被掳，只剩下南国犹大仍勉强存在。

但犹大也逃不了。经文继续说：“犹大人也不遵守耶和华他们神的诫命”（17:19）。以色列先遭审判，但犹大的日子也近了。他们同样背弃了神，审判也终将临到他们。

然而，故事并没有以绝望结束。我们感谢神，他没有永远将他的子民撇弃在流亡中。最终，他差遣自己的儿子来到世上。耶稣来，是要救我们脱离更深的流放——那因罪所带来的死亡与隔绝。借着他，我们可以回归神的家中。

愿你今天花时间向神认罪祈求，求他因着耶稣基督的救恩，赦免你、赐你恩典。

### <center>Carried Out of the Land</center>

> [!question]+ Review
> 1. King Jeroboam II is described as doing "evil in the eyes of the Lord," yet God allowed him to restore Israel’s boundaries. Why would God permit this?
> 2. The passage says the Israelites were “suffering bitterly.” What does this reveal about God's character in the midst of judgment and discipline?
> 3. his reading shows that God preserves a faithful remnant even during judgment. How do you understand the balance between God's justice and His mercy?

📖 **Passage to read**: ==2 Kings 17:06-23==

> [!info]- 🎙️Audio: [A Daily Devotional - 05.25 - EN]()  

We knew this was coming. We’ve been hearing about it for a long time—judgment. And now, in this passage, it finally happens. God’s people are taken into exile. They’re removed from the land God gave them. It’s as if God is saying, “If you will not live under my rule, then you cannot stay in my land.”

For Israel, the northern kingdom, this judgment comes through the Assyrians. These were cruel people with a powerful army. They defeat Israel and take the people away. Now God’s people are in a foreign land, far from home, living as servants. Their sin has made them a people without a land.

But in case we’ve forgotten why this is happening, the writer reminds us. Israel has brought this on themselves. In 2 Kings, we’re told that “they had sinned against the LORD their God, who had brought them up out of the land of Egypt” (17:7). They turned away from the God who had rescued them, given them a home, and made them his own people. Instead of loving and obeying him, they followed the nations around them. They bowed down to false gods. They did what was evil in God’s eyes.

The writer gives us a long list of their sins. And then he points to one more thing: God’s warnings. This judgment didn’t come without warning. Again and again, God sent prophets to speak his word. Again and again, he called out: “Turn from your evil ways and keep my commandments and my statutes” (17:13). But the people refused to listen. They ignored his voice. And so, Israel is taken into exile. Only Judah remains.

But Judah won’t escape either. The writer says, “Judah also did not keep the commandments of the LORD their God” (17:19). Israel goes into exile first, but Judah’s turn is coming. They too have turned away from God. And they too will face judgment.

Still, there is hope. We thank God that he didn’t leave his people in exile forever. In time, he sent his own Son. Jesus came to rescue us from a far worse exile—the exile of sin and death. Because of him, we can be brought back home to God.
