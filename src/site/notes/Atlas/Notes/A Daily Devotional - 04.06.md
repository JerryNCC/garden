### <center>全世界的神</center>

> [!info]- 🎙️Audio: [A Daily Devotional - 04.06 - CN]()

当非利士人在战斗中击败以色列人时，他们夺走了约柜，并将它放置在他们的庙宇中，与他们的神大衮一起。眼看他们不仅击败了以色列人，还击败了以色列的神，他们认为神的存在将与他们的胜利之神大衮共存。

然而，神有着不同的计划。即便约柜并非神居住的地方，它依然与以色列的真神——全世界的神——紧密相连。非利士人犯了一个大错误，认为神只在以色列有能力，并且能够被他们的神大衮所控制。第一次，当约柜被放在大衮旁边的早晨，非利士人发现大衮面朝下倒在地上，几乎像是在向约柜敬拜。他们把大衮扶起来，放回原位。但第二天早晨，更糟糕的事情发生了：大衮又一次倒下，这次他的头和双手都被折断。更可怕的是，非利士人因约柜的存在，遭遇了可怕的肿瘤瘟疫，百姓痛苦不堪。无论他们将约柜转移到哪个城市，这一切依然持续发生。

通过这一切，神正在教训非利士人：祂绝不会与任何所谓的神分享祂的荣耀。神不会与大衮分享祂的空间！祂要求独占祂的空间；祂是宇宙唯一的真神。与此同时，神也在向祂的百姓显示：祂不需要他们为祂打仗。神不需要在以色列之地来彰显祂对其他神明和国家的权能，祂也不需要以色列人的帮助来迫使非利士人屈服。神自己为自己打仗；祂不需要我们！然而，更重要的是，神也在向祂的百姓表明，祂并未抛弃他们。虽然祂因他们的罪责罚他们，但祂绝不会让敌人战胜祂或祂的百姓。

> [!important]+ 反思与回应
记住，创造你、爱你、拯救你的神，是那位绝不会与其他神明在你生命中分享祂的位置的神。祂要求你敬拜祂，忠诚于祂——全心全意！祈求神帮助你将自己完全交给祂，不让任何偶像代替祂的地位。

### <center>The God of the Entire World</center>

> [!question]+ Review
> 1.  Why did the Israelites wrongly believe that bringing the ark to battle would lead to victory in 1 Samuel 4? Why did they misuse the ark for their own purposes?
> 2. ⁠How does God teach the Israelites about His holiness and justice through the way the Philistines treat the ark of the covenant?
> 3. ⁠How can we ensure that we do not use God as a tool for our own purposes? What actions can we take in our lives to submit to God and avoid "using" Him?

📖 **Passage to read**: ==1 Samuel 05==

> [!info]- 🎙️Audio: [A Daily Devotional - 04.06 - EN]()  

When the Philistines defeated the Israelites in battle, they took the ark of the covenant and placed it in their temple next to their god, Dagon. In their minds, they had not only defeated the Israelites but also their God. They thought that the God of Israel would now have to live with their victorious god, Dagon.

But God had a different plan. Even though the ark wasn’t where God dwelled, it was still connected to the one true God of Israel—the God of the entire world. The Philistines made a big mistake by thinking that God didn’t have power outside Israel, and that He could be subject to their god, Dagon. The first morning after the ark was placed next to Dagon, the Philistines found Dagon lying flat on his face, almost as if he was worshiping the ark. They set Dagon back in his place. But the next morning, things were even worse. Dagon was again face down, but this time, his head and hands were broken off. On top of that, a terrible plague of tumors struck the Philistines, causing great suffering. The same thing happened when they moved the ark to different cities.

Through all this, God was teaching the Philistines a powerful lesson—He will not share His glory with any so-called god. God will not share His space with Dagon! He demands His own space; He is the only true God of the universe. At the same time, God was showing His people that He doesn’t need them to fight His battles for Him. God didn’t need to be in Israel to show His power over other gods or nations, and He didn’t need the Israelites to force the Philistines to submit. God fights His own battles. He doesn’t need us! But, even more importantly, God was showing His people that He had not abandoned them. Yes, He judged them for their sin, but He would not allow His enemies to triumph over Him or His people.

> [!important]+ Reflect and Respond
Remember that the God who created you, loves you, and saved you is a God who will not share His space with other gods in your life. He demands your worship, your loyalty—your all! Pray that God would help you give Him complete control over your life and that you would not allow any idols to take His place.
