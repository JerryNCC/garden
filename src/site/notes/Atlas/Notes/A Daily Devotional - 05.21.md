### <center>从永恒的视角看</center>

> [!info]- 🎙️Audio: [A Daily Devotional - 05.21 - CN]()

在这段经文中，我们得以窥见一个看似令人无法承受的情境背后的真相。神为以利沙的仆人打开了眼睛，揭示了更广阔的图景，向他展示了事情的真相。这种视角的转变，使一切都发生了改变。

故事开始时，以色列与叙利亚再次陷入战争。叙利亚王非常沮丧，因为以色列军队似乎总能预知他的每一个动作。起初，他以为自己阵营里有内鬼。但最终，他得知是神的先知以利沙在向以色列王透露叙利亚军队的计划。于是，叙利亚王决定采取行动，派出全军去捉拿以利沙。

想象一下，你正在家中熟睡，突然被一阵声响惊醒，发现自己已经被一支庞大的军队包围，敌人只为了一个目的——捉拿你。这正是以利沙和他的仆人所经历的。叙利亚的军队围住了他们所在的城池，仆人看着这支军队，心中充满恐惧，知道自己和主人即将面临死亡。然而，以利沙却显得十分镇定。他对仆人说：“与我们同在的，比与他们同在的更多”（6:16）。尽管仆人依然心生恐惧，以利沙仍然祈求神为仆人打开眼睛，使他看到事情的真实面貌。当仆人再一次看时，他看到了神强大而隐形的力量——四周是烈火中的战车和马匹。以利沙和他的仆人一点也不被敌人压倒。

以利沙的仆人需要换一个角度来看待眼前的局面。他需要学会用神的眼光来看待一切，用永恒的视角来看待困境。神宽容地让他看到了那些隐藏的真理，那些虽看不见，但始终存在的神的掌权。

> [!important]+ 反思与回应
就像以利沙的仆人一样，我们也常常因眼前看似无望的情况而感到害怕和沮丧。我们忘记了神始终在工作——他始终在幕后积极行动。今天花点时间去记住这个真理。祈求神帮助你信靠他，赐下平安，保护你心怀意念，借着我们的救主耶稣基督。

### <center>Seeing with an Eternal Perspective</center>

> [!question]+ Review
> 1. ⁠In 2 Kings 5, God heals Naaman. What does this reveal about God's care for the Gentiles?
> 2. Why does Naaman declare, "There is no God in all the earth but in Israel" after his healing? What theological significance does this statement carry?
> 3. How does God’s global mission, as shown in this passage, influence our view of different nations and peoples? How do you understand that God’s salvation is not limited to the Israelites?

📖 **Passage to read**: ==2 Kings 06.08-23==

> [!info]- 🎙️Audio: [A Daily Devotional - 05.21 - EN]()  

In this passage, we are given a glimpse behind the scenes of a situation that seems overwhelming. God opens the eyes of Elisha's servant, revealing the bigger picture and showing him what is really going on. This shift in perspective makes all the difference.

The story starts with Israel and Syria at war once again. The king of Syria is frustrated because the Israelite army seems to always know his every move. At first, he thinks there’s a spy among his ranks. But then, he learns that Elisha, the prophet of God, is the one revealing the plans of the Syrian army to the king of Israel. So, the king of Syria decides to take action. He sends his entire army to capture Elisha.

Imagine waking up to find your house surrounded by a vast army, all focused on capturing you. This is what happens to Elisha and his servant. The Syrian army surrounds the city where they are, and Elisha’s servant sees the army, filled with dread, knowing that death is near. Elisha, however, remains calm. He tells his servant, “Those who are with us are more than those who are with them” (6:16). Even though his servant still feels afraid, Elisha prays for God to open his eyes so he can see things from the right perspective. When the servant looks again, he sees God's powerful, invisible forces surrounding them—chariots of fire, and horses everywhere. Elisha and his servant are not outnumbered at all.

Elisha's servant needed to see things differently. He needed to learn to view the situation through God’s eyes, with an eternal perspective. God graciously allows him to see the hidden truths, the unseen forces of God’s control that were always there, even when they couldn’t be seen.

> [!important]+ Reflect and Respond
Just like Elisha’s servant, we often feel intimidated or fearful because we can only see the immediate, hopeless situations around us. We forget that God is always at work, always active behind the scenes. Take time today to remember this truth. Pray that God will help you trust in Him, giving you peace and guarding your heart and mind in Christ Jesus, your Savior.
