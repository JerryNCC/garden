### <center>腐败的领袖</center>

> [!info]- 🎙️Audio: [A Daily Devotional - 04.03 - CN]()

在教会中，领导的腐败可能是最让人震惊和痛心的地方。我们的牧师和属灵领袖应该是具有敬虔、正直、品格和谦卑的男人。遗憾的是，祭司以利的两个儿子也是属灵领袖，但他们却是腐败的典型代表，这种腐败贯穿各个层面。这些祭司已经彻底腐化，神不再容忍这种情况。

那么，以利的儿子哈弗尼和非尼哈斯的行为到底有什么问题呢？首先，他们违背了神关于祭司如何为百姓献祭的指示。神曾为祭司规定了从带给他们的动物祭品中取食物的方式，但这有非常具体的规定。祭司只能从动物的胸部和右大腿部位取肉。然而，这些祭司做了什么呢？他们用三叉叉子从滚烫的锅中插取任何肉块，意味着他们不仅取了应得的部分，而且还拿了更多的肉。哈弗尼和非尼哈斯在敬拜的过程中，竟然在神的祭物中偷窃，严重滥用了百姓为神所献的祭物。此外，他们还与在会幕门口服侍的妇女发生了关系（2:22）。

设想一下，如果你是当时的以色列人，你带着祭物来到敬拜，准备根据神的律法为你的罪献上祭品。然而，当你来到祭坛时，祭司却拿走了超过应得的部分，你甚至无法将完整的祭品奉献给神！你会发现你本应信赖的中保——这个应该在神与你之间代求的祭司，竟然是腐化、肮脏、不配担任祭司职分的人。你会开始想：“这个无用的祭司真的能为我在神面前代求吗？”这段经文告诉我们，神的子民需要一位忠信的祭司。在这段描述腐败领袖的悲惨故事中，我们却看到了一个鲜明的对比：“那时，孩童撒母耳渐渐长大，见神和人都喜悦他”（2:26）。忠信的祭司即将来临。

> [!important]+ 反思与回应
如果你身处属灵领导的位置，无论是在小组中还是在朋友之间，祈求神帮助你明智地运用这个位置。在你祈祷时，记住你有一位完美的中保——耶稣，那个终极的祭司。你可以通过祂为你所做的事工获得赦免。

### <center>Corrupt Leaders</center>

> [!question]+ Review
> 1. ⁠Why are Hannah’s prayers and vow so significant in the story of Samuel’s birth? What lessons can we draw from this for our own faith journey today?
> 2. What roles did Samuel play in God’s plan? How does he foreshadow the threefold office of Jesus Christ?
> 3. ⁠In times of struggle and hardship, how can we, like Hannah, trust God with our pain and rely on His promises?

📖 **Passage to read**: ==1 Samuel 02:12-36==

> [!info]- 🎙️Audio: [A Daily Devotional - 04.03 - EN]()  

There may be no place where corruption in leadership is more shocking and painful than in the church. Our pastors and spiritual leaders are supposed to be godly men of integrity, character, and humility. Sadly, Eli, the priest, had two sons who were spiritual leaders, but they were the perfect example of corruption at every level. These priests had become thoroughly corrupt, and God would no longer tolerate it.

So, what exactly was wrong with the behavior of Eli’s sons, Hophni and Phinehas? First, they disobeyed God’s instructions on how priests were to make sacrifices for the people. God had established a way for priests to take food for themselves from the animal sacrifices brought to them, but it was very specific. The priests could only take meat from the breast and the right thigh of the animal. But what did these priests do? They used a three-pronged fork to take whatever meat came up from the boiling pot—meaning they were taking far more than what was permitted. Hophni and Phinehas were stealing from the sacrifices that were meant for God’s people, doing so right in the middle of worship. On top of that, they were sleeping with the women who served at the entrance to the tent of meeting (2:22).

Imagine yourself as an Israelite at that time. You come to worship, bringing an animal to offer as a sacrifice for your sins according to God’s law. But when you arrive, the priest takes more than his share, and you can’t even offer the full sacrifice to God! Your mediator—the one who is supposed to bring you before a holy God—is corrupt, filthy, and unfit for the role. You would begin to wonder, "Can this man really stand between me and a holy God?" This passage shows us that God’s people need a faithful priest. Amid the terrible story of corrupt leaders, we find this verse as a contrast: “Now the boy Samuel continued to grow both in stature and in favor with the LORD and also with man” (2:26). The faithful priest is coming.

> [!important]+ Reflect and Respond
If you find yourself in a position of spiritual leadership, even in a small group or among friends, pray that God would help you use that position wisely. And as you pray, remember that you have a perfect mediator—Jesus, the ultimate priest. You can find forgiveness through His ministry on your behalf.
