### <center>信心的殿堂</center>

> [!info]- 🎙️Audio: [None]()

《希伯来书》第11章是圣经中最广为人知的经文之一。你可能听过有人把它称为“信心的殿堂”。这里记载的，都是历史上最伟大的圣徒；这是纪念那些忠心跟随神之人的地方。这一章读起来很有趣，因为它让人想起许多旧约中伟大的故事。但，《希伯来书》第11章到底在告诉我们什么呢？它的中心是什么？

这一章关于信心，向我们展示了各时代神子民的特征。什么是真正的标记？**信心。**对神的信心，只信靠他，作为救主、创造主和主宰。神的子民——无论在世界历史的哪个阶段——都是借着信心，在神面前蒙恩得喜悦。

同时，这一章也提醒我们：神的恩典够大，足以拯救那些远非完美的人。再看看这一章中被提到的名字：耶利哥城的妓女拉哈，她加入了神的子民；参孙，他幼稚而稍显失控的壮汉；耶弗他，他作了极愚蠢而悲惨的许愿。这些人未必都是你想得到会出现在这里的人！但凭着神的恩典，他们都被列在这忠心子民的名单里。**神的恩典奇妙无比，足够包容像你我这样的罪人。**

最后，我们要明白，这一章清楚地告诉我们：对神的忠心在世上会带来不同的结果。有些人获得伟大的胜利和成就；有些人则经历极大的痛苦！神的应许不是说信心会带来地上的舒适。事实上，对某些人来说，信靠耶稣可能会带来极大的痛苦和折磨。但最终，所有真心信靠神的人都有同一个盼望：**将来在那城中、在神的国度里，永远与耶稣——那伟大的王与救主同在。**

> [!important]+ 反思与回应
祈求神，让你被记入所有时代的子民之中，他们因信靠神而被标记。求他赐你力量，相信他的应许；赐你勇气，按照他的话而活。祈求他使你只信靠基督，作为你的救主。并且，凭着他的恩典，期待有一天，你能站在大卫、亚伯拉罕、摩西以及所有神所救赎之人的中间，永远赞美他的名。

### <center>The Hall of Faith</center>

📖 **Passage to read**: ==Hebrews 11==

> [!info]- 🎙️Audio: [None]()  


Hebrews 11 is one of the most well-known passages in all of Scripture. You’ve probably heard Hebrews 11 referred to as “The Hall of Faith.” Only the greatest saints in history get mentioned here; it’s the place where great followers of God are remembered. It’s a fun chapter to read, because it calls to mind so many of the great stories of the Old Testament. But what is this chapter in the book of Hebrews really telling us? What is it all about?

This faith chapter shows us the mark of God’s people in every age. What is that true mark? Faith. Faith in God. Trust in him alone as Savior, Creator, and Lord. God’s people—in every point in the history of this world—have found favor with their Creator through faith alone.

But also this faith chapter reminds us that God’s grace is big enough to save even people who are far from perfect. Look again at the names that are mentioned in this chapter: Rahab, the prostitute from Jericho who joined God’s people; Jephthah, the judge who made a terribly foolish and tragic vow; Samson, the immature and slightly out-of-control hulk of a man. These people are not necessarily all ones you would expect to see here! But, by God’s grace, they are listed here in this summary of faithful people. God’s grace is amazing; it is big enough for sinners like you and me.

Finally, we need to see that this chapter is clear that faithfulness to God will have different earthly results. Some people achieve great victory and accomplishment. Others suffer tremendously! God’s promise is not that faith will lead to comfort on this earth. In fact, for some, faith in Jesus is what leads to terrible pain and anguish on earth. But ultimately the hope for all of God’s true people is in the city and the kingdom to come: an eternity in the presence of Jesus, the great King and Savior.

> [!important]+ Reflect and Respond
_Ask God that you would be numbered with his people throughout all the ages who have been marked by their faith in him. Ask him for strength to believe his promises. Ask him for courage to live by his word. Pray that he would enable you to trust in Christ alone as your Savior. And, by his grace, look forward to the day when you will praise his name forever as you stand with David, Abraham, Moses, and the rest of God’s redeemed people._
