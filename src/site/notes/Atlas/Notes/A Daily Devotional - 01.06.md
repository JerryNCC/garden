### 死的循环

> [!info]- 🎙️Audio: [A Daily Devotional - 01.04 - CN]()

如果你曾经怀疑亚当和夏娃的堕落是否真的改变了这个世界，创世记第四章给了我们一个清晰的答案。罪不仅影响了亚当和夏娃——它迅速扩散，在他们的家庭中扎下了根。罪就像一种致命的毒药，渗透到创造的每一个角落，感染它所触及的一切。

创世记第四章是一个令人心碎的篇章。在第五到第八节中，我们看到罪如何紧紧抓住亚当和夏娃的儿子该隐。该隐的献祭没有被神悦纳，而他没有谦卑地回应，反而怒气冲天。即使神警告他罪正在等候，企图掌控他的内心，该隐依然无视这警告。他欺骗他的兄弟亚伯，把他引到田间，残忍地杀害了他。这是一个悲剧性的时刻——兄弟之间竟然发生了手足相残的惨剧。

然而，即使在这样的情况下，神仍然显出恩典。尽管该隐被判在地上流浪，神却在他身上立下保护的记号，并警告任何伤害该隐的人将受到严厉的惩罚。这是圣经中第二次提到神的怜悯。该隐的罪行是否该死？绝对如此。但神在祂的恩典中，仍然饶恕了他。

令人遗憾的是，这一章显示出罪的影响愈发严重。我们遇到了拉麦，一个充满骄傲和暴力的人。他向他的妻子夸耀自己杀了一个年轻人，并声称没有人敢报复他。亚当和夏娃的悖逆释放了一场瘟疫——一种罪的瘟疫——蔓延到他们的后代和整个世界。

但即使在这个黑暗的篇章中，也有一线希望。在本章的结尾，亚当和夏娃又生了一个儿子，名叫塞特。通过他，人们开始公开敬拜神。罪的感染虽然丑陋，但神的计划并未停止。祂仍然为祂的子民预备了一条道路。

> [!important]+ 反思与回应
> 花一点时间环顾这个世界。罪的影响无处不在——在政府、政治、关系中，当然也包括我们自己的内心。但请记住，神的工作还没有结束。回想祂在创世记第三章中的应许：有一天，撒但、罪和死亡都将被打败。今天紧紧抓住耶稣。祂是我们对抗罪唯一的希望，而罪的掌控终究只是暂时的。

### A Deadly Cycle

> [!question]+ Review
> 1. What did Adam and Eve do that made them run and hide from God?
> 2. How did Adam and Eve respond when God confronted them about their disobedience?
> 3. What promise did God give in Genesis 3:15, and how does it point to Jesus?

📖 **Passage to read**: ==Genesis 04==

> [!info]- 🎙️Audio: [A Daily Devotional - 01.04 - EN]()


If you ever wonder whether Adam and Eve’s fall really changed the world, Genesis 4 gives us a clear answer. Sin didn’t just affect Adam and Eve—it spread immediately, taking root in their family. Think of sin like a deadly poison, seeping into every part of creation and infecting everything it touches.

Genesis 4 is a heartbreaking chapter. In verses 5–8, we see how sin’s grip tightens on Cain, Adam and Eve’s son. Cain’s offering to God is not accepted, and instead of responding with humility, Cain becomes angry. Even after God warns him about the sin that’s waiting to take over his heart, Cain ignores the warning. He deceives his brother Abel, lures him into a field, and kills him in cold blood. It’s a tragic moment—one brother taking the life of another.

Yet, even here, God shows grace. Although Cain is sentenced to wander the earth, God places a mark of protection on him. He warns that anyone who harms Cain will face severe consequences. This is the second time we see God’s mercy in the Bible. Does Cain deserve to die for his crime? Absolutely. But God, in His grace, spares him.

Sadly, the chapter shows how sin’s effects only grow worse. We meet Lamech, a man full of pride and violence. He boasts to his wives about killing a young man and claims no one would dare harm him in return. Adam and Eve’s rebellion unleashed a plague—a disease of sin—that spread through their descendants and the world.

But even in this dark chapter, there’s a glimmer of hope. At the end of the chapter, Adam and Eve have another son, Seth. Through him, people begin to publicly worship God. The sin infection is ugly, but God isn’t finished. He still has a plan for His people.

> [!important]+ Reflect and Respond
> Take a moment to look at the world around you. Sin’s effects are everywhere—in governments, politics, relationships, and our own hearts. But remember, God is not done. Think back to His promise in Genesis 3: one day, Satan, sin, and death will be defeated. Hold on to Jesus today. He is our only hope against sin’s hold, and that hold is only temporary.
