### 3. Check for sentence structure 句子结构:

> - **Compound Sentence**: Contains two independent clauses joined by a coordinating conjunction (for, and, nor, but, or, yet, so).
>	- **Example**: "She reads books, and she writes stories."
>	- Structure: Clause 1 + conjunction + Clause 2.
> - **Complex Sentence**: Contains one independent clause and at least one dependent clause (which cannot stand alone).
>	- **Example**: "She reads books because she enjoys learning."
>	- Structure: Independent clause ("She reads books") + dependent clause ("because she enjoys learning").
> - **Compound-Complex Sentence**: Contains at least two independent clauses and one or more dependent clauses.
>	- **Example**: "She reads books, and she writes stories when she has time."
