>	- **Identify Inversion**: In questions, the usual order of subject and verb is inverted.
>	- **Yes/No Questions**: Look for sentences that can be answered with "yes" or "no."

>		- **Example**: "Where do you live?"
>		- Structure: Wh-word ("Where") + auxiliary verb ("do") + subject ("you") + main verb ("live").
>	- **If statement**:
>		- Proceed to step 2.

### 2. 是个否定句还是肯定句？

> [!info]- **否定句？肯定句？**
> - **Positive 肯定句**: The sentence affirms something.
>	- **Example**: "She enjoys reading."
> - **Negative 否定句**: The sentence denies something, often using "not" or negative modals.
>	- **Example**: "She does not like pizza."
>	- Here, "does not" indicates negation of the action.

### 3. Check for sentence structure 句子结构:
> [!info]- **Check for sentence structure:**
> - **Simple Sentence**: Contains one independent clause (a complete thought).
> - **Example**: "She reads books."
>       - Structure: Subject ("She") + verb ("reads") + object ("books").
> - **Compound Sentence**: Contains two independent clauses joined by a coordinating conjunction (for, and, nor, but, or, yet, so).
>	- **Example**: "She reads books, and she writes stories."
>	- Structure: Clause 1 + conjunction + Clause 2.
> - **Complex Sentence**: Contains one independent clause and at least one dependent clause (which cannot stand alone).
>	- **Example**: "She reads books because she enjoys learning."
>	- Structure: Independent clause ("She reads books") + dependent clause ("because she enjoys learning").
> - **Compound-Complex Sentence**: Contains at least two independent clauses and one or more dependent clauses.
>	- **Example**: "She reads books, and she writes stories when she has time."
>	- Structure: Two independent clauses + one dependent clause.

### 4. 句子中有没有从句relative clause?

>	- **Non-Defining Relative Clause**: Adds extra information but is not essential to understanding the sentence.
>		- Example: "My friend, who lives in London, is visiting."
>		- The clause provides additional info but can be removed without changing the main point.
> - **No**:
>	- Move to the next step.

### 5. 这是个被动句 passive voice 吗?

>	- Structure: If-clause (present simple) + main clause (future simple).
> - **Second Conditional** (hypothetical situation in present):
>	- Example: "If I were rich, I would travel the world."
>	- Structure: If-clause (past simple) + main clause (would + base form).
