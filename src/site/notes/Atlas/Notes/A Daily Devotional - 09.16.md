### <center>复活的君王</center>

> [!info]- 🎙️Audio: [None]()

马太在福音书的结尾，宣告耶稣的得胜。七日的第一日清早，抹大拉的马利亚和另一位马利亚来到坟墓前，她们看见一位天使在那等候。他的容貌明亮威严，令人惊惧。天使向她们报好消息，说耶稣已经复活了。她们急忙去告诉门徒的时候，耶稣亲自向她们显现。她们见了主，就上前抱住他的脚，拜他（马太福音28:9）。这才是唯一正确的回应：当你站在那位从死里复活的神子面前，惟当敬拜。

然而，并不是人人都以信心回应。马太记载祭司长为了掩盖真相，收买兵丁说门徒把耶稣的身体偷走。想一想，他们明明拥有神迹的证据，却仍拒绝相信，甚至编造谎言来抵挡真理。即使复活的主就在眼前，有些人仍然顽梗不信。那时如此，今日亦然。

如今马太以他开篇的主题作结：耶稣是君王。福音书一开始，以家谱表明耶稣是应许的弥赛亚；如今复活的君王差遣门徒往普天下去，宣扬他自己。请听他的话：“天上地下所有的权柄都赐给我了，所以你们要去……”（马太福音28:18–19）。耶稣为子民舍命，又从死里复活，得着一切权柄，胜过死亡，统管万有。他的命令清晰：去，使万民作门徒，教导他们，并传扬他慈爱国度的福音。

> [!important]+ 反思与回应
祈求上帝赐下力量，使你忠心遵行这命令。求主帮助你专注于使人作门徒，并将耶稣的好消息传给他人。救主已经复活，君王永远活着。他配得我们全心去认识、去侍奉。

### <center>The Risen King</center>

> [!question]+ Review
> 1.⁠ ⁠In which verse does Matthew describe Jesus’ death to show that He truly died, and what exact phrase is used?
2.⁠ ⁠When Jesus cried out, “My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?” (27:46), what kind of suffering was He experiencing?
3.⁠ ⁠What supernatural events took place after Jesus breathed His last, and what spiritual meaning do they reveal?

📖 **Passage to read**: ==Matthew 28==

> [!info]- 🎙️Audio: [None]()  

Matthew ends his Gospel with the victory of Jesus. Early on the first day of the week, Mary Magdalene and the other Mary go to the tomb. They find an angel waiting for them. His appearance is so bright and powerful that it frightens them. The angel tells them the good news: Jesus has risen. As they hurry to tell the disciples, Jesus himself appears. What do they do when they see him? Matthew says, “They came up and took hold of his feet and worshiped him” (28:9). This is the only right response. When you stand before the Son of God who has risen from the dead, you worship.

But not everyone responds with faith. Matthew tells of the chief priests who plot to cover up the truth. They bribe the soldiers to say that the disciples stole the body. Think about that. They have all the evidence of a miracle, but they still refuse to believe. They even invent a lie to fight against the truth. Some people will not believe, even when the risen Lord stands before them. That was true then, and it is still true today.

Now Matthew closes with the same theme he opened with: Jesus is the King. The Gospel began with a genealogy to show that Jesus is the promised Messiah. Now the risen King sends his disciples to tell the world about him. Listen to his words: “All authority in heaven and on earth has been given to me. Go therefore…” (28:18–19). Jesus has full authority because he has died for his people and risen from the grave. He has broken the power of death and rules over all creation. His command is clear: make disciples, teach them, and share the good news of his loving reign.

> [!important]+ Reflect and Respond
Pray for strength to obey this command. Ask God to help you stay focused on making disciples and telling others about Jesus. The Savior has risen. The King lives. He is worth knowing and worth serving with all your heart.
