### <center>走不寻常的道路</center>

在这段经文中，我们看到一个明显的模式：神的百姓的君王是根据他们多么紧跟大卫的脚步来被审判的。但在我们开始为这些跟随大卫的君王感到遗憾之前，我们需要了解他们所遵循的标准。神并没有要求他们达到完美，而是要求他们忠心于神的话语，既是个人的忠诚，也是他们在领导神的百姓方面的忠诚。请记住，大卫也不是完美的！但他的生活展现了稳步顺服神的态度，每当他犯错时，他都会全心悔改。

首先，我们看到罗波安的儿子亚比亚姆。他继承了父亲的王位，但他的统治并没有持续太久——仅仅三年！关于他统治的细节并不多，但我们知道最重要的一点：“他行了他父亲所行的一切罪恶，他的心并不完全向耶和华他的神忠诚”（15:3）。虽然神并没有从他的家族中夺去王位，但他的一生充满了与北国的战争，不久后他就去世了。

接下来，我们看到一位与之形成鲜明对比的君王：亚沙，恶王亚比亚姆的儿子。亚沙“行耶和华眼中看为正的事，像他父亲大卫所行的那样”（15:11）。对于亚沙来说，这意味着努力除去国中的偶像、妓女，甚至剔除一位邪恶的王后母亲。尽管他没有完全铲除偶像崇拜的高地——那些地方曾经进行过很多偶像崇拜——但他仍然被记住为一位忠心于神的君王，行事遵循大卫王的模式。

《列王纪》继续总结接下来的君王的统治，无论是以色列还是犹大。一些记载非常详细，讲述了战争、先知的互动和重要的领导决策。而另一些则较短，往往只有一句话，总结了这位君王的统治，或是赞扬，或是谴责。尽管犹大王国之后仍会有一些好君王，但国家的衰退之路已经开始。从这一点开始，神的百姓将不再有像大卫那样的君王——至少在人的层面上。

> [!important]+ 反思与回应
完美是无法实现的，救恩只有通过神的恩典，以信心接受基督为罪所作的牺牲才能得着。但即便如此，忠诚于耶稣仍应成为我们生活的主旋律。花些时间反思你迄今为止的生活。你是否在与耶稣同行？你的生活是否展现出忠诚于祂的模式？

> 1. ⁠Why do the reigns of Jeroboam and Rehoboam reflect God's serious attitude towards sin? What lessons can we learn from their stories?
> 2. ⁠How do the failures of Rehoboam and Jeroboam manifest in their spiritual leadership? What lessons do their failures provide for us in leadership and responsibility today?

📖 **Passage to read**: ==1 Kings 15:01-24==

> [!info]- 🎙️Audio: [A Daily Devotional - 05.12 - EN]()  

In this passage, we see a clear pattern emerging: the kings of God’s people are judged by how closely they follow in the footsteps of David. But before we start feeling too bad for these kings who followed David, it’s important to understand what standard they were being held to. God wasn’t expecting them to be perfect. What He wanted was faithfulness—to His word personally, and in the way they led His people. Remember, David wasn’t perfect either! But his life showed a steady commitment to obeying God, and when he sinned, he repented with all his heart.

First, we read about Abijam, the son of Rehoboam. When Rehoboam dies, Abijam takes over, but his reign doesn’t last long—only three years. We don’t get many details about his reign, but we do know this: “He walked in all the sins that his father did before him, and his heart was not wholly true to the LORD his God” (15:3). Although God didn’t take away the kingship from his line, his reign was marked by war with the northern kingdom, and it wasn’t long before he died.

Next, we read about a king who stands in stark contrast: Asa, the son of the wicked king Abijam. Asa “did what was right in the eyes of the LORD, as David his father had done” (15:11). For Asa, this meant working to remove idols, prostitutes, and a wicked queen mother from the land. Though he didn’t completely eliminate the high places of worship—where much idolatry took place—he is remembered as a king who was faithful to God and walked in the pattern of King David before him.

The book of 1 Kings continues by summarizing the reigns of the kings who followed David and Solomon, both in Israel and Judah. Some of these accounts are detailed, filled with stories of battles, interactions with prophets, and key leadership decisions. Others are much shorter, often only a sentence long, summarizing the reign with either praise or condemnation. While there will still be some good kings in Judah, the kingdom is clearly on a downward path. From this point on, there will be no other king like David—at least not in a human sense.

> [!important]+ Reflect and Respond
Perfection isn’t possible, and salvation comes only through God’s grace, received by faith in the sacrifice of Christ. But even so, faithfulness to Jesus should mark our lives. Take a moment to reflect on your life so far. Are you walking with Jesus? Does your life reflect a pattern of faithfulness to Him?
