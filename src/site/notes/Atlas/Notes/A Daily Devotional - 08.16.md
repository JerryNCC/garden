### <center>休想逃脱！</center>

> [!info]- 🎙️Audio: [None]()

想一想，当父母管教你的时候，即使他们责骂或惩罚你，你依然是他们的孩子。他们也许会限制你的自由，或取消某些特权，但他们仍会给你晚餐，仍会让你在家中过夜。在《以西结书》第25章中，我们看到神与祂百姓的关系也是如此。祂对他们的审判严厉——因为他们的罪确实深重——但这并不表示祂与他们的关系就此结束。即使在审判中，祂依然关心他们，这在祂对待欺压祂百姓的列国时显而易见。

这一章标志着《以西结书》的一个转折点。此前，焦点一直在神对自己百姓的审判；但从这里开始，焦点转向以色列周围的列国——亚扪、摩押、以东和非利士，这四个最邻近的国家。神曾因以色列离弃祂，如同妻子背弃丈夫而发怒；但祂同样也向这些列国发怒。它们不但袖手旁观以色列的败落，还幸灾乐祸，甚至推波助澜。神说，它们绝不会逃脱惩罚。

神为何如此震怒？是因为它们对祂百姓的态度。即使神在管教以色列，祂也从未停止保护他们。以亚扪为例，神这样说：“因为你曾因我的圣所被亵渎、以色列地变为荒凉、犹大家被掳而说：‘阿哈！’所以我必将你交给东方人作业物。”（25:3-4）神看见他们的讥笑与残忍，便施行公义的报应。

这章虽然出自以色列历史的黑暗时刻，却指向神最终保护祂百姓的方式——耶稣基督。唯有祂能战胜他们最可怕的仇敌，包括他们内心的罪。

> [!important]+ 反思与回应
这就是我们的神——信实、忍耐、慈爱。祂从未停止拯救祂的百姓，甚至亲自进入人类历史，道成肉身，为他们的缘故担当审判。这样的信实，何等奇妙，几乎令人难以置信——这是那位纵使祂的百姓偏离，仍不止息爱的神。

> 1.⁠ ⁠In Ezekiel 16, how does God use the image of an “abandoned baby” to describe Israel’s early condition? What aspect of God’s character does this illustrate?
2.⁠ ⁠How did Israel use God’s blessings to betray Him? What specific acts of betrayal are mentioned in the passage?
3.⁠ ⁠According to this passage, why does God use the nations Israel relied on to judge her? What warning does this give us for our faith today?

📖 **Passage to read**: ==Ezekiel  25==

> [!info]- 🎙️Audio: [None]()  

Think about when your parents disciplined you. Even if they scolded or punished you, you were still their child. They might have grounded you or taken away privileges, but they still gave you dinner and let you sleep under their roof. In Ezekiel 25, we see something similar in God’s relationship with his people. His judgment on them has been strong—because their sin was real and serious. But that doesn’t mean he’s finished with them. His care for them is still there, even in the way he deals with the nations that have mistreated them.

This chapter marks a turning point in Ezekiel. Up to now, the focus has been on God’s judgment of his own people. But here the spotlight shifts to the surrounding nations—Ammon, Moab, Edom, and Philistia, Israel’s closest neighbors. God has been angry with Israel for turning from him, like an unfaithful wife turning from her husband. Yet he is also angry with these nations. They didn’t just stand by while Israel fell—they took pleasure in it and even helped bring it about. God says they won’t get away with it.

Why is God so upset with them? It’s about how they treated his people. Even while he is disciplining Israel, he hasn’t stopped protecting them. Take his words to Ammon as an example: “Because you said, ‘Aha!’ over my sanctuary when it was profaned, and over the land of Israel when it was made desolate, and over the house of Judah when they went into exile, therefore behold, I am handing you over to the people of the East” (25:3–4). God sees their mocking and their cruelty, and he responds with justice.

This chapter may come from a dark moment in Israel’s history, but it points ahead to the ultimate way God protects his people—through Jesus Christ. He is the one who defeats their greatest enemies, even the sin in their own hearts.

> [!important]+ Reflect and Respond
That’s the kind of God we have—faithful, patient, loving. He didn’t stop working to save his people. He stepped into history himself, taking on flesh and bearing judgment for their sake. This is amazing, almost unbelievable faithfulness—from a God who never stops loving even those who wander from him.
