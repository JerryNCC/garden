### <center>隐藏的罪</center>

> [!info]- 🎙️Audio: [A Daily Devotional - 06.03 - CN]()

从表面看起来，神的子民一切安好——至少在以斯拉记第九章之前是如此。圣殿已经重建，敬拜也恢复了，以斯拉正在忠心地按着神的律法教导百姓。从外面看，一切似乎井然有序。但当我们深入观察，却发现了一个更深层的问题。就像冰箱里被忽略的草莓盒，乍看之下鲜红诱人，但扒开一看，霉菌早已悄悄滋生。在神子民中，罪也正以同样的方式潜入，并开始蔓延。

这罪到底是什么呢？就是与不敬拜独一真神之人通婚的罪。神曾清楚吩咐祂的子民要分别为圣，这不是因为种族或民族的原因，而是出于对圣洁的要求。与拜偶像的人通婚，往往会导致信仰的妥协、拜偶像和道德的败坏，最终带来整个信仰体系的崩塌。令人震惊的是，犯这罪最严重的，竟是那些作领袖的人——那些官长和首领。有人向以斯拉报告：“这事上，首领和官长为罪魁。”（9:2）

以斯拉的反应并不轻率。他满心忧伤，撕裂衣服，拔头发和胡须。他没有自外于这罪，而是深刻体会其严重性。虽然他本人没有犯这罪，但他却为整个群体的罪感到极度痛苦。他的祷告透露了他对神圣洁的敬畏与哀伤：“我的神啊，我抱愧蒙羞，不敢向我神仰面；因为我们的罪孽滔天，我们的罪恶滔天而上。”（9:6）他认同这是神子民的罪，他真诚地承认，带着痛悔与谦卑把这一切带到神面前。

> [!important]+ 反思与回应
愿以斯拉的心成为你今天祷告的榜样。求神赐你一颗为罪忧伤的心——不仅为你自己的罪，也为教会中那些伤害神百姓的罪而哀伤。求神赐你那种能带来认罪的忧伤，并因知道耶稣来是要除灭这罪，而得着真正的喜乐和平安。

### <center>Sinister Sin</center>

> [!question]+ Review
> 1. Why is Ezra’s priestly identity and genealogy important? How does it affect his authority in teaching the people?
> 2. What does it reveal about Ezra’s spiritual character and mission when he “resolved to study, to observe the Law of the Lord, and to teach His statutes and rules to Israel”?
> 3. What role did King Artaxerxes of Persia play in Ezra leading the people back? What message does this convey about God’s control over history?

📖 **Passage to read**: ==Ezra 09==

> [!info]- 🎙️Audio: [A Daily Devotional - 06.03 - EN]()  

Things seem to be going well for God’s people—at least up to Ezra 9. The temple has been rebuilt, worship has resumed, and Ezra is faithfully teaching the people according to God’s law. From the outside, everything looks fine. But a closer look shows a deeper problem. It’s like a box of strawberries in the fridge. They may look fresh and bright at first, but under the top layer, mold has started to spread. In the same way, sin has taken root in the community of Israel.

The sin, specifically, is intermarriage with people who do not worship the one true God. God had clearly called His people to remain separate, not because of race or ethnicity, but because of holiness. Marrying those who follow other gods always led to compromise, idolatry, and eventually, the collapse of faith. What makes this even more troubling is who is involved. The leaders—the officials and key figures—are the ones most responsible. Ezra is told, “In this unfaithfulness, the hand of the officials and chief men has been foremost” (9:2).

Ezra’s response is not light or casual. It is full of grief. He tears his clothes. He pulls out his hair and beard. He doesn’t stand apart or look down on others—he takes the sin seriously. Though he wasn’t guilty of this sin himself, Ezra feels the weight of it on the whole community. His prayer shows us his heart. “O my God,” he says, “I am ashamed and blush to lift my face to you, my God, for our sins have risen higher than our heads, and our guilt has reached the heavens” (9:6). He owns the sin as part of God’s people. He confesses it honestly. He brings it before God in sorrow and humility.

> [!important]+ Reflect and Respond
Let Ezra’s heart shape your prayers today. Ask God to give you a heart that grieves over sin—not just your own, but also the sin that hurts the body of Christ. Pray for a sorrow that leads to confession and a joy that comes from knowing Jesus came to put an end to sin forever.
