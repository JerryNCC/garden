### <center>「活着就是基督」</center>

> [!info]- 🎙️Audio: [None]()


在《哥林多前书》中，保罗的语气锋利而严厉。哥林多教会一团乱：罪恶横行，人际破裂，纷争不断。然而，当他提笔写信给腓立比教会时，情形却大不相同。我们很快就感觉到，他对这间教会充满喜乐。他几乎是带着激动这样写道：「我每逢想念你们，就感谢我的神；每逢为你们众人祈求的时候，常常欢欢喜喜地祈求」（1:3–4）。这群信徒在许多方面都叫他得安慰——他们慷慨、忠心，长期在福音事工上与他同工，显出这是一间属灵健康的教会。

然而，即便是这样的教会，也不是没有危险。保罗深知，任何教会都可能在某些地方慢慢偏离。在这段经文中，他指出腓立比人所面对的一个特别危险——这个危险其实我们也很熟悉：**他们很容易失去因福音而来的喜乐**。他们的喜乐，往往随着环境的改变而忽上忽下，而不是牢牢系在耶稣基督的福音不断推进这件事上。保罗直接针对这一点来教导他们。

他先谈自己在罗马被囚的处境。（他很可能就是在罗马的监牢中写下这一封信。）照常理，我们会以为，这样的处境足以叫人沮丧、绝望。然而，保罗却出人意外地充满喜乐。为什么？因为他看见，他的锁链反而「使福音兴旺」（1:12）。因着他的被囚，有人听见了福音，也有许多信徒因此更放胆传讲基督。甚至，有些人趁他坐牢之际攻击他、贬低他、抬高自己，把自己当成「对手式」的传道人——保罗也不因此动摇。只要基督被传开，他的心就满足。透过自己的经历，保罗要腓立比人看见：**他的喜乐，是系在福音的进展上，而不是环境的优劣上**。

在这样的背景中，保罗写下他一段最为人熟悉的话——关于生与死的看法。他用一句话总结自己的生命观：「因我活着就是基督，我死了就有益处」（1:21）。对他来说，活着，就是继续服事基督、传扬福音；死了，更好，因为那意味着与救主同在，亲眼见主的面。这是一个清晰、坚定的属天眼光，也极值得我们反复思想、效法。

> [!important]+ 反思与回应
那么，你的喜乐是系在什么上呢？是成绩、健康、人际关系、环境顺利，还是系在耶稣基督自己和祂福音的广传上？  
求神帮助你，把喜乐的根扎在基督里，而不是扎在其他会改变、会动摇的事物上。愿主教导你，像保罗一样说：活着是为基督，死了是得着基督。

📖 **Passage to read**: ==Philippians 01==

> [!info]- 🎙️Audio: [None]()  


Paul’s tone in 1 Corinthians is sharp, even painful. That church was tangled in sin, broken relationships, and divisions. But when Paul turns to the church in Philippi, we sense something very different. He can hardly hold back his joy. “I thank my God in all my remembrance of you, always in every prayer of mine for you all making my prayer with joy” (1:3–4). These believers had encouraged Paul deeply. Their generosity and steady partnership in the gospel had shown him that they were a healthy and faithful church.

Still, even a strong church can drift. Paul knows this. Here, he points out a danger the Philippians face—one that is all too familiar to us as well. They are in danger of losing their gospel joy. Their joy rises and falls with their circumstances, instead of resting on the steady movement of the gospel of Jesus Christ. Paul addresses this directly.

He begins by speaking about his imprisonment in Rome. (He is likely writing from a Roman jail.) Yet his attitude is surprising. Paul is joyful. Why? Because even his chains have “served to advance the gospel” (1:12). The message of Jesus has reached new ears because he is in prison, and believers have grown bolder in speaking about Christ. Even those who preach with wrong motives do not unsettle him. His concern is that Christ is proclaimed. Paul wants the Philippians to see that his joy is tied, not to comfort, but to the progress of the gospel.

It is in this setting that Paul speaks some of his most memorable words—words about life and death. He sums up his whole outlook in one line: “To me to live is Christ, and to die is gain” (1:21). Living means serving Christ and sharing his gospel. Dying means being with Christ himself, and that is far better. Paul’s perspective is clear and steady, and it is one we should take to heart.

> [!important]+ Reflect and Respond
So we must ask: What shapes your joy? Pray that God would fix your joy firmly on Jesus Christ. Let it rest in him, and not in anything else.
