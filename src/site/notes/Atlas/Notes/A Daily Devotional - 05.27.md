### <center>约西亚王</center>

> [!info]- 🎙️Audio: [A Daily Devotional - 05.27 - CN]()

当我们查考以色列与犹大历代诸王的故事时，会发现一些清晰的模式。首先，我们明白，没有任何一位属世的君王能够真正拯救神的子民。他们需要一位更伟大的王——一位永远掌权的君王，能救他们脱离自己的败坏与软弱。其次，我们看见，即使审判临到，神仍是信实的。他的计划远超惩罚本身。即便犹大也将被掳，神的怜悯却不止息；祂永不撇弃自己的百姓。

正因如此，约西亚的故事显得格外珍贵。一开始，圣经就这样描述他：“他行耶和华眼中看为正的事，效法他祖大卫一切所行的，不偏左右。”（列王纪下 22:2）约西亚在神面前行正道。更令人惊奇的是，他登基时年仅八岁。

在他作王第十八年，事情有了转变。当时神的圣殿已经年久失修。约西亚下令筹集资金，着手修缮圣殿。工人们在修殿过程中，意外发现了一卷失落多年的律法书。他们将书呈给王，有人在他面前高声诵读。

约西亚静听这卷律法书的内容，心中大受震动。他意识到百姓偏离神的道有多么深远。他们忽视神的话语，违背祂的诫命。约西亚痛心疾首，为百姓的罪悲伤悔改，他撕裂衣服，表示哀痛与懊悔。

接下来，约西亚没有装作若无其事，也没有拖延。他凭信心接受神的话，立刻回应。这正是信靠神的真实表现。他也采取具体行动。在列王纪下第23章中，我们读到约西亚推行的改革。他除掉偶像，废除一切拜假神的祭坛，努力带领百姓恢复对真神的敬拜。

尽管约西亚的信心与改革无法改变神对百姓的审判决定，神仍然悦纳他的心志。神应许他，在他执政期间，灾祸不会临到。

现在，我们也该扪心自问：我们是否像约西亚一样对待神的话语？我们是否用谦卑的心认真聆听、敏锐回应？当圣经揭示我们的罪时，我们是否愿意悔改、更新？


> [!important]+ 反思与回应
今天，不妨向神祷告，求祂赐你一颗如约西亚般谦卑受教的心，愿意聆听、悔改并顺服。也求神帮助你热爱祂的话语，并照着去行。

### <center>King Josiah</center>

> [!question]+ Review
> 1. ⁠How did King Hezekiah respond to the threat from Assyria, and what spiritual qualities did this reveal about him?
> 2. What did Hezekiah’s prayer reveal about his understanding of God and his attitude towards God? What insights does this provide for our own faith today?
> 3. How did God respond to Hezekiah’s prayer and deliver Judah? What lessons about trusting God can we learn from this event?

📖 **Passage to read**: ==2 Kings 22==

> [!info]- 🎙️Audio: [A Daily Devotional - 05.27 - EN]()  

When we study the kings of Israel and Judah, we start to see some patterns. First, we realize that no human king can truly save God’s people. They need a greater King—one who will rule them forever and rescue them from their own brokenness. Second, we see that even when judgment comes, God is still faithful. He has a plan that goes beyond punishment. Even when exile is coming, God’s mercy remains. He won’t give up on his people.

That’s what makes Josiah’s story so special. Right from the start, we’re told something remarkable: “He walked in all the way of David his father, and he did not turn aside to the right or to the left” (2 Kings 22:2). Josiah did what was right in God’s eyes. This is even more amazing when you learn that he became king at only eight years old.

We first hear about Josiah’s actions in the eighteenth year of his reign. By this time, God’s temple was falling apart again. So Josiah gathers money to repair it. While the workers are fixing things, they find something—an old copy of the book of the Law, long forgotten. The scroll is brought to Josiah, and someone reads it aloud to him.

As he listens, Josiah is shaken. He realizes how far the people have drifted from God’s ways. They’ve ignored God’s word. They’ve broken his commands. Josiah is heartbroken. He tears his clothes in sorrow and repentance.

What does Josiah do next? He doesn’t ignore what he’s heard. He doesn’t delay. He believes God’s word and responds in faith. That’s what real trust in God looks like. He acts, too. In 2 Kings 23, we read about the reforms Josiah made. He got rid of false gods. He shut down idol worship. He worked hard to turn the people back to true worship.

Josiah’s faith and reforms didn’t stop the judgment that was coming. God had already decided to discipline his people. But God was pleased with Josiah’s heart. And he gave Josiah this promise: disaster would not come during his reign.

Now we have to ask ourselves: Do we treat God’s word like Josiah did? Do we listen carefully and respond with humble hearts? Are we willing to change when Scripture shows us our sin?

> [!important]+ Reflect and Respond
Pray that God would give you a heart like King Josiah—one that listens, repents, and obeys. Ask him to help you love his word and live by it.
