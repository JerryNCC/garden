### <center>上帝的信实与恩典</center>

> [!info]- 🎙️Audio: [A Daily Devotional - 01.04 - CN]()


电视购物广告令人厌烦。一位吵闹的主持人没完没了地推销一款你根本不会买的产品，一再强调这是一笔“不可错过的交易！”就在你以为广告要结束时，他们突然抛出一句：“但是，等等，还有更多！”接着，他们又加上额外的赠品，试图让这个交易更吸引人。

在《创世记》第21章中，我们看到类似的“但是，等等，还有更多”的时刻。这并非噱头，而是上帝丰盛恩典与信实的美丽展现。这一切从以撒的出生开始。经过多年的等待，上帝终于兑现了对亚伯拉罕和撒拉的应许，在他们年老时赐下一个儿子。这并非普通的出生，而是一个奇迹。亚伯拉罕和撒拉早已无法生育，但上帝始终信守祂的应许。经文清晰地强调了这一点：“耶和华照着所说的话眷顾撒拉，耶和华向撒拉成就所应许的。”

但是，等等，还有更多。

多年前，亚伯拉罕对上帝的应许产生疑虑。他选择依靠自己的方法，与撒拉的使女夏甲生下了一个儿子——以实玛利。如今，以撒的出生改变了一切。以实玛利不再是上帝应许的继承人。撒拉与夏甲之间的矛盾迫使亚伯拉罕不得不送走夏甲和以实玛利。对一位父亲来说，这无疑是一个令人心碎的决定。

然而，即使在这种情况下，上帝的恩典依然闪耀。祂没有抛弃以实玛利。尽管这个孩子是因亚伯拉罕的缺乏信心而出生的，上帝仍然关爱他并祝福他。以实玛利最终成为一个大国的祖先，正如上帝所应许的。虽然他的许多后代后来与上帝的子民为敌，但在这一刻，我们清楚地看到上帝对不配之人的恩典是多么丰盛。

> [!important]+ 反思与回应
上帝的信实令人惊叹。祂信守承诺，并将超乎我们所配得的恩典倾注给我们。今天，请花一些时间思考上帝赐予你的丰盛恩典，尤其是那最宝贵的恩典——我们的救主耶稣基督。

### <center>God Is Faithful</center>

> [!question]+ Review
>1. How did Abraham intercede for Sodom and Gomorrah, and how did God respond?
 >2. How is the sinfulness of Sodom depicted in Genesis 19? How does this passage describe the city's depravity?
>3. How does God reveal both His grace and judgment in the destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah?

📖 **Passage to read**: ==Genesis 21:1-21==

Infomercials can be so annoying. A loud host raves endlessly about some product you’d never buy, piling on reasons why it’s “a deal you can’t pass up!” And just when you think it’s over, they hit you with, “But wait, there’s more!” Suddenly, they’re throwing in extras to make the offer even sweeter.

In Genesis 21, we see a kind of “but wait, there’s more” moment—not in a gimmicky way, but in a beautiful display of God’s abundant grace and faithfulness. It starts with the birth of Isaac. After years of waiting, God fulfills his promise to Abraham and Sarah, giving them a son in their old age. This wasn’t just any birth—it was a miracle. Abraham and Sarah had long been unable to have children. But God is always faithful to his promises. The text makes this crystal clear: “The LORD visited Sarah as he had said, and the LORD did to Sarah as he had promised.”

But wait, there’s more.

Years earlier, Abraham doubted God’s promise. He took matters into his own hands and had a child, Ishmael, with Hagar, Sarah’s servant. Now, with Isaac’s birth, Ishmael is no longer the heir to God’s promises. The tension between Sarah and Hagar forces Abraham to send Hagar and Ishmael away—a heartbreaking decision for a father.

Even here, God’s grace shines. He doesn’t abandon Ishmael. Though the boy was born out of Abraham’s lack of faith, God still cares for him and blesses him. Ishmael becomes the father of a great nation, just as God promised. While many of his descendants would later oppose God’s people, this moment shows God’s overflowing grace, even to those who don’t deserve it.

> [!important]+ Reflect and Respond
God’s faithfulness is amazing. He keeps his promises and pours out grace beyond anything we deserve. Take time today to reflect on how God has blessed you, especially through the greatest gift of all—Jesus Christ, our Savior.
