**[Scene: Two friends, Anna and Ben, are sitting outside on a sunny day, chatting while watching people at the park.]**

**Anna**: Look at that man over there trying to **tie** his shoe. He’s struggling so much!

**Ben**: (laughing) Maybe he’s just being a bit **foolish**. It’s not that hard to **tie** a shoe, is it?

**Anna**: You’d be surprised. I once saw someone trip because their shoelace was untied, and they **dropped** their coffee all over themselves!

**Ben**: Oh no, that’s embarrassing. Speaking of dropping, did you know that if you drop something on the **earth**, it always falls down because of gravity?

**Anna**: Of course, I know that! Gravity is why the **earth** is such a cool place to live.

**Ben**: True. Hey, look at that **flag** flying near the playground. It’s so colorful!

**Anna**: Yeah, it’s beautiful. I think it’s for the festival this weekend. Are you going?

**Ben**: Maybe. It depends on the **weather**. If it rains, I’ll probably stay home.

**Anna**: Makes sense. But does it really **matter**? You could just take an umbrella and still have fun.

**Ben**: That’s true. I guess I’m just lazy. By the way, why are all the tables here so **round**? No corners to bump into?

**Anna**: (laughing) Maybe! Or maybe they think it looks nicer.

**Ben**: Hmm, I’ll **take** that as the answer. Let’s grab some ice cream before the shop closes!

**Anna**: Good idea. Just don’t **drop** it like you did last time!

**Ben**: (grinning) Hey, that was an accident!
