### <center>你已拥有完整的神话语</center>

> [!info]- 🎙️Audio: [None]()

我们中许多人都曾盼望能亲眼见到耶稣的生活与工作。我们以为，如果能亲眼看见祂，我们所有的疑惑就会消失。但马可会对我们说：“绝不是这样。”事实上，他要告诉我们，相比那些亲历其事的人，我们今天更有条件去信靠耶稣。

耶稣早已清楚地预言自己的受死与复活。你会以为祂的门徒，甚至那些跟随祂的妇女，都会预备好迎接这一切。然而，他们并没有。看马利亚 Magdalene、雅各的母亲马利亚和撒罗米在七日的第一日走向坟墓时的情形：她们带着香料，要去膏抹祂的身体。她们是否期待看见一位活着的主？并没有。她们以为要去看一具死去的身体。即便天使向她们宣告耶稣已经复活，并吩咐她们去告诉门徒这个好消息，她们却惊惶害怕，什么也不说就逃跑了。她们困惑又恐惧。马可要我们看见，即便是最亲近耶稣的见证人，也很难立刻明白所发生的事。

那我们呢？我们活在一个蒙福的时代。我们能够读到耶稣整全的故事——祂的受死与复活——并有新约圣经为我们阐明这一切的意义。我们拥有完整的圣经见证，不必猜测。神赐给我们清楚、可靠的话语。唯一正确的回应，就是全然信靠祂，将我们的盼望完全放在神的儿子耶稣基督里。

> [!important]+ 反思与回应
花一点时间感谢神赐下这奇妙的恩典。求祂加增你对祂话语的信心，使你单单安息在唯有耶稣基督带来的救恩之中。

> [!question]+ Review
> 1.⁠ ⁠How did Jesus respond to the disciples’ admiration of the temple in Mark 13, and what did He predict would happen?
2.⁠ ⁠What clear signs did Jesus mention to remind us that this world will not last forever?
3.⁠ ⁠According to Jesus’ teaching, what attitude and actions should believers have as they wait for the unknown day of His return?

📖 **Passage to read**: ==Mark 15:33-16:08==

> [!info]- 🎙️Audio: [None]()  

Many of us have wished we could have been there to watch Jesus live and work. We think that if we had seen him with our own eyes, our doubts would disappear. But Mark would tell us, “Not at all.” In fact, he shows us that we are in a better place to believe in Jesus than those who were actually there.

Jesus had spoken clearly about his death and resurrection. You would think his disciples—and even the women who followed him—would have been ready. But they were not. Look at Mary Magdalene, Mary the mother of James, and Salome as they head to the tomb on the first day of the week. They bring spices to anoint him. Are they expecting a living Lord? No. They come to care for a dead body. Even when an angel announces that Jesus has risen and tells them to share the news, they run away in fear and say nothing. They are confused and terrified. Mark wants us to see how hard it was for even the closest witnesses to grasp what was happening.

What about us? We live in a time of great blessing. We can read the whole story of Jesus—his death and resurrection—along with the rest of the New Testament that explains its meaning. We have the full witness of Scripture. We are not left guessing. God has given us his clear, trustworthy word. The right response is to trust it fully and put our hope in Jesus, the Son of God.

> [!important]+ Reflect and Respond
Take a moment to thank God for this gift. Ask him to deepen your faith in his word and to help you rest in the salvation that comes through Jesus alone.
