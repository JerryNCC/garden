### <center>值得的人难以寻觅</center>

> [!info]- 🎙️Audio: [A Daily Devotional - 03.30 - CN]()

让我们仔细看看波阿斯。经文告诉我们，他是一个值得的人。在士师时期，像波阿斯这样的人是相当罕见的。那么，是什么使波阿斯在这段经文中显得如此值得呢？

首先，波阿斯是在一个充满混乱、叛逆和动荡的时代里，依然忠于神的话语的人。他遵守并坚持神在律法中所命定的拾取麦穗的习惯。拾取麦穗是一种慈善行为，农民在收割后，会留下一些掉落在地上的庄稼，供贫困的人们捡拾，这样他们就能有东西吃。波阿斯在一个不尊重女性的文化中，依然尊重并保护女性。在第8至9节，波阿斯温和地与路得交谈，并明确指示他的工人不要打扰她。拿俄米在第22节中的话告诉我们，在那个时代，女性，尤其是在田地里拾取麦穗的女性，常常会遭到虐待甚至伤害。但波阿斯与众不同——他是一个遵循神话语的男人，尽管没有国王来强制执行这一点。

这一章的结尾有一个重要的转折：波阿斯原来是拿俄米的亲戚，是一位“救赎者”。我们将在下一章更深入了解这意味着什么，但有一点是明确的——这对路得来说是好消息！不过，在结束之前，我想指出这一章开头的一句话。回顾第3节，当路得出去拾取麦穗时，文本说她“恰巧来到了”波阿斯的田地。这个“恰巧来到了”也可以理解为“偶然发生”，但这句词语是带有讽刺意味的。换句话说，我们应当意识到，这并非偶然，神在其中掌控一切。神正在信实地引导路得，而这一切的开始，便是将她带到像波阿斯这样的值得之人面前。

> [!important]+ 反思与回应
我们可以从波阿斯身上学到很多。他是一个遵循神话语、尊重女性并且与周围世界格格不入的人。在一个道德缺失的文化中，波阿斯选择了生活在正直和忠诚之中。当你跟随耶稣基督时，祈求神赐给你勇气，像波阿斯一样过上值得的生活，在这个可能转背而去的世界中坚定地站立，捍卫神的话语。

### <center>A Worthy Man Is Hard to Find</center>

📖 **Passage to read**: ==Ruth 02==

Let’s take a closer look at Boaz. The text tells us he is a worthy man. In the time of the judges, finding someone like Boaz was probably quite rare. So, what makes Boaz stand out as worthy in this passage?

First, Boaz is a man who remains faithful to God’s word in a time of chaos, disobedience, and unrest. He follows and upholds the practice of gleaning, a commandment from God in the law. Gleaning was a kind of charity where farmers would leave the leftover crops in the field after the harvest so that the poor could gather them and have something to eat. Boaz also treats women with respect and protection in a culture where that was not the norm. In verses 8-9, Boaz speaks kindly to Ruth and gives clear instructions to his workers to leave her alone. Naomi’s words in verse 22 show us that, in that time, it wasn’t uncommon for women, especially those gleaning in the fields, to be mistreated or even harmed. But Boaz is different—he is a man who lives by God’s word, even when there is no king to enforce it.

The chapter ends with an important twist: Boaz turns out to be a relative of Naomi’s, a redeemer. We’ll explore more about what this means in the next chapter, but one thing is clear—it’s good news for Ruth! Before we end, though, I want to point out something from earlier in the chapter. Look back at verse 3. When Ruth goes out to glean, the text says she “happened to come” to Boaz’s field. That phrase “happened to come” could also be read as “by chance,” but it’s meant to be ironic. In fact, we are supposed to see that it’s not by chance at all. God is in control. God is faithfully guiding Ruth, and it starts by bringing her to a worthy man like Boaz.

> [!important]+ Reflect and Respond
We can learn a lot from Boaz. He’s a man who obeys God’s word, treats women with respect, and stands out as different from the rest of the world around him. In a culture that was falling short, Boaz lived with integrity and faithfulness. As you follow Jesus Christ, pray for the courage to live with the same worthiness, standing firm for God’s word, even if the world around you chooses to turn away.
