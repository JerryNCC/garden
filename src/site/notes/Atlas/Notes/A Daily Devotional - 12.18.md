圣经中有些书卷，需要花费相当多的功夫，才能发现作者写作的目的。然而，犹大书并不是这样的书卷！犹大直接告诉读者他写信的原因。他原本希望写信来鼓励他们，但考虑到读者当时的处境，他觉得必须调整写作的重点。犹大调整后的目的，是要鼓励信徒“为那一次交付圣徒的真道竭力争辩”（第 3 节）。犹大所写的这些信徒正处于危险之中。福音的对手已经潜入他们中间，用假教训和罪恶的生活来威胁他们。那么，犹大将如何鼓励这些信徒，为信仰争辩呢？

首先，他提醒信徒神历代对罪的审判。信中间的部分可能让人觉得复杂，但其实并不难理解！犹大引用了几个旧约的例子——没有信靠神的以色列人、所多玛与蛾摩拉的城，以及其他事例——都显示了神对罪的公义审判。犹大的意思是提醒信徒，这样的审判也在等待那些扰乱神子民、并带领他们走入错误的假教师，以及所有跟随他们的人。

其次，他督促信徒在跟随神的过程中付出努力；他告诉他们要“保守自己在神的爱中”，直到耶稣完成救恩（第 21 节）。这种属灵的努力，并非只关乎个人；犹大呼召信徒对人施行怜悯，并努力带回那些被假教师迷惑的人。

最后，犹大提醒信徒，真正能够为信仰争辩，唯有依靠神的大能保守。犹大以圣经中最美的祝福语之一作结，他把信徒交托给那位能“保守你们不失脚”，并在末日“无瑕疵地呈现你们”的神（第 24 节）。归根结底，信徒如何为信仰争辩？他们是被一位有能力且充满爱的神完全保守着！

> [!important]+ 反思与回应 
今天也有假教师——即使是在你身边的环境中！你会常常面对否认福音、否认耶稣基督救恩真理的教导。求神赐你力量，使你在为所知道的真道争辩时，能保守自己住在神的爱中。同时记住，最终保守你直到末日的，是神自己。信靠他，让他为你做到这一切。

📖 **Passage to read**: ==Jude==

> [!info]- 🎙️Audio: [None]()  

Some books in the Bible require serious work in order to discover the author’s purpose in writing. Jude is not one of those books! Jude tells his audience exactly why he is writing. He had hoped to write to encourage them, but he felt compelled to adjust his purpose in light of the situation of his audience. Jude’s adjusted purpose is to encourage them “to contend for the faith that was once for all delivered to the saints” (v. 3). The believers to whom Jude writes are in a dangerous situation. Opponents of the gospel have crept into their midst and are threatening them with false teaching and sinful living. So how will Jude encourage these believers to contend for their faith?

First, he will remind them of God’s judgment on sin throughout the ages. The middle part of the letter of Jude confuses people, but it’s not that complex! Jude refers to several Old Testament examples—the Israelites who didn’t have faith in God, the cities of Sodom and Gomorrah, and others—that all show God’s righteous judgment against sin. Jude is reminding his audience that this kind of judgment waits for the false teachers who are plaguing God’s people, as well as all who follow them.

Second, he will urge them to make an effort as they follow God; he tells them to “keep [them]selves in the love of God” as they wait for Jesus to finish their salvation (v. 21). This spiritual effort will not be individually focused only; Jude calls these believers to show mercy to people and to try to bring people back who have been deceived by false teachers!

Finally, Jude will remind them that the only way they can truly contend for the faith is if they are kept by God’s powerful hand. Jude ends with one of the most beautiful benedictions in the entire Bible. He commits these believers to the God who is able to “keep [us] from stumbling” and to ultimately “present [us] blameless” on the last day (v. 24). Ultimately, how do believers contend for the faith? They are kept—perfectly—by a powerful and loving God!

> [!important]+ Reflect and Respond
_There are false teachers today—even in your context! You will always be confronted with teaching that denies the gospel, the truth about salvation in Jesus Christ. Ask God to give you strength to keep yourself in his love as you contend for the faith that you know is true. And, as you do that, remember that God ultimately is the one who will keep you until the end. Trust him to do that for you!_
