### <center>庆祝神的拯救工作</center>

> [!info]- 🎙️Audio: [A Daily Devotional - 02.19 - CN]()

到《民数记》第九章时，以色列人已经离开埃及整整一年了。你能想象吗？在旷野中生活一年，靠着一位无形的、神秘的神供应、引导和教导。尽管如此，这位信实的神始终与祂的百姓同在。祂赐下律法，教导祂的百姓如何生活，使他们能够与祂亲近并保持团契。即便百姓犯了罪，神也会惩罚他们，但祂并没有完全抛弃他们。当神伟大的拯救纪念日临近时，祂的百姓该按照祂的心意来庆祝和纪念。

在1至14节中，神指示以色列人在旷野中庆祝逾越节。神的百姓照着神的命令行事。经文告诉我们：“以色列人照耶和华所吩咐摩西的一切话行了” (9:5)。甚至那些因接触死人而被认为不洁净的人，也被允许参与这次逾越节的庆祝。唯一的例外是，如果有人在远行的途中，无法参与这一庆祝活动。那么，我们可以从这段经文中学到什么呢？我们看到，神极其重视祂的百姓记住并庆祝祂为他们所做的拯救工作。

《民数记》9章的后半部分总结了神在旷野中神秘而恩典的同在。神的荣耀同在通过会幕上方的云柱显现出来，这云柱成为以色列人穿越旷野的主要引导。当云柱停留在会幕上时，百姓就停留在原地；当云柱升起时，便是时候继续前进。这云柱虽然只是暂时的象征，却展现了一个美丽的画面：神的百姓真正被神引导。

> [!important]+ 反思与回应
神希望祂的百姓花时间一起纪念祂通过耶稣基督在我们生命中所成就的拯救工作。这就是我们为什么聚集在教会中，这也是我们为何唱诗、祷告、听神的话语并彼此教导圣经的原因。今天，花些时间回顾过去，感谢神通过耶稣基督在十字架上为我们所做的拯救工作。今天，就让我们一起庆祝祂的救恩！

### <center>Celebrating God’s Saving Work</center>

> [!question]+ Review
> 1. ⁠What message does God convey to His people through the celebration of the Passover in Numbers 9? Summarize the significance of this celebration.
> 2. ⁠Why does God allow those who are unclean (due to contact with the dead) to participate in the Passover celebration in Numbers 9? Does this reflect God's grace and tolerance toward His people?
> 3. ⁠How does God demonstrate His presence and leadership through the cloud in Numbers 9? What does this mean for the people of Israel?

📖 **Passage to read**: ==Numbers 09==

> [!info]- 🎙️Audio: [A Daily Devotional - 02.19 - EN]()  

By the time we get to Numbers 9, the Israelites have already spent an entire year outside Egypt. Imagine that—living in the wilderness for a year, being fed, guided, and taught by an invisible God who speaks. Yet, through it all, this faithful God stays with His people. He gives them His law, teaching them how to live so they can stay close to Him and in community with one another. Even when they rebel, God punishes them, but He doesn’t abandon them. As the anniversary of God’s great deliverance draws near, it’s time for His people to celebrate and remember as He intends.

In verses 1-14, God gives instructions for the Israelites to celebrate the Passover in the wilderness. The people follow God’s commands. The passage tells us, “According to all that the LORD commanded Moses, so the people of Israel did” (9:5). Even those who were considered unclean because they had touched dead bodies are allowed to take part in the celebration. The only reason someone might not participate is if they are far away on a journey and unable to join in. So, what can we learn about God from this? We see that God values His people remembering and celebrating His work of salvation on their behalf.

The second half of Numbers 9 summarizes God’s mysterious and gracious presence with His people. God’s glorious presence, symbolized by the cloud that rested over the tabernacle, guided the Israelites through the wilderness. When the cloud stayed in place, the people stayed put. When the cloud lifted, it was time to move. This cloud was a temporary symbol, but it shows us a beautiful picture of God’s people truly being led by Him.

> [!important]+ Reflect and Respond
God wants His people to take time to remember His saving work in their lives through Jesus Christ. That’s why we gather as the church. That’s why we sing, pray, listen to God’s word, and teach each other the Bible. Take time today to look back and thank God for the salvation He’s given you through Jesus Christ’s work on the cross. Celebrate His salvation today!
