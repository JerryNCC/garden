### <center>伟大的民族，伟大的名字，伟大的祝福</center>

> [!info]- 🎙️Audio: [A Daily Devotional - 01.11 - CN]() N/A

创世记12章开始了一段故事，这段故事讲述了犹太民族的起源、这个新兴民族的成长、他们在埃及的奴役、在旷野的漂泊，以及他们进入应许之地。然而，在这一切背后，我们将从中学到更多关于神，我们的创造主的真理。祂是这个故事的真正英雄——永远不要忘记这一点！祂是圣洁的神，祂审判罪恶，但祂也是满有恩典的神，祂不会弃绝祂的子民。

这一切从一个人开始：亚伯兰。在创世记12章的开头，我们对这个人了解不多，唯一知道的是他的父亲名叫他拉。很可能他当时遵循着居住在那片土地上的人们的宗教信仰。但我们知道的是，神对他说话，而亚伯兰听见了神的声音。神对他说：“去吧”，而第4节说，“于是亚伯兰去了。”无论亚伯兰过去的生活如何，他都听从了神的话，立刻付诸行动。

回头看一下第1-3节。神对亚伯兰说话，给他发出命令，要他离开，但同时也给了他一个应许。这个应许，准确来说，是一个包含多重内容的约。首先，神应许使亚伯兰成为大国；然后，祂应许要赐福给亚伯兰，使他的名字伟大；接着，神应许亚伯兰成为别人的祝福，且根据别人对亚伯兰的回应，神也会回应他们。最后，神通过亚伯兰应许要赐福给地上所有的家族。这是一个宏伟的应许！神对亚伯兰和他的后代有着远大的计划。这些应许如此重大，而且是无条件的。

这些应许无条件，是件好事，因为我们很快就会发现，亚伯兰无法完全履行他的责任。的确，亚伯兰对神的话语顺服，但他远非完美。如果神的应许是以亚伯兰的完美品格为条件，这个故事可能早就结束了。但即便亚伯兰犯错了，神仍然信守祂与他所立的无条件的约。

> [!important]+ 反思与回应
我们跟随的是那位向不配的人许下无条件应许的神，尽管他们远非完美。然而，我们仍然能从亚伯兰的故事中学到许多东西。今天，祈求神帮助你像亚伯兰一样，迅速并且真诚地回应祂的话语，遵行祂的旨意！

📖 **Passage to read**: ==Genesis 12==

> [!info]- 🎙️Audio: [A Daily Devotional - 01.011 - EN](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Dfu9eJskzfIh_tESYLA4llQQMB178umo/view?usp=drive_link) ✅


Genesis 12 starts a story that marks the beginning of the Jewish people, their growth into a nation, their slavery in Egypt, their time in the desert, and their entry into the promised land. But through all of this, we will learn so much about God, our Creator. He is the true hero of this story—never forget that! He is a holy God who judges, but He is also a gracious God who does not abandon His people.

It all begins with one man: Abram. At the start of Genesis 12, we don’t know much about him, except that his father’s name is Terah. He probably followed the beliefs of the people in his area. But what we do know is that God speaks to him. And Abram listens. God tells him to go, and verse 4 says, "So Abram went." Whatever Abram’s past was, he hears God’s words and obeys them.

Look back at verses 1–3. God speaks to Abram, giving him instructions to go, but He also gives him a promise. It’s a promise—actually, a covenant—that includes several parts. First, God promises to make Abram into a great nation. He also promises to bless him and make his name great. He promises that Abram will be a blessing, and that people will be affected by how they respond to him. Finally, God promises that through Abram, all the families of the earth will be blessed. That’s a huge promise! God has big plans for Abram and his descendants. These promises are big, and they come without any conditions.

It’s good that these promises are unconditional, because it doesn’t take long to see that Abram won’t always be able to keep his part of the deal. Yes, he obeys God’s word, but he is far from perfect. If God’s promises depended on Abram’s perfect character, this story would end here. But God stays true to His covenant with Abram, despite all of Abram’s failures.

> [!important]+ Reflect and Respond
We follow a God who makes unconditional promises to people who don’t deserve them, even though they are far from perfect. But there’s still a lot we can learn from Abram. Pray today that God would help you respond to His word the way Abram did—with quick and faithful obedience!
