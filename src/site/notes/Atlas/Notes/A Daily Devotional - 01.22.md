你是否记得小学时班里有一个霸凌者？他通常是那个比其他同学长得更快的孩子。但生活有一个有趣的规律，那就是它总能让这些霸凌者在谦卑中自省。无论你多么坚强、凶狠或强大，总会有比你更强、更狠的人。

好吧，雅各即将亲自体验这一课！进入故事的是拉班，雅各的亲戚。拉班是一个富有且成功的人，他有一个美丽的女儿，名叫拉结。当雅各来到拉班的土地，第一次见到拉结时，他一见钟情。他答应为拉班工作，以换取拉结的手。

经过漫长的等待，婚礼终于到来。雅各和拉结庆祝，举行盛宴、跳舞、欢喜，最后回到帐篷里度过他们的洞房之夜。但第二天早晨，雅各震惊了。他原以为自己与拉结度过了夜晚，却发现自己和她的姐姐利亚在一起！那个欺骗别人的雅各，竟被精明的拉班所欺骗。

这一刻带有深刻的讽刺，创世记的作者通过雅各对拉班的呼喊来突显这一点：“你为什么欺骗我？”（29:25）。这一刻让人想起了以扫在雅各欺骗父亲以撒之后的呼喊。或许，在那一刻，雅各看见了与自己关系疏远的兄弟的面容，感受到被欺骗的痛楚。

让我们不要忽视整个创世记的宏大故事。神依然信实地履行祂对那些不配得到祂恩典的人所做的应许。雅各如今有了两位妻子——利亚和拉结，神将赐福于她们，让她们生育子嗣。这些子嗣将继续承载着神对祂子民的祝福承诺。尽管雅各有着诸多缺点和失败，神依然决心要祝福他。

> [!important]+ 反思与回应
回顾亚当与夏娃、该隐与亚伯、诺亚、亚伯拉罕、以撒，直到现在的雅各，我们看到一个共同的主题：神坚决要祝福祂的子民，并且无论他们如何反抗祂的祝福，神始终会履行祂的应许。今天，让我们感谢神，祂始终致力于祝福我们，最伟大的祝福就是通过耶稣基督，祂的儿子，我们的救主。

> 1. What did Jacob see in his dream during the journey? What does this dream symbolize?  
> 2. What promise did God make to Jacob in the dream? How does God respond to Jacob’s need?  
> 3. How did Jacob respond to God’s revelation and promises? What is the significance of his response?

📖 **Passage to read**: ==Genesis 29:1-30==

Do you remember a bully in your elementary school class? It’s usually a kid who grows faster than everyone else. But the interesting thing about life is that it has a way of humbling such bullies. No matter how tough, mean, or strong you are, there will always be someone tougher and meaner than you.  

Well, Jacob is about to experience that lesson himself! Enter Laban, a relative of Jacob’s. Laban is wealthy, successful, and has a beautiful daughter named Rachel. When Jacob arrives in Laban’s land and sees Rachel for the first time, he’s struck by love at first sight. He agrees to work for Laban in exchange for Rachel’s hand in marriage.  

After a long wait, the wedding day arrives. Jacob and Rachel celebrate with a feast, dance, and joy, finally retreating to the tent for their first night together. But in the morning, Jacob gets a shock. He thought he had spent the night with Rachel, but instead, it was her older sister Leah! Jacob, the deceiver, has been deceived by the crafty Laban.  

This moment carries a deep irony, which the writer of Genesis highlights with Jacob’s exclamation to Laban: “Why then have you deceived me?” (29:25). It’s a moment that echoes Esau’s words to his father Isaac after Jacob deceived him. Perhaps, in that moment, Jacob even saw the face of his estranged brother, feeling the sting of the deception.  

> [!important]+ Reflect and Respond
Let’s not lose sight of the larger story we’re part of here. God is still faithful to keep His promises to people who don’t deserve them. Jacob now has two wives—Leah and Rachel—and God will bless them with children. These children will continue carrying the promise of blessing to God’s people. Despite Jacob’s flaws and failures, God is determined to bless him.
