### <center>耶和华的荣光离开圣殿</center>

> [!info]- 🎙️Audio: [None]()

在以西结的异象中，我们再次看见那些天使般的活物，以及那奇异旋转的轮子。它们伴随着神荣耀的同在而来。神为什么再次将这异象显给以西结呢？是要提醒先知，神亲自、且大有能力地临到祂百姓的审判中。神吩咐其中一位基路伯说：“你要从基路伯中间、转轮之间取火，把手盛满了，洒在城上。”（10:2）在6至8节，这火的图画继续延伸——天使手中高举着火，要倾倒在城上。这是审判的明证——必定临到，焚烧吞灭，无可逃避。

然而，有一个问题：若神与祂的百姓同在——尤其是在圣殿中，这敬拜祂的地方——那么，审判岂不也会临到祂自己吗？这岂能成就？在9至22节，我们得着答案。以西结看见，耶和华的荣光离开圣殿：“耶和华的荣耀从殿的门槛那里出去，停在基路伯以上。”（10:18）以色列的神正从圣殿——祂与百姓相会的地方——撤回祂的同在。

对于听见这预言的人来说，这无疑是极大的震惊。圣殿已经被毁，他们或许还在揣测：“难道神被击败了吗？”这异象的回答是：不是。神并非被打败，而是出于祂的圣洁，主动收回祂的保护。祂离开圣殿与圣城，使祂的百姓被攻陷、被掳掠。这就是审判临到的方式。

这段经文提醒我们，不要将我们信仰生活中的任何事物，当作一种护身符。以色列人可能以为，无论他们怎样行，圣殿总会安然无恙。但神并不是被某种“属灵魔力”捆绑在圣殿之中。祂在圣殿与百姓相会，完全是出于祂的恩典，而不是因为有什么永不能断的必然联系。当祂百姓的罪恶加深、刚硬不悔时，神就断绝这会面，让他们自食悖逆的后果。神对付罪是认真的。

> [!important]+ 反思与回应
因此，当我们向这位圣洁、荣耀的神祷告时，要感谢祂，因着耶稣基督，审判已经在我们身上止息。也求祂使我们单单倚靠基督——我们真正的圣殿——这位神永不离弃的救主。

### <center>Gone from the Temple</center>

> [!question]+ Review
> 1.⁠ ⁠Why did Ezekiel find the scroll “as sweet as honey” in his mouth? What was the source of this sweetness?
2.⁠ ⁠What difficulties and challenges did Ezekiel face when he was called to speak God’s words to the people of Israel?
3.⁠ ⁠Based on Ezekiel’s experience, how can we receive, internalize, and share God’s truth in our lives today?

📖 **Passage to read**: ==Ezekiel  10==

> [!info]- 🎙️Audio: [None]()  

In Ezekiel’s vision, we again see angelic beings and the strange, spinning wheels. They come with the glorious presence of God. Why does God show Ezekiel this vision again? It is to remind the prophet that God is personally and powerfully present in the judgment of his people. God commands one of the angels: “Fill your hands with burning coals from between the cherubim, and scatter them over the city” (10:2). The image continues in verses 6–8—fire held over the city, ready to fall. It is a clear picture of judgment—sure, consuming, and inescapable.

But here’s a question: if God is with his people—especially in the temple, the place of worship—would judgment fall on him too? Can that even happen? In verses 9–22 we get the answer. Ezekiel sees God’s glorious presence leaving the temple: “The glory of the LORD went out from the threshold of the house, and stood over the cherubim” (10:18). The God of Israel is withdrawing from the temple, the meeting place with his people.

For those who heard this prophecy, the shock would have been enormous. The temple was already gone, but they might have wondered, “Was God defeated?” This vision says no. God had not been beaten—he had chosen to remove his protection. In his holiness, he stepped back from the temple and the city, allowing his people to be conquered and carried away. This is how judgment came.

This passage warns us against turning anything in our Christian lives into a kind of good-luck charm. Israel may have thought the temple would always be safe, no matter what they did. But God is not tied to a building by magic. He met his people in the temple because of his grace, not because of some permanent link. When their sin grew deep and stubborn, he broke that meeting and let them face the results of their rebellion. God takes sin seriously.

> [!important]+ Reflect and Respond
When we pray to the holy and glorious God, we should thank him that in Jesus the judgment has ended for us. And we should ask him to keep our hope fixed on Christ—our true temple—that God will never leave.
