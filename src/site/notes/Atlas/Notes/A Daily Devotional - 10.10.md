### <center>无可否认的证据</center>

> [!info]- 🎙️Audio: [None]()


四卷福音书都告诉我们，连耶稣最亲近的门徒，也很难真正明白祂必定要从死里复活。约翰直白地说：“他们还不明白圣经的意思，就是耶稣必要从死里复活。”（20:9）然而，在本章中，我们看到情况逐渐转变。门徒们开始经历信心的萌芽，当他们亲身面对耶稣复活的事实时，他们看见了祂救赎工作的巅峰。约翰要我们清楚知道：耶稣确实复活了，是实实在在、带着身体的复活。

抹大拉的马利亚、彼得和约翰最先发现坟墓出了状况，却仍然不完全明白其中的意义。到了第10节，我们读到：“门徒便回自己的住处去了。”他们满心疑惑，不知所措。唯有马利亚仍然停留在墓旁。就在此刻，她遇见了复活的主。耶稣站在她面前，带来安慰与平安。她急忙跑去告诉门徒们：“我已经看见主了！”

随后，耶稣显现给所有的门徒。他们因惧怕犹太人而紧闭门窗，聚在一起。耶稣站在他们中间，把祂的钉痕手和被刺的肋旁给他们看。祂赐下平安，显明祂确已复活。然而，还有一位仍不信的人——多马。他因迟疑和怀疑而被称作“多疑的多马”。他直言，若不亲眼看见、亲手摸到耶稣的伤痕，他绝不相信。耶稣满有恩典，满足了多马的要求。祂让多马触摸祂的伤口，于是多马终于信了。

约翰要强调的重点十分清楚：那些困惑、惧怕、怀疑的人，一个个在复活的耶稣面前，都转向了信心。这些人并非轻易就会相信“不可能的事”。但当马利亚、多马和其余的门徒亲眼见到耶稣活生生地站在他们面前，听祂说话，甚至与祂同吃的时候，证据已无可否认。耶稣真实地胜过了死亡，唯一正确的回应就是信靠祂。

> [!important]+ 反思与回应
如今，这个问题也临到我们：你是否相信耶稣基督的复活？你是否确信在祂里面得着永生？你是否单单倚靠祂在十字架上的死与复活而得救？今天，就把这些问题带到神面前，在祷告中让你的信心再次因复活的基督而得坚固。

### <center>Undeniable Evidence</center>

> [!question]+ Review
> 1. What question did Pilate ask when examining Jesus, and what does this reveal about his attitude toward “truth”?
> 2. According to the passage, what were the contradictions in Pilate’s attitude toward Jesus? Why did he eventually hand Jesus over to be crucified?
> 3. What does this passage remind us about the only right response to Jesus? How can we move beyond “curiosity” and “fascination” to true faith and submission?

📖 **Passage to read**: ==John 20==

> [!info]- 🎙️Audio: [None]()  


All four Gospels tell us that Jesus’s own disciples had a hard time grasping that he was truly going to rise from the dead. John says it plainly: “They still did not understand from Scripture that Jesus had to rise from the dead” (20:9). But in this chapter, something begins to change. We start to see faith taking root as Jesus’s followers come face to face with the greatest act of his saving work—the resurrection. John wants us to see that the resurrection of Jesus really happened, in body and in truth.

Mary Magdalene, Peter, and John are the first to notice that something is different at the tomb. Yet they still don’t quite understand what it means. By verse 10, we read, “The disciples went back to their homes.” They were puzzled, unsure, and waiting. But Mary lingers. And to her comes the first appearance of the risen Lord. Jesus stands before her, speaking words of comfort and peace. She runs to tell the others, “I have seen the Lord!”

Later, Jesus comes to the whole group of disciples. They are hiding together behind locked doors, afraid of the Jewish leaders. Jesus shows them his wounded hands and side. He gives them peace and proof that he has truly risen. Still, one disciple refuses to believe—Thomas. Known to us as “doubting Thomas,” he boldly says he will never believe unless he sees and touches Jesus’s wounds for himself. Jesus, in grace, gives Thomas what he asks for. He lets Thomas touch him, and at last Thomas believes.

John’s point is clear. One after another, people who were confused, afraid, or doubtful turned to faith when they met the risen Jesus. These were not people quick to believe in something impossible. But when Mary, Thomas, and the other disciples saw Jesus alive, the evidence could not be denied. He was standing there. He was speaking to them. He was eating with them. Jesus had truly overcome death. The only right response was to believe.

> [!important]+ Reflect and Respond
So now the question comes to us: Do you believe in the resurrection of Jesus Christ? Do you trust that in him you have eternal life? Are you resting in his death and resurrection for your salvation? Take these questions to God today, and let your faith be renewed in the risen Christ.
