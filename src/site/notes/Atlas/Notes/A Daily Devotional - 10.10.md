### <center>约翰对十字架的见证</center>

> [!info]- 🎙️Audio: [None]()

四福音书都记载了耶稣的钉十字架。他们讲述同一件事，但每一位作者都有不同的角度。基本事实一致，却各有侧重。那约翰希望我们在他的记载中看见什么呢？

首先，约翰强调耶稣的死是旧约应验的实现。兵丁为祂的衣服拈阄，正如大卫在诗篇22篇所写。耶稣说：“我渴了”，约翰特别指出这也是为了应验圣经（19:28）。甚至士兵没有打断祂的腿骨，却用枪扎祂的肋旁，这一切都应验了旧约的见证。对约翰而言，这不是偶然，而是神的计划。十字架并非混乱无序，而是神的旨意在一步步成就。

其次，约翰让我们看到：即便在钉十字架的痛苦与羞辱中，仍有人开始信耶稣。亚利马太的约瑟，一位受人尊敬的犹太官长，出来请求领取耶稣的身体。他过去暗暗跟随，如今却公开表明信心。尼哥底母也出现了，你或许还记得他在第三章的故事。现在他也勇敢站出来，表明自己已信靠耶稣。

约翰甚至亲自插入自己的见证（19:35）：“看见这事的人已经作了见证，他的见证也是真的，并且他知道自己所说的是真的，叫你们也可以信。” 这就是约翰写作的目的：要你相信。要你看见这位被钉的主，并全然将信心放在祂身上。

> [!important]+ 反思与回应
让我们祷告，求神坚固我们对祂儿子耶稣的信心。祂为要成就神一切的应许，为我们舍命在十字架上。求神开启我们的眼睛，更深体会基督为我们所作的奇妙牺牲，并赐我们力量，一生跟随祂，承认祂为主。

### <center>John’s Perspective of the Crucifixion</center>

> [!question]+ Review
> 1. What question did Pilate ask when examining Jesus, and what does this reveal about his attitude toward “truth”?
> 2. According to the passage, what were the contradictions in Pilate’s attitude toward Jesus? Why did he eventually hand Jesus over to be crucified?
> 3. What does this passage remind us about the only right response to Jesus? How can we move beyond “curiosity” and “fascination” to true faith and submission?

📖 **Passage to read**: ==John 20==

> [!info]- 🎙️Audio: [None]()  

The four Gospels all tell us about the crucifixion of Jesus. They describe the same event, but each writer gives us a slightly different angle. The basic facts remain the same, but each has something unique to show us. So what does John want us to see as he tells the story of Jesus’s death?

First, John wants us to notice how Jesus’s death fulfills the Old Testament. The soldiers gamble for his clothing, just as David wrote in Psalm 22. When Jesus says, “I thirst,” John points out that this too fulfills Scripture (19:28). Even the piercing of Jesus’s side instead of breaking his bones fulfills God’s word. For John, this is no accident. He is telling us that every detail happens under God’s plan. The cross is not chaos; it is God’s design, carried out in perfect detail.

But John also shows us something else. Even in the pain and shame of crucifixion, some people start to believe in Jesus. Joseph of Arimathea, a respected Jewish leader, steps forward to claim Jesus’s body. He had followed Jesus quietly, but now he makes his faith known. Nicodemus also appears again. You may remember him from chapter 3. Now he too comes out into the light, showing that he believes in Jesus.

John himself adds his own voice to the story in verse 35: “He who saw it has borne witness—his testimony is true, and he knows that he is telling the truth—that you also may believe.” That is John’s goal. He wants you, the reader, to believe. To see the crucified Lord, and to put your whole trust in him.

> [!important]+ Reflect and Respond
Pray that God would deepen your faith in Jesus, the Son of God, who gave his life to fulfill all of God’s promises. Ask him to open your eyes to the wonder of Christ’s sacrifice for you, and to strengthen you to follow him as your Lord.
