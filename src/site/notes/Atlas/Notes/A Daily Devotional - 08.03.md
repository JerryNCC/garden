### <center>终极的仆人之歌</center>

> [!info]- 🎙️Audio: [None]()

当大卫在撒母耳记上第十七章中挺身而出迎战歌利亚时，这位非利士巨人并未将他放在眼里。歌利亚看见大卫，不过是个少年人，便嗤之以鼻（撒上17:42）。然而，大卫虽不显强壮或威武，却是神所拣选、要得胜仇敌的人。

以赛亚在他最后一首“仆人之歌”中，为我们描绘了类似的图画。这位仆人并不显得有能力，也不吸引人。他之所以蒙拣选，并不是因着外貌或魅力。事实上，正好相反。以赛亚说这位仆人是“被藐视，被人厌弃，多受痛苦，常经忧患。他被藐视，我们也不尊重他”（赛53:3）。那么，这位仆人若不是靠着外在的印象，那他到底是为何而来？

首先，以赛亚向我们显明，这位仆人的使命是“代替”。他取代了那些因罪当受审判的人。以赛亚说：“他为我们的过犯受害，为我们的罪孽压伤。因他受的刑罚，我们得平安；因他受的鞭伤，我们得医治”（赛53:5）。这位仆人甘愿代人受罚。他默然无声，被牵去宰杀之地，也不开口，为的是担当众人的罪（赛53:7）。

其次，以赛亚清楚指出，这代替的工作正是神救赎计划的核心。仆人的受苦不仅具有意义，更有功效。它真正成就了神的旨意——使多人得救。以赛亚说：“因他受的苦，他要看见自己劳苦的功效，便心满意足。有许多人因认识我的义仆得称为义，并且他要担当他们的罪孽”（赛53:11）。

这段经文清楚地指向耶稣基督——神的儿子。其他的预言也许只是暗示那将来的那一位；但这里却明明白白告诉我们他要做什么：他要藉着自己的受苦，救赎神的子民。

> [!important]+ 反思与回应
求神帮助我们，愿意跟随这位受苦的仆人，无论付上何等代价。也祷告我们能更珍爱耶稣——那为我们的罪舍己，使我们得以与神和好的救主。

### <center>Final Servant Song</center>

> [!question]+ Review
> 1. ⁠How was Babylon used by God to discipline the people of Israel, and what did they do wrong in the process?
> 2. In Isaiah 47, how does God's judgment on Babylon reveal His justice?
> 3. How does this passage remind us today to take sin and repentance seriously? How should we respond to God's justice and mercy?

📖 **Passage to read**: ==Isaiah 52:13-53:12==

> [!info]- 🎙️Audio: [None]()  

When David stepped out to fight Goliath in 1 Samuel 17, the big Philistine wasn’t impressed. Goliath looked at David and saw just a boy, and he mocked him for it (1 Sam. 17:42). But even though David didn’t look strong or threatening, he was God’s chosen one to win the fight.

Isaiah gives us a similar picture in the last of his four Servant Songs. The servant he describes doesn’t come across as powerful or attractive. He isn’t chosen because of his looks or charm. Actually, he’s the opposite. Isaiah says this servant is “despised and rejected by men, a man of sorrows and acquainted with grief; and as one from whom men hide their faces he was despised, and we esteemed him not” (53:3). So what is this servant really here for, if he’s not the impressive kind?

First, Isaiah shows us that this servant’s mission is all about substitution. He takes the place of people who deserve judgment for their sins. Isaiah says, “But he was pierced for our transgressions, he was crushed for our iniquities; upon him was the chastisement that brought us peace, and with his wounds we are healed” (53:5). The servant steps in and bears the punishment that others deserved. And he does it willingly. “He opened not his mouth,” Isaiah says, even as he’s led to his death for the sake of the people (53:7).

Second, Isaiah makes clear that this substitution is central to God’s plan. The servant’s suffering isn’t just meaningful—it’s effective. It actually accomplishes something. Through it, God will save many. Isaiah says, “By his knowledge shall the righteous one, my servant, make many to be accounted righteous, and he shall bear their iniquities” (53:11).

This passage points us clearly to Jesus Christ, God’s Son. Other prophecies may hint that someone is coming. But here, we’re told what he’ll do. He will rescue God’s people through his suffering.

> [!important]+ Reflect and Respond
Ask God to help you follow the suffering servant, no matter the cost. Pray that you would treasure Jesus, who gave himself for your sins so that you could be right with God.
