### <center>这样的心</center>

> [!info]- 🎙️Audio: [A Daily Devotional - 03.02 - CN]()

对于一个有小孩的父亲来说，最快乐的时刻之一，就是在辛苦工作一天后，看到自己蹒跚学步的孩子兴奋地迎接他。当父亲踏进家门的那一刻，孩子的脸上会绽放出灿烂的笑容！然而，遗憾的是，这种兴奋并不会永远持续下去。随着孩子长大，他们有时会变得不再那么喜欢和父母亲近，甚至会开始厌烦父母。父亲或许会心想：“为什么你不能像小时候那样，对我保持那种兴奋和热情呢？”

在《申命记》第五章中，摩西提醒神的百姓关于十诫的教训，同时也回顾了他们最初对神话语的反应。当他们第一次听见神的声音时，它是从山上的火焰中传出来的。人们被神话语的威力所震撼，并且深刻意识到神的圣洁、荣耀和伟大。百姓说道：“今天我们亲眼看见神与人说话，而人却仍然存活。我们为何还要死呢？因为这大火会吞灭我们。如果我们再听见耶和华我们神的声音，我们就必死。”（5:24-25）。他们的恐惧使得他们恳求摩西作为他们的中保，代替他们亲近神，听取神的话语，再将其传达给他们，好使他们能够遵行。

接着，神说：“但愿他们常存这样的心，敬畏我，遵行我一切的命令，使他们和他们的后代永远得福！”（5:29）。这与父亲对孩子的感叹何其相似！

神的话语和神的圣洁应当使我们心生敬畏和崇敬。它应当引导我们顺服神，并寻求一位中保——一个在我们与神之间代求的人。我们是罪人，不配亲近这位圣洁的神。因我们的罪，我们理应死亡。但神总是为他的百姓提供了一位中保——一个带领他们听神话语、帮助他们遵行并得以活着的代求者。

> [!important]+ 反思与回应
神的百姓在这段经文中的反应教导了我们很多。因为他们明白自己在罪中不能承受神的荣耀，他们请求摩西作为他们的中保。今天，我们可以感谢神，为我们提供了完美的中保——耶稣基督，祂的儿子。唯有信靠耶稣，方能得救，得赦免，并且通过祂与天父建立亲密关系。

### <center>Such a Heart as This</center>

> [!question]+ Review
> 1. ⁠Why does Moses connect obedience to God's word with life in his sermon? How does listening to and obeying God's word impact our lives?
> 2. ⁠How does Moses remind the people that the God they follow is different from the gods of other nations? Why is obeying God's word a privilege rather than a burden?
> 3. ⁠As you reflect on this passage, how should we view the opportunity to have God's word in our lives? How does it affect our daily lives?

📖 **Passage to read**: ==Deuteronomy 05==

> [!info]- 🎙️Audio: [A Daily Devotional - 03.02 - EN]()  

One of the most joyful moments for a father with a young child is when his toddler greets him with excitement after a long day of work. The moment he steps through the door, the toddler’s face lights up with a huge smile! But unfortunately, that excitement doesn’t always last forever. As children grow older, they sometimes become annoyed with their parents. The father might wonder, “Why can’t you keep that same enthusiasm for me that you had when you were younger?”

In Deuteronomy 5, Moses reminds God’s people of the Ten Commandments, but he also recalls their initial response to God’s word. When they first heard God speak, it came to them from the fire on the mountain. They were overwhelmed by the power of God’s word and the terrifying realization of His holiness, glory, and greatness. The people said, “This day we have seen God speak with man, and man still live. Now therefore why should we die? For this great fire will consume us. If we hear the voice of the LORD our God any more, we shall die” (5:24-25). They were so afraid that they asked Moses to be their mediator, someone who could approach God, hear His word, and bring it back to them so they could obey. 

Then, God says, “Oh that they had such a heart as this always, to fear me and to keep all my commandments, that it might go well with them and with their descendants forever!” (5:29). This is very similar to what a father might say about his child!

God’s word, along with His holiness, should move us to awe and reverence. It should lead us to obey Him and to seek a mediator—someone to stand between us and God. We are sinful and do not deserve to draw near to such a holy God. We deserve death because of our sin. But God has always provided a mediator for His people—someone to bring them His word and enable them to obey it, so they can live.

> [!important]+ Reflect and Respond
The response of God’s people in this passage teaches us a lot. They begged Moses to be their mediator because they understood they couldn’t handle God’s glory in the midst of their sinfulness. Today, we can thank God that He has provided the perfect mediator for us—Jesus Christ, His Son. Trust in Jesus alone for salvation, for forgiveness, and as the only way to have a relationship with God the Father.
