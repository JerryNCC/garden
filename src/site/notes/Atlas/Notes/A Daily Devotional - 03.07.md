### <center>谨守遵行祂的一切命令</center>

> [!info]- 🎙️Audio: [A Daily Devotional - 03.07 - CN]()

想象一下，一个小女孩伸手去碰炉灶上沸腾的蔬菜锅。那锅看起来非常诱人，沸腾着，色彩鲜艳。当她伸手去触碰时，她的父亲会迅速抓住她的手，严厉地说：“不行，那是烫的。”在那个瞬间，她可能会觉得父亲对她很苛刻，甚至不公平。但事实上，父亲是要保护她，他知道什么对她最好。

当我们阅读旧约前五卷书中的律法时，有时我们可能会觉得神像是一个过于严苛的父母，制定规则只是因为祂喜欢规则。但当我们阅读《申命记》28章时，我们看到神的律法并不是因为祂喜欢规则，而是因为祂爱祂的百姓。从创世记开始，神对祂百姓的旨意一直没有改变——祂想要赐福给他们。

在1-14节中，摩西列出了神的百姓如果“谨守遵行祂一切命令”（28:1），将会得到的祝福。他们会在家庭、牲畜、农作物和战争中蒙福。神将建立他们，使他们安居乐业，成为周围列国的光辉榜样。摩西说，这些祝福会降临在百姓身上，前提是他们忠实于神的话语，不去追随其他神明。然而，如果他们背离神的话语，咒诅将会随之而来。死亡、瘟疫、以及被敌国打败将成为他们的结局。神的律法并不是为了让生活更艰难，而是因为神知道，遵行祂的话语是百姓蒙福的关键，只有这样他们才能避开其他神带来的毁灭。

> [!important]+ 反思与回应
神呼召我们活在祂的话语之下！遵行祂的话语将带来祝福，但如果我们试图脱离祂的话语，咒诅就会随之而来——无论是在今生还是来世。今天花些时间祷告，求神帮助你按照祂的话语生活，永不偏离它，不让那些可能使你分心或诱惑你的事物把你带走。

### <center>Careful to Do All His Commandments</center>

> [!question]+ Review
> 1. ⁠Why does Moses remind the people in Deuteronomy 9 not to be proud of their own righteousness? What does this teach us about the only reason we enter the promised land by God's grace?
> 2. ⁠Moses reminds the people that they provoked God to anger and almost faced destruction, what warning does this give us? How should we reflect on our own attitudes and actions?
> 3. ⁠How can we avoid becoming prideful and thinking we deserve God's grace in our lives today? What steps can you take to continually remind yourself of God’s grace and love?

📖 **Passage to read**: ==Deuteronomy 28:01-24==

> [!info]- 🎙️Audio: [A Daily Devotional - 03.07 - EN]()  


Imagine a little girl reaching out her hand to touch a boiling pot of vegetables on the stove. The pot looks so inviting, bubbling and bright. But as she reaches for it, her father quickly grabs her hand and sternly says, “No, that’s hot.” In the moment, she might feel that her dad is being unfair or mean, but of course, he’s protecting her. He knows what’s best for her.

As we read through the laws in the first five books of the Old Testament, it can sometimes feel like God is an overly strict parent, giving out rules just because He likes them. But when we read Deuteronomy 28, we see that God’s laws are not about His love for rules but about His love for His people. God’s purpose for His people has always been the same, from the very beginning in Genesis. He wants to bless them.
 In verses 1-14, Moses lays out the blessings that will come to God’s people if they are “careful to do all his commandments” (28:1). They will be blessed in their families, their animals, their crops, and their battles. God will establish them and give them security, making them a shining example to the nations around them. These blessings will come, Moses says, if they remain faithful to God’s word and do not chase after other gods. But if they turn away, curses will follow. They will face death, disease, and defeat at the hands of enemy nations. The law isn’t about making life hard—it’s about God wanting what’s best for His people. He knows that the key to their blessing is living in obedience to His word, not following after other gods.

> [!important]+ Reflect and Respond
God calls us to live under His word! Obeying His word brings blessing, but if we try to live apart from it, curses will follow—whether in this life or the next. Take some time today to pray. Ask God to help you live according to His word, and never turn away from it to other things that might distract you or tempt you.
