你在这个故事中扮演什么角色？你从这段经文中可以得到什么主要的应用？你最能与哪些人物产生共鸣？在我们小时候的主日学里，我们常常被教导要将自己看作是大卫。我们被鼓励像大卫一样勇敢，像大卫一样信靠神，像大卫一样面对我们生命中的“巨人”。然而，事实上，我们可能一直是从错误的角度来看待这个故事。

首先，让我们考虑一下我们在圣经大故事中的位置。神的子民（以色列人）如今生活在神的应许之地——以色列，处在神的统治下，这个统治是通过人类的王来实行的，而这些王是被神的话语所引导的。那么，如果我们生活在大卫和歌利亚的时代，我们在这个故事中会是什么样的位置呢？我们会是普通的以色列人，过着平凡、日常的生活。在阅读旧约的故事时，问一个很有帮助的问题是：普通的以色列人当时在做什么？这正是我们在大卫和歌利亚故事中的位置。

人民感到恐惧。第11节告诉我们，当歌利亚——非利士人的冠军——站出来时，扫罗和所有的以色列人都充满了恐惧。他们站在那里，像被定住了似的，看着大卫挺身而出，去与这位强大的敌人对抗。大卫来见扫罗，请求他给自己与歌利亚作战的机会。大卫手中没有其他武器，只有一块石子和一条投石器，他带着勇气走向那个巨人，宣称他必定会以神的名义打败歌利亚。凭借神的力量，大卫获得了胜利，击败了歌利亚并砍下了他的头。歌利亚被打败后，人民才如梦初醒，发出欢呼声，加入了本已决定的战斗。

事实上，我们在这个故事中并不是大卫——耶稣才是！我们是那些惊恐、无助的以色列人，迷失在罪恶之中，急需一位冠军，一位救主。耶稣是神子民的冠军。他打败了罪恶、撒但和死亡。我们站在旁观的位置，看着他为我们死在十字架上，又从死里复活。然后，凭借他对我们的伟大爱，他邀请我们加入他的使命——将他的胜利带给世界。

> [!important]+ 反思与回应
感谢耶稣，因为他是我们的冠军。就像大卫一样，他为那些恐惧和无助的人打了这场战斗。如今，我们被呼召加入他的事业，把那因基督而得的救恩和宽恕传递给别人。

> [!question]+ Review
> 1. ⁠In 1 Samuel 16, why does Samuel initially think Eliab is the Lord's anointed? What lessons can we learn from this?
> 2. Why does God remind Samuel to look at the heart rather than outward appearance? How does this relate to the people's choice of Saul as king?
> 3. ⁠What does David's journey from shepherd to the palace reveal about God's plan and principles? How can this inform our faith journey today?

📖 **Passage to read**: ==1 Samuel 17==

Where do you fit into this story? What part can you take away as your main application? Which characters do you most relate to? Growing up in Sunday school, we were often taught to see ourselves as David in the story. We were encouraged to be brave like David, trust God like David, and face the “giants” in our lives just as David did. But, in reality, we’ve been looking at the story from the wrong angle.

Let’s first consider where we stand in the larger story of the Bible. God’s people, the Israelites, are living in God’s land, under God’s rule, which is carried out through human kings who are guided by God’s word. So, if we were living during the time of David and Goliath, where would we be in the story? We would have been ordinary Israelites, living regular, everyday lives. A helpful question to ask when reading Old Testament stories is this: What were the normal Israelites doing at the time? That’s where we find ourselves in the story of David and Goliath.

The people are afraid. Verse 11 tells us that when Goliath, the champion of the Philistines, stepped forward, Saul and all the Israelites were filled with fear. They stood there, paralyzed, watching as David took the step to fight this great enemy. David comes to Saul and asks for the chance to fight Goliath. Armed with nothing but a sling and a few stones, he marches boldly to face the giant. He declares that he will defeat Goliath in God’s name. With God’s strength, David wins the victory, killing Goliath and cutting off his head. After Goliath is defeated, the people finally rise up with a shout and join the battle, which is already decided.

The truth is, we’re not the David figure in this story—Jesus is! We are the frightened and helpless Israelites, lost in sin and in desperate need of a champion, a Savior. Jesus is the champion of God’s people. He fights and defeats sin, Satan, and death. We stand on the sidelines, watching Him as He dies on the cross and rises from the dead. Then, in His great love for us, our Champion invites us to join Him in His mission—to share His victory with the world.

> [!important]+ Reflect and Respond
Thank Jesus that He is our Champion. Just like David, He fought the battle on behalf of the terrified and helpless people. And now, we’re called to join His cause, telling others about the salvation and forgiveness that is found in Christ alone.
