### <center>我们服事，因为祂先服事</center>

> [!info]- 🎙️Audio: [None]()

每当我们读到这段经文，往往立刻想到应用。我们看见耶稣亲自为门徒洗脚，用最卑微、最谦卑的方式来服事他们。于是我们自然想到：这就是我们的榜样。我们也要去服事他人；要愿意跪下来关怀弟兄姊妹；要把他们的需要摆在自己之前；要乐意为他人承担卑微的事工；要更像耶稣！这一切固然正确，但却不是这段经文的核心。

仔细看约翰是如何开头的：“他既然爱世间属自己的人，就爱他们到底。”（13:1）洗脚这件事，正是祂爱到底的一部分——这份爱将祂带向十字架。然后我们看到彼得的反应：他抗拒，不愿接受。他深知自己是个有罪的人，理应为耶稣洗脚，而不是让耶稣服事他。但耶稣回答说：“我若不洗你，你就与我无分了。”（13:8）当然，耶稣后来也吩咐门徒，要效法祂的榜样去彼此相爱、彼此服事。然而，顺序很重要：耶稣必须先服事他们，先洗净他们，他们才能出去服事他人。

因此，这次洗脚并不是偶然的善行，也不是一时兴起的谦卑举动。它所指向的，是十字架。耶稣的死，要使祂的门徒从罪中得洁净。这就是经文的要义：在我们能够服事主之前，必须先被主拯救。祂必须先服事我们——在十字架上为我们的罪舍命。唯有如此，我们才能真正跟随祂，为他人舍己。

> [!important]+ 反思与回应
所以，当你在日常生活中谦卑地服事别人时，请记得背后的根源：你能这样做，是因为耶稣先服事了你。祂为你的罪而死，祂战胜了死亡。今天，让我们感谢神，因祂已先服事并拯救了我们。并且求祂赐下力量，使我们每天都能因十字架的缘故，去谦卑地爱人、服事人。

### <center>We Serve Because He Served</center>

> [!question]+ Review
> 1. Why did Jesus delay two days after hearing that Lazarus was sick? What does this reveal about his love and his plan?
> 2. In the miracle of raising Lazarus, what does Jesus show us about his identity and authority?

📖 **Passage to read**: ==John 13:01-20==

> [!info]- 🎙️Audio: [None]()  

When we read this passage, our first thought is often about application. We see Jesus washing his disciples’ feet in the most humble way possible. So, we say, this is our example. We should serve others. We should kneel before our brothers and sisters and care for them. We should put their needs ahead of our own. We should not despise small, humble acts of service. We should be more like Jesus! And all of that is true. But it is not the main point.

Look again at how John begins. He tells us, “Having loved his own who were in the world, he loved them to the end” (13:1). This act is part of that love—love that will take him all the way to the cross. Then we read Peter’s reaction. Peter resists. He knows he should be serving Jesus, not the other way around. But Jesus answers, “If I do not wash you, you have no share with me” (13:8). Yes, later Jesus says that this is an example for the disciples to follow. They should love and serve others humbly. But notice the order: Jesus must first serve them. He must wash them before they can go out and serve others.

The foot washing is not just a random act of kindness. It points directly to the cross. Jesus’s death will make his disciples clean from sin. That is the heart of the passage. John is telling us that before we can serve Jesus, we must be saved by Jesus. He must serve us first—on the cross, dying for our sins. Only then can we truly follow him and give our lives for others.

> [!important]+ Reflect and Respond
So, when you serve others humbly, remember why you can do it. You can serve because Jesus first served you. He died for your sins and broke the power of death forever. Thank God that Jesus has served you. And ask him to help you serve and love others each day—because of what he has done at the cross.
