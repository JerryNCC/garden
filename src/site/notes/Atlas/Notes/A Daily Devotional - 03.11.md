### <center>外邦女子拉哈布</center>

> [!info]- 🎙️Audio: [A Daily Devotional - 03.11 - CN]()

当神第一次呼召亚伯拉罕时，祂向他许下了祝福的应许——不仅是给亚伯拉罕，也给周围的所有列国。我们已经看到了这个应许如何在约瑟的故事中开始实现，神通过约瑟解梦救了埃及免于饥荒。现在，在《约书亚记》第二章中，我们看到这个应许又以另一种方式实现。这一次，神让一个完全的外邦人——拉哈布——找到了通向神的道路，并在神的百姓中获得了最大的祝福：祂的同在与恩宠。

约书亚在新的军事征战中，首先派出了两名间谍，去侦察耶利哥城，这是他们计划进攻的关键城市。间谍的任务是评估城市的强弱，做好入侵的准备。正是在这座外邦的耶利哥城，我们遇见了拉哈布。她不仅是外邦人，还是一名妓女，社会的边缘人物。在故事中的这一时刻，她似乎是神祝福的最不可能的候选人。拉哈布在所有意义上都是外人；她既不是以色列人，也未按照神的旨意生活。然而，正是这位女子，即将经历神的祝福——那同样是神向亚伯拉罕所应许的，赐给所有列国的祝福。

当拉哈布藏匿并帮助间谍时，她冒着巨大的风险。她背离了自己的民族和他们的神，选择站在以色列神和祂的百姓一边。她的话语完全表达了她的信心，她信靠唯一的真神：“你们的神耶和华，他是天上和地下的神” （2:11）。这是一句信仰的宣告。拉哈布不仅敬畏这位神，她愿意与神的百姓同在，为神的事业而战斗。

> [!important]+ 反思与回应
在这段《约书亚记》的故事中，我们看到一个惊人的画面——一位外邦妓女转向神，凭信心和顺服得救。就像拉哈布一样，你我也因耶稣基督的恩典被神接纳并蒙怜悯。请花些时间感谢神对你所施的恩典，并祈求神赐给你一颗充满怜悯的心，让你渴望看到失丧的罪人因耶稣的恩典进入神的家中。

### <center>Rahab the Outsider</center>

> [!question]+ Review
> 1. Why did Rahab take such a great risk in helping the Israelite spies? How does her action reflect her faith and determination?
> 2. What does Rahab's declaration, "The LORD is God in heaven above and on the earth below," mean for her life? How did this statement help her choose to side with Israel?
> 3. What lessons about God's mercy and acceptance can we learn from Rahab's story? How can you apply these lessons in your own life?

📖 **Passage to read**: ==Joshua 02==

> [!info]- 🎙️Audio: [A Daily Devotional - 03.11 - EN]()  


When God first called Abraham, He made a promise of blessing—not just to Abraham but to all the nations around him. We’ve already seen this promise begin to unfold through Joseph, who saved Egypt from famine by interpreting dreams God gave him. Now, in Joshua 2, we see another part of this promise coming true in a surprising way. This time, we see a complete outsider—Rahab—find her way to God and receive the greatest blessing of all: His presence and favor.

Joshua’s first move in the new campaign to conquer the land is to send two spies to scout out Jericho, the key city they plan to attack. Their task is to evaluate the city’s strengths and weaknesses as they prepare for the invasion. It’s in this pagan city, Jericho, that we meet Rahab. She’s not only a Gentile but also a prostitute, someone on the margins of society. At this point in the story, she’s as unlikely a candidate for God’s blessing as anyone could be. Rahab is an outsider in every sense of the word. She’s not part of Israel, and she’s living a life that goes completely against God’s commands. But it’s this very woman who will soon experience God’s blessing—the same blessing that God promised to Abraham for all nations. 

When Rahab hides the spies, she takes a huge risk. She turns against her own people and their gods. Instead, she chooses to align herself with the God of Israel and with His people. She speaks words that show her faith and trust in the one true God: “For the LORD your God, he is God in the heavens above and on the earth beneath” (2:11). This is a clear declaration of faith. Rahab doesn’t just fear God; she is willing to stand with God’s people and fight for His cause.

> [!important]+ Reflect and Respond
In this story from Joshua, we see an amazing picture of a Gentile prostitute who turns to God in faith and obedience and is saved. Just like Rahab, you and I have been shown mercy and accepted by God through Jesus Christ. Take a moment to thank God for His grace toward you, and pray that He would give you a heart full of mercy for outsiders, so that you would long for lost sinners to come into God’s family through the grace of Jesus.
