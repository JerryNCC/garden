### <center>惟有一条正路</center>

> [!info]- 🎙️Audio: [None]()

在学校里，要考砸一场考试有许多办法。你可以在考试那天翘课不去，或者整节课睡过去；你也可能把所有正确答案都写错地方；你甚至可能因为作弊被当场抓住。失败的方式可以有千百种。但要通过一场考试，却只有一条路：你必须答对题目。出错的路很多，真正得胜的路只有一条。

保罗在这封第一封写给提摩太的信快要结束时，就是要把这样一个观念深深刻在这位年轻牧者心里。保罗要他知道，在未来的日子里，人们会开始相信、也会传讲许多乱七八糟的东西——甚至是“鬼魔的道理”（4:1）。提摩太会遇上各样离经叛道的邪教、属灵滥用的现象，以及不少与圣经相冲突、荒诞古怪的教训。换句话说，人偏离耶稣基督真福音的道路会层出不穷！那么，提摩太该怎么办呢？难道他要去研究每一种异端？要对每一种出于鬼魔的教训和律法主义的倾向都极其熟悉，好一一拆解回应吗？答案是：绝不是。

保罗说，提摩太要紧紧抓住自己已经遵行的“那美好的教训”（4:6），继续忠心传讲福音。接受训练来分辨假钞的人，不是花时间去熟悉所有的假币，而是不断地看、不断地摸真钞，好叫自己一拿到假币，就立刻知道不对。同样地，提摩太要紧贴他从保罗那里领受的福音教导。保罗要他专心于在众人面前宣读圣经，在会众中劝勉、教导。对付假教训的办法，不是追着每一种错误去分析拆解，也不是和所有歪理邪说逐一辩论。事实上，保罗叫他对许多这类事情“弃绝不顾”。破解虚假的唯一答案，始终是神的话——不断回到福音的核心真理。提摩太，这位在信仰上作保罗“真儿子”的年轻人，所领受的托付，就是不断宣告耶稣基督是神的儿子，是罪人的救主。这信息本身就带着神的能力。

> [!important]+ 反思与回应
你也可以这样祷告：求神使你为着在这世界中生活所做的一切预备——面对形形色色奇怪的信仰、思想和教导——不是靠自己见多识广，而是扎根在那独一真确的耶稣基督的福音上。求神赐给你对祂话语更深的确信，并帮助你，无论在什么光景中，都勇敢而忠心地向人传讲祂的真理。

### <center>Only One Way</center>

📖 **Passage to read**: ==1 Timothy 04==

> [!info]- 🎙️Audio: [None]()  

There are lots of ways to fail a test in school. You can skip class on the day the test is given or sleep through the period. You can write all the right answers in the wrong spaces. You can get caught cheating. There is only one way to pass a test: you have to get the right answers. There are lots of ways to mess up; there’s only one way to succeed. 

This is the idea that Paul wants to leave with Timothy as he ends this first letter to him. Paul wants this young pastor to know that in the days to come, people will start believing and teaching all sorts of things—even the “teachings of demons” (4:1). Timothy will come across all kinds of crazy cults, spiritual abuses, and weird teachings that contradict Scripture. In other words, there are lots of ways that people will depart from the true gospel of Jesus Christ! So what is Timothy to do? Is he to study up on every false teaching? Become extremely familiar with every demonic teaching and legalistic impulse that threatens to enter the church? Absolutely not. 

Timothy, Paul says, is to hold tightly to the “good doctrine” that he has already followed (4:6). He is to keep on preaching the gospel! People who train to detect counterfeit money don’t waste their time becoming acquainted with the counterfeits; they study the real thing so that they can tell a fake bill immediately. In the same way, Timothy is to stick closely to the gospel teaching he has received from Paul. 

Paul wants him to devote himself to reading the Bible publicly and to exhortation and teaching. The answer to false teaching is not to chase down every one of those teachings and try to interact with them! In fact, Paul tells Timothy to have nothing to do with much of it. The answer to false teaching is always God’s word—going back to the core truths of the gospel. Timothy, Paul’s child in the faith, is charged to keep proclaiming Jesus Christ as the Son of God and the Savior of sinners. That is the message with God’s power behind it. 

> [!important]+ Reflect and Respond
Pray today that your preparation for life in this world—and all the strange teachings and beliefs that you will hear—will be to ground yourself in the one true gospel of Jesus Christ. Ask God to give you a greater conviction of the truth of his word. Ask him to help you commit to speaking his truth to others no matter what.
