### <center>第一批宣教士</center>

> [!info]- 🎙️Audio: [None]()


若你曾在教会群体中待过，你或许认识一些宣教士——那些离开家乡，前往异地分享福音的人。宣教事工一直是神救赎计划的重要部分，而在这段经文中，我们看见新约宣教运动的开端。《使徒行传》第十三章记载，圣灵吩咐教会差派保罗和巴拿巴——他们是第一批被差遣出去传福音的宣教士。

他们的旅程带他们来到皮西底的安提阿。安息日那天，他们进入犹太人的会堂聚会，被邀请发言。保罗起初回顾以色列的历史，提醒听众神在他们民族中所行的奇事。但当他讲到大卫王时，话锋一转，直接讲到耶稣。他宣告说：“从这人的后裔中，神照着所应许的，为以色列人立了一位救主，就是耶稣。”（徒13:23）

保罗的信息十分明确：**耶稣是理解整本圣经的关键。** 圣经中所有的应许、预言与盼望，都在祂里面成就。保罗引用诗篇中大卫的话，指出这些经文其实早已指向耶稣基督——那位降世为人的神儿子。

那麼，耶稣的降临为何对罪人来说是好消息呢？因为那位伟大的君王大卫死了并被埋葬，但神的儿子耶稣从死里复活，永远为王。保罗在讲道的结尾如此宣告：“所以弟兄们，你们当晓得，赦罪的道是由这人传给你们的；你们靠着摩西的律法不能得称义的，在这人里，凡信的都得称义。”（徒13:38–39）

这位“大卫的子孙”之所以伟大，是因为藉着祂的死与复活，神的子民得着完全的赦免与真正的自由。

如同往常一样，福音的信息引起了不同的回应。有人想听更多，有人信而欢喜。尤其是外邦人，他们听见自己也能因信耶稣基督成为神的子民，心中充满了喜乐。然而，也有一些犹太人因嫉妒而起来反对，煽动群众，把保罗和巴拿巴赶出城去。尽管如此，福音的信息仍继续传开，这两位宣教士也继续勇敢地传讲主的道。

> [!important]+ 反思与回应
今天，让我们祷告，求神重新点燃我们对福音的热情——那是带给失丧之人盼望与救恩的信息。也求主藉着《使徒行传》提醒我们，认识耶稣基督——这位复活的救主与永恒的君王——所带来的生命改变与属天喜乐。

### <center>The First Gospel Missionaries</center>

> [!question]+ Review
> 1. What happened to Saul on the road to Damascus, and how did it change the course of his life?
> 2. Why are Saul’s conversion and his call to preach the gospel so closely connected, and what does this teach us about our own faith today?
> 3. How does Saul’s story show us the transforming power of the gospel, and how should we respond to this grace that changes hearts?

📖 **Passage to read**: ==使徒行传 13.13-52==

> [!info]- 🎙️Audio: [None]()  

If you’ve spent time in a Christian community, you’ve likely met people who have left their homes to share the gospel in other countries. Missionaries have always been a vital part of God’s plan, and in this passage, we see where it all began. In Acts 13, the Holy Spirit tells the church to send out Paul and Barnabas—the first gospel missionaries in the New Testament.

Their journey takes them to a city called Antioch in Pisidia. On the Sabbath, they go to the synagogue, the gathering place for the Jews, and are invited to speak. Paul begins to recount the history of Israel, reminding his listeners of what God has done for His people. But when he reaches the story of King David, Paul moves quickly to Jesus. He says, “From this man’s descendants God has brought to Israel the Savior Jesus, as He promised” (13:23).

Paul’s message is clear: Jesus is the key to understanding all of Scripture. Every promise, every prophecy, every hope in Israel’s story points to Him. Quoting from the Psalms, Paul shows that even David’s words look ahead to Jesus Christ, the Son of God who came in the flesh.

Why is the coming of Jesus such good news for sinners? Because David, the great king, died and was buried—but Jesus rose from the dead and lives forever. Paul ends his sermon with this bold declaration: “Therefore, my friends, I want you to know that through Jesus the forgiveness of sins is proclaimed to you. Through Him everyone who believes is set free from every sin, a freedom you were not able to obtain under the law of Moses” (13:38–39).

This is what makes Jesus, the Son of David, so glorious—through His death and resurrection, God’s people can receive complete forgiveness and true freedom.

As always, the gospel message brings different responses. Some want to hear more. Some believe and rejoice. The Gentiles are especially filled with joy, realizing that through faith in Jesus, they too can be part of God’s family. But others, filled with jealousy, oppose the message and stir up persecution. They drive Paul and Barnabas out of the city, yet the gospel keeps spreading, and the missionaries keep preaching with courage.

> [!important]+ Reflect and Respond
Pray that God would renew your heart with the same passion for the gospel—the message of hope and salvation for those who are lost. Ask Him to remind you, through the book of Acts, of the power and joy that come from knowing Jesus Christ, the risen Savior and King of all God’s people.
