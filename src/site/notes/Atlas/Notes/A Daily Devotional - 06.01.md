### <center>瓦砾中的盼望</center>

> [!info]- 🎙️Audio: [A Daily Devotional - 06.01 - CN]()

瓦砾中的盼望——这不正是一个令人感到安慰的念头吗？即便经历了深重的哀痛与破坏，生命仍有可能迎来新的开始。以色列民在被掳多年后，如今归回耶路撒冷，是时候重新出发了——重建圣殿，也重建他们的生活。

这新的起点，从遵行神的律法开始。他们守住棚节，这是神早已命令的节期，只是在那些恶王统治的年代里，大概早已被人遗忘。如今，他们重新献上祭物，按着神的话语行事。这一切都在圣殿还未重建之前开始。随后，在所罗巴伯的带领下，重建的工程展开了。神的子民动工建殿，被敌人摧毁的一切，正在被他们重新修复。敬拜将重新归来，圣殿将再次屹立。在审判之后，神赐下怜悯——新的起点已然临到。

然而，接下来的发展却出人意料。在第十二节，我们看到一种复杂的情感交织在一起。当圣殿的根基被奠定时，并非人人都在欢呼。有人却在哭泣。是谁呢？是那些年长的一代。他们为什么哭？因为他们曾亲眼见过昔日所罗门所建的圣殿的荣耀。他们只需一眼，就知道这新的圣殿无法与那往日的辉煌相比。这一刻，他们的心碎了。他们虽然重回故土，却明白，所罗门王时代的荣光已一去不返。

即使是在这样充满盼望的时刻，我们也看见：物质的圣殿、地上的国度，终究无法成为神子民最终的归宿。这圣殿，纵然重要，却不能成为神子民永远敬拜祂的地方。它甚至无法比拟从前的荣耀。神的子民需要更美好的圣殿、更永恒的国度、一位完美无瑕的君王。

《以斯拉记》第三章向我们展现了更深的盼望。神正预备的，是远超过砖石之物的伟大救恩。祂所指向的，是祂自己的儿子。神不会停止带领祂的子民走向那真正的盼望。祂将赐下那最伟大的新起点——藉着耶稣在十字架上的牺牲，赦免我们的罪。

> [!important]+ 反思与回应
那么，请你思想：你真正的盼望，是不是在耶稣身上，而非属世之物？祂是否是你生命的君王，是你内心真正的渴望？在你今天来到神面前祷告时，不妨默想这些问题。

### <center>Hope amid Rubble</center>

> [!question]+ Review
> 1. Why did God not abandon Israel even though they had committed great sins? What does this teach us about our faith today?
> 2. King Cyrus's decree was a political act, but how does Ezra reveal God's sovereign hand behind it?
> 3. Ezra reminds us that exile is not the end. Have you seen in your own life how God brought hope and restoration even after times of failure or spiritual low?

📖 **Passage to read**: ==Ezra 03==

> [!info]- 🎙️Audio: [A Daily Devotional - 06.01 - EN]()  

Hope amid rubble. That’s a comforting thought, isn’t it? Even after deep sorrow and great loss, there’s still space for something new to begin. The people of Israel have come back to Jerusalem after years in Babylon. It’s time to start over—to rebuild the temple, and to rebuild their lives.

This new beginning starts with obeying God’s law. They celebrate the Feast of Booths, a festival God had commanded long ago, though it had likely been ignored during the time of the wicked kings. They begin offering sacrifices again, just as God instructed. And all this happens even before they start rebuilding the temple. Then, under the leadership of Zerubbabel, the rebuilding begins. God’s people get to work on the temple. The exile is coming to an end. What was torn down by enemies is now being restored by God’s people. Worship will return. The temple will stand again. After judgment, God brings mercy. A new beginning is here.

But then, something surprising happens. In verse 12, we see a strange mix of emotions. As the temple foundation is laid, not everyone is shouting with joy. Some are weeping. Why? It’s the older people—the ones who remember the first temple built by Solomon. When they see the new foundation, they realize something: this new temple won’t be anything like the old one. It won’t match its glory. And that breaks their hearts. They’re back in the land, yes, but they know the days of Solomon’s splendor are gone.

So even in a time of great hope, there’s a sense that this can’t be the full answer. This temple, as important as it is, isn’t the final place where God’s people will worship him forever. It won’t even compare to the past. God’s people need something better—something greater. They need a better temple, an everlasting kingdom, a perfect King.

Ezra 3 gives us a glimpse of something more. God is preparing something far bigger than bricks and stones. He’s pointing forward to salvation through his Son. God will not stop until he brings his people to that final hope. He will give them the greatest new beginning: the forgiveness of sins through Jesus' death on the cross.

> [!important]+ Reflect and Respond
So let me ask: is your hope in Jesus more than in anything on this earth? Is he the King of your life, the one your heart is longing for? Take time to think about that today as you come before God in prayer.
