### <center>耶稣——我们完美的大祭司</center>

> [!info]- 🎙️Audio: [None]()


“耶稣更美。”这是《希伯来书》的中心重点。作者关心的是向我们展示：耶稣基督——神的儿子——如何在各个时代，完全成就上帝向他子民所做的一切应许。他是真正更美、更完全的实底，旧约里所有的影儿、图画和记号，都是指向他。而希伯来书4:14–5:10则特别聚焦在：耶稣是神子民更美的大祭司。那么，耶稣怎样成为我们完美的大祭司呢？

**第一，耶稣是既作祭司、又是神自己的一位大祭司。**  
在旧约中，祭司是神子民的中保——在圣洁的神与有罪的百姓之间充当“中间人”，为他们献上祭物，带领他们敬拜，并通过教导引导他们。问题是，这些作祭司的人本身也是罪人！但耶稣不同。我们有一位大祭司——在我们与神之间的中保——是那位“已经升入高天尊荣里去的——神的儿子耶稣”（4:14）。为我们作中保的，正是神自己；对罪人来说，再也没有比这更好的中保了！

**第二，耶稣是完全为人的大祭司。**  
他既是神，并不意味着他不理解我们所经历的一切、以及我们受试探的处境。耶稣成了人；他知道我们的光景。《希伯来书》的作者这样说：“因我们的大祭司并非不能体恤我们的软弱；他也曾凡事受过试探，与我们一样，只是他没有犯罪”（4:15）。耶稣“走过”人世的道路——在这地上，走过我们所走的路。他能体恤像你我这样的破碎罪人！

**最后，耶稣是那位亲自成为赎罪祭的大祭司。**  
旧约的人间祭司要照着摩西律法，献上动物作为祭物。但耶稣却把自己献上，作那终极、完美的赎罪祭，为要把永远的救恩带给迷失的罪人。耶稣被神所立为救主，借着自己在十字架上的死，“就得以完全，凡顺从他的，就以他为永远得救的根源”（5:9）。我们不再需要任何其他的祭司；耶稣就是为我们完美的大祭司！

> [!important]+ 反思与回应
花一点时间思想：耶稣是你完美的大祭司。  
以赞美来回应他——他是至高的神，是创造世界的主。  
以感谢来回应他——他取了人的肉身，亲自来到这罪恶的世界。  
以信靠来回应他——他牺牲的死亡，已经为你得罪这位无限圣洁的神，付上最终的代价。  
求他帮助你只紧紧抓住他，单单以他作为你在神宝座前的中保与辩护者！

### <center>Jesus, Our Perfect Priest</center>

> [!question]+ Review
> 


📖 **Passage to read**: ==Hebrews 04:14-05:10=

> [!info]- 🎙️Audio: [None]()  

Jesus is better. That is the main point of the book of Hebrews. The author is concerned with showing us how Jesus Christ, God’s Son, is the perfect fulfillment of all God’s promises to his people for all time. He is the better reality, to which all the shadows, pictures, and signs of the Old Testament point. And Hebrews 4:14–5:10 focuses on Jesus as the better priest for God’s people. So how does Jesus perfect priesthood for us?

First, Jesus is a priest who is also God. In the Old Testament, the priests were mediators for God’s people—go-betweens for sinners who offered sacrifices and led them in worship and through teaching. The problem was that these human priests were sinners too! Not so with Jesus. We have a high priest—a mediator between us and God—who “has passed through the heavens, Jesus, the Son of God” (4:14). Our go-between is God himself; there is no better mediator for sinners!

Second, Jesus is a priest who is fully human. His divinity does not mean that he doesn’t understand what we go through and how we are tempted. Jesus became human; he knows our situations. Here’s how the writer of Hebrews puts it: “For we do not have a high priest who is unable to sympathize with our weaknesses, but one who in every respect has been tempted as we are, yet without sin” (4:15). Jesus has “been there”—on this earth, in our shoes. He can sympathize with broken sinners like you and me!

Finally, Jesus is a priest who is himself the sacrifice for sin. Human priests had to sacrifice animals, according to the law of Moses. Jesus, though, gives himself as the final, perfect, sacrifice for sin to bring eternal salvation to lost sinners. Jesus, appointed by God as the Savior, “became the source of eternal salvation to all who obey him” through his death on the cross (5:9). We do not need any other priest. Jesus is the _perfect_ high priest for us!

> [!important]+ Reflect and Respond
_Spend some time thinking about Jesus as your perfect priest. Praise him as the one who is God Most High—the Creator of the world. Thank him as the one who took human flesh and came near to this sinful world. Trust him as the one whose sacrificial death paid the final penalty for your sin against an infinitely holy God. Ask him to help you cling to him only as your mediator and advocate before God’s throne!_
