### <center>保罗在雅典</center>

> [!info]- 🎙️Audio: [None]()

纽约是一座举世闻名的大都会——充满活力、文化与影响力。你可能在街头转角就遇见明星、音乐家或知名人物。请想象这样的画面，再来读保罗进入雅典的故事。那时的雅典，同样是当世的文化中心，思想的摇篮。然而，他们的“名人”并非演员或歌手，而是哲学家、诗人与思想家。人们聚集在那里，辩论、讲论，追求新知。路加在《使徒行传》17章21节告诉我们：“雅典人和住在那里的客人都不顾别的事，只将新闻说说听听。”在这样的城市——充满好奇、渴求新意——保罗在亚略巴古发表了他那场著名的讲论。那里正是众人聚集、讨论与争辩的地方。

保罗深知自己的听众，并因地制宜地调整了讲道的起点与方式。他对外邦人所讲的，与对犹太人所讲的截然不同。当他向犹太人传讲耶稣时，他从亚伯拉罕开始，从神在以色列民族中的工作讲起——那是他们熟悉的故事。但对雅典人而言，这样的叙述毫无背景可循。因此，保罗换了一个切入点。

他从他们所熟悉的世界开始谈起。环顾这座城市，保罗注意到雅典人极其敬虔，到处是偶像，甚至还有一座祭坛，上面刻着“献给未识之神”。保罗便借此作为切入点，向他们宣讲那位他们所未知、却是创造天地万物的真神。他告诉他们，这位神不住在人手所造的殿中，也不受人手的服事，因为祂是赐人生命与气息的主。接着，保罗讲到神已设立一日，要借着祂所立的人——耶稣基督——审判世界。因这真理，保罗呼召雅典人悔改归向神。

然而，即便是伟大的使徒保罗，在这座充满思想与偶像的世界名城里，福音的结果依然参差不齐。有些人感到兴趣，有些人讥笑他，但也有少数人信了主耶稣。福音就是这样——即便在最黑暗、最异教的地方，也能结出果子。

我们同样可以从保罗身上学习。无论身处何地——不论是在繁华都市、宁静小镇，或任何地方——神都呼召我们智慧又忠心地传扬祂的真理。像保罗一样，我们要思想如何以人能懂的方式传讲福音，同时全然信靠那使人心改变的神。

> [!important]+ 反思与回应
祷告吧，求神赐你一颗热爱福音的心，使你更迫切地分享祂的真理。求祂帮助你像保罗一样，带着创造力与勇气，在人所在之处传讲耶稣基督的真道；也求祂教你安息在祂的能力中，相信唯有祂能使人回转归向祂。

### <center>Paul in Athens</center>

> [!question]+ Review
> 1. What was the main controversy the early church faced in Acts 15, and what did some Jewish teachers claim Gentile believers needed to do to be saved?
> 2. How did Peter, Paul, and Barnabas respond to these teachings, and what central truth of the gospel did their response emphasize?
> 3. In what ways might people today fall into the same trap of thinking we need “Jesus + something else” to be saved? How does this message remind you to rely on Christ alone?

📖 **Passage to read**: ==使徒行传 17:16-34==

> [!info]- 🎙️Audio: [None]()  

New York City is a global crossroads—a place full of energy, culture, and influence. You might walk down a street and see famous actors, musicians, or leaders. Picture that kind of setting when you think of Paul arriving in Athens. It too was a world-class city, alive with culture and ideas. But the celebrities of Paul’s day weren’t movie stars; they were philosophers, poets, and thinkers. People came there to debate, to lecture, and to discuss new ideas. Luke even tells us in Acts 17:21 that the Athenians “spent their time in nothing except telling or hearing something new.” It was in this kind of place—curious, restless, always learning—that Paul preached his next sermon at the Areopagus, the very center of discussion and argument.

Paul understood his audience and shaped his message for them. He didn’t use the same approach with the Athenians that he used with Jewish listeners. When he spoke to Jews, Paul started with Abraham, the law, and God’s work through Israel—stories they already knew well. But to the Gentiles in Athens, that kind of story meant little. They had no background in the Old Testament. So Paul began elsewhere.

He started from what they already knew. As he walked through Athens, he noticed their many idols and even one altar that read, “To an unknown god.” Using that as a bridge, Paul began to tell them about the one true God—the Creator of the universe, who made everything and everyone. He explained that this God cannot be contained in temples or controlled by human hands. Then he moved toward the heart of the message: one day, God will judge the world through His Son, Jesus Christ. Because of that coming day, Paul called the Athenians to repent and believe.

Even in this famous city, Paul’s message met with mixed responses. Some people were curious. Others mocked him. But a few believed and followed Christ. That’s how the gospel often works—it bears fruit, even in the hardest places. Athens was full of idols, yet even there, the good news found a home in a few hearts.

We can learn from Paul’s example. Wherever we are—whether in a city, a small town, or somewhere in between—God calls us to share His truth wisely and faithfully. Like Paul, we must think carefully about how to speak the gospel in ways people can understand, while trusting that God alone brings the results.

> [!important]+ Reflect and Respond
Pray that God would give you a deep love for the gospel and a growing desire to share it. Ask Him to make you creative and courageous in speaking the truth of Jesus to those around you, and to help you rest in His power to change hearts.
