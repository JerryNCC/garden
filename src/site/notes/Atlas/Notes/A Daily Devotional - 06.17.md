### <center>环境不能改变神</center>

> [!info]- 🎙️Audio: [A Daily Devotional - 06.17 - CN]()


撒但还未罢休。他再一次来到神面前，提出另一个控告：“以皮换皮”（约伯记2:4）。意思是：约伯尚未遭受肉身的打击；若是剥夺他的健康，撒但断言，约伯终将当面弃掉神。于是，神再次允许撒但试炼约伯，只吩咐不可取他的性命。

接下来的景况令人心碎——约伯从脚掌到头顶，长满了毒疮。他无处得着安慰，只得坐在炉灰中，用一块瓦片刮自己那发痒灼痛的皮肤。他的光景，已落到极卑微。然而，更沉重的是，连他的妻子也承受不了这一切的苦难。她失去了对神的信心，转而劝约伯也如此行：“你仍然持守你的纯正吗？你弃掉神，死了吧！”（约伯记2:9）

但约伯并没有照她的话去做。他没有咒诅神，也没有离弃信仰。相反，在这至暗之中，他的信心愈发显明。他回答妻子：“难道我们从神手里得福，不也受祸吗？”（约伯记2:10）虽然景况悲惨，约伯的心却仍旧倚靠神。

我们大多数人未曾经历像约伯那样的苦难。有些人可能失去了财物，有些人尝过疾病之苦，有些人深陷哀伤之中。但若连你最亲密的人也在患难中放弃信仰，劝你弃绝神，那将是多么黑暗绝望的光景！约伯就是在那样的处境中，仍然持守对神的信心。他在悲伤中宣告：神的旨意依然良善。

约伯的信心，并非建立在眼前的顺境，而是建基于他所认识的神——那位本为善、本为智慧、永不改变的神。即使在痛苦之中，他仍然相信神的美意与主权。

这时，约伯的三位朋友登场了——以利法、比勒达和琐法。他们听闻约伯遭难，千里迢迢前来安慰他。然而，很快我们就会发现，他们并非称职的安慰者。他们无法明白，怎会有一位公义的神，竟容许义人遭受如此苦难？

> [!important]+ 反思与回应
让我们求告神，赐我们一颗像约伯一样的心——不是因环境顺利而赞美神，而是因神本身配得敬拜。我们的主耶稣已经为我们受死并从死里复活，这是永不改变的真理。我们的神，也永远不改变。

### <center>Circumstances Don’t Change God</center>

> [!question]+ Review
> 1. Why did Job choose to worship God even after losing all his possessions and children in a single day? What does this reveal about his faith in God?
> 2. ⁠How did Satan question Job’s motives for faith? Why did God allow Satan to test Job?
> 3. Have you ever doubted God’s goodness in times of suffering? What can you learn from Job’s response about trusting God?

📖 **Passage to read**: ==Job 02==

> [!info]- 🎙️Audio: [A Daily Devotional - 06.17 - EN]()  

Satan isn’t finished with Job. He comes back to God with another accusation. “Skin for skin,” he says (2:4). What he means is this: Job hasn’t been touched in his body yet. Take away his health, Satan argues, and Job will finally curse God. So, once again, God allows Satan to test Job, this time sparing only his life.

What follows is hard to read. Job is struck with painful sores from head to toe. He can’t find relief. He sits in ashes and uses a broken piece of pottery just to scrape his skin. That’s how low he has fallen. But it gets worse. Job’s wife—perhaps overwhelmed by all that’s happened—tells him to give up. “Curse God and die,” she says (2:9). She’s lost hope. And now, Job stands alone.

But Job doesn’t curse God. He doesn’t walk away. Even in that moment, his faith holds. He reminds his wife—and himself—that God is still in control. “Shall we receive good from God, and shall we not receive evil?” (2:10). Job’s circumstances are awful, but his heart still trusts God.

Most of us haven’t faced suffering like Job’s. Some may have lost wealth or health. Some may know deep grief. But what if your loved ones also gave up on God? What if, in your darkest moment, those closest to you asked you to turn away from the Lord? That’s where Job is. And yet, that’s where his faith shines the brightest.

Job’s trust in God isn’t based on what life looks like. It’s based on who God is. Even in sorrow, Job believes God is good, wise, and sovereign.

And then, his friends arrive—Eliphaz, Bildad, and Zophar. They’ve heard about his suffering and come to comfort him. As we’ll see later, they don’t do a great job. They struggle to understand how a good God can let this happen to a faithful man.

> [!important]+ Reflect and Respond
So let’s pray for hearts like Job’s—hearts that worship God not because life is easy, but because God is worthy. Jesus has died and risen for us. That never changes. And neither does God.
