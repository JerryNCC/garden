### <center>从坑中到奴隶的命运</center>

> [!info]- 🎙️Audio: [A Daily Devotional - 01.25 - CN]()

你或许听过这样一句话：“这事传家。”无论是竞争心、幽默感，还是才华，许多性格特征，无论好坏，都会代代相传。对于雅各的家族来说，偏爱与兄弟间的纷争似乎成了家族传统。在创世记第37章中，我们看到雅各比其他儿子更爱他的儿子约瑟。事实上，雅各为约瑟赠送了一件特别的礼物——一件美丽、装饰华丽的外衣。正如你所料，约瑟的哥哥们对这一切毫不满意，他们对父亲的怨恨转化为对约瑟的仇恨。

更糟糕的是，约瑟并没有让局势变得更好。他与兄弟们分享了自己的梦境，梦中暗示有一天他的全家都会向他俯首称臣。显然，约瑟的哥哥们对此并不感到高兴，嫉妒之情更加深重。

局势在雅各将约瑟派去查看兄弟们的工作时达到了顶点。兄弟们已经心怀怒火，他们看到了一个可以摆脱约瑟的绝佳机会。他们计划杀掉他，把他的尸体丢进坑里。长子流便劝说他们放过约瑟，索性只是将他丢入坑中，打算稍后将他救出。但当流便离开时，其他兄弟改变了主意，决定将约瑟卖给一队前往埃及的以实玛利人商人。章节最后，约瑟被带到埃及，成为了一名波提乏的家奴，波提乏是守卫队长。

此时，约瑟处于最底层——在异乡为奴。然而，即便身处如此困境，他依然保持信心，更重要的是，神依旧忠实于他。神在他的生命中每一处都在工作，既是为了他的好，也是为了神的百姓的好。

> [!important]+ 反思与回应
约瑟的日子无疑比我们任何一天都更加艰难！然而，尽管他身处黑暗的境地，他依旧没有放弃对神的信靠，神也没有离弃他。约瑟或许还不知道，但神正是通过这一切痛苦，带来更大的目的——这个目的将最终为约瑟和神的百姓带来极大的益处。祈求神帮助你相信，祂正在按照完美的计划，为神的百姓成就一切，哪怕在你看不见的时候（罗马书 8:28）。

📖 **Passage to read**: ==Genesis 37==

> [!info]- 🎙️Audio: [A Daily Devotional - 01.25 - EN]()

You’ve probably heard the saying, “It runs in the family.” Whether it’s competitiveness, humor, or talent, many traits, both good and bad, get passed down through generations. For Jacob’s family, favoritism and sibling rivalry seem to be a family tradition. In Genesis 37, we see that Jacob loves his son Joseph more than his other sons. In fact, Jacob gives Joseph a special gift—a beautiful, richly ornamented coat. As you might expect, Joseph’s brothers do not take kindly to this, and their resentment toward their father turns into hatred for Joseph.

It doesn’t help that Joseph isn’t exactly making things easier for himself. He shares dreams with his brothers that suggest a time will come when his entire family will bow down to him in respect. Needless to say, Joseph’s brothers are not thrilled about this, and their jealousy deepens.

The situation reaches a boiling point when Jacob sends Joseph to check on his brothers, who are working with his father’s flocks. The brothers, already angry, see this as the perfect chance to get rid of Joseph. They plan to kill him and throw his body into a pit. Reuben, the oldest, persuades them to spare Joseph’s life and instead just throw him into the pit, hoping to rescue him later. But when Reuben is away, the brothers change their minds and sell Joseph to a group of Ishmaelite traders heading to Egypt. The chapter ends with Joseph arriving in Egypt as a slave in the household of Potiphar, the captain of the guard.

Joseph is now in the lowest possible position—enslaved in a foreign land. But even in this dire situation, he remains faithful, and more importantly, God remains faithful to him. God is at work, orchestrating every detail of Joseph’s life for his good and for the good of God’s people.

> [!important]+ Reflect and Respond
Joseph’s day was certainly much worse than any of ours! Yet, even though he is in an incredibly dark place, he does not lose faith in God, and God does not abandon him. Joseph may not realize it, but God is using this horrible day for a greater purpose—a purpose that will bring about ultimate good for Joseph and for God’s people. Ask God to help you trust that He is working all things together for the ultimate good of His people, even when you don’t see it (Romans 8:28).
