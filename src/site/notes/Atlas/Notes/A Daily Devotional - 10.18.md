> [!question]+ 回顾昨天的内容
> 1.  亚拿尼亚和撒非喇的罪，不在于他们没有奉献全部的钱财，而在于他们对上帝说谎。  ——从这件事中，你看见上帝怎样看待“动机”和“诚实”的重要性？
> 2. 这段经文显示上帝对祂教会的圣洁有多么在意。  ——在今日的教会生活中，我们该如何保持属灵的真诚与纯净？

### <center>扫罗使福音分散</center>

> [!info]- 🎙️Audio: [None]()


《使徒行传》第七章的结尾，出现了一个后来举足轻重的名字——扫罗。那位忠心的主仆司提反被石头打死时，扫罗就站在那里，默许这一切的发生。他认同这场暴行。进入第八章，我们看见扫罗真正的动机：他发动了一场猛烈的逼迫，向所有信奉耶稣的人开战。司提反之死只是序幕；扫罗正要展开更大的行动。他挨家挨户搜捕信徒，把他们拖进监牢，只因为他们承认耶稣的名（8:3）。他以为自己是在为神大发热心，却不知自己正敌挡神的计划。

然而，正是在这黑暗的时刻，我们看见神奇妙的作为。全能的神使逼迫反成了福音扩展的契机。扫罗本想摧毁教会，神却用这逼迫把信徒们分散到犹太和撒玛利亚各处，使福音随他们一同传开。人的手要堵住神的话语，但神的旨意却更显大能。教会虽被逼迫，却更加兴旺；信徒虽被驱散，却处处结出福音的果子。这正是神救赎计划中那令人惊叹的反讽——人意欲灭亡的事，神却用来成全生命。

路加在这里举了一个鲜明的例子——腓利的事奉。腓利来到撒玛利亚，面对那地盛行的邪术与虚假信仰，勇敢宣讲基督，许多人信了主。随后，圣灵又引导他走向一条荒凉的旷野路——从耶路撒冷往迦萨的路上，他遇见一位埃提阿伯太监。那人正读以赛亚先知书，腓利便向他讲解：耶稣就是那位受苦的仆人。那太监当即信主，并在旷野中受洗。洗礼之后，腓利被圣灵提去，继续走遍各城传扬福音。

亲爱的弟兄姊妹，《使徒行传》的故事充满了这样的神迹与惊奇。神藉着逼迫使福音向外扩展；而更令人震惊的，是神接下来要做的事——祂要亲自寻见那位逼迫者扫罗，使他成为传扬恩典的使徒。神的旨意无人能阻，祂的福音无人能灭。即便仇敌起来攻击，仍不过成就祂永恒的计划。

> [!important]+ 反思与回应
让我们一同赞美这位掌权的主。感谢祂在苦难中引导福音遍传犹太和撒玛利亚，也感谢祂那不变的慈爱，临到司提反、扫罗，更临到我们。神的手永不失败，祂的怜悯直到永远。

### <center>Saul Scatters the Gospel</center>

> [!question]+ Review
> 1. Ananias and Sapphira’s sin was not withholding money, but lying to God.  What does this teach you about how seriously God views our motives and honesty?
> 2. This passage shows how deeply God cares about the purity of His church.  How can we maintain spiritual sincerity and holiness in today’s church life?
> 3. God values the heart more than outward appearance.  Have you ever focused more on looking “spiritual” than truly worshiping Him in your heart?  How would you like to respond to God today?

📖 **Passage to read**: ==使徒行传 08==

> [!info]- 🎙️Audio: [None]()  

Acts 7 ends with a name that soon becomes central in the story—Saul. As Stephen, the faithful servant of Jesus, is stoned to death, Saul stands nearby, giving silent approval. He agrees with what is happening, and as Acts 8 begins, we learn what Saul is after. He begins a campaign of persecution against all who follow Jesus. What started with Stephen’s death now turns into a violent movement. Saul goes from house to house, dragging off men and women, throwing them into prison—all because they confess the name of Jesus (8:3). Stephen’s death was only the beginning. Saul is just getting started.

But here we see something remarkable about the God we worship. In his wisdom and sovereignty, God turns this tragedy into triumph. The persecution that Saul helps to lead becomes the very means by which the gospel spreads. As believers are scattered across Judea and Samaria, they carry the message of Jesus with them. The church is pressed, but it grows. The gospel is opposed, but it advances. What Saul intends for destruction, God uses for salvation. This is the beautiful irony of God’s plan.

Luke gives us one example through the ministry of Philip. Philip goes to Samaria, a place marked by confusion and false teaching. There he proclaims Christ with power, and people believe. Later, God sends him to a desert road between Jerusalem and Gaza, where he meets an Ethiopian official reading the prophet Isaiah. Philip explains that Jesus is the suffering servant Isaiah described. The man believes, is baptized right there in the desert, and goes on his way rejoicing. Philip is then carried by the Spirit to another town, preaching the same good news wherever he goes.

Friend, Acts is a story full of such surprises. God uses persecution to spread his Word. And soon, he will take the greatest persecutor of all—Saul—and make him the greatest preacher of grace. God’s purposes cannot be stopped. His gospel will not be silenced. Even those who fight against him end up serving his plan.

> [!important]+ Reflect and Respond
Take time to praise God for this. Thank him that his sovereign hand guided the gospel to Judea and Samaria through suffering. And thank him that his love still reaches sinners—Saul, Stephen, and us alike. The Lord’s plan stands firm, and his mercy never fails.
