### <center>君王耶稣</center>

> [!info]- 🎙️Audio: [None]()

想象一下：成千上万的人聚集在城里的街道上，目光都投向那宏伟的石制阳台。忽然，号角齐声吹响，声音庄严而激昂。你会期待看到谁出现在那阳台上呢？当然是一位君王。

马太福音的开头，正是如此。马太以家谱开始他的记载，在我们看来似乎有些奇怪，甚至无聊。但在当时，普通人并没有家谱，唯有君王需要它来确认自己的合法地位。君王的血统是他统治的凭据。因此，马太在开篇就清楚无误地告诉我们：这故事所要讲述的，是一位君王。

而且，马太并没有刻意掩盖神子民的失败与罪恶。看看大卫吧。马太写道：“大卫从乌利亚的妻子生所罗门”（马太福音1:6）。这一句话就让我们想起大卫的罪——他夺取别人的妻子，并设计害死乌利亚。耶稣的家谱里充满了罪人，甚至包括君王。从一开始，马太就要我们看见：耶稣来是为了解决神子民最大的难题——罪。

再看这里提到的另一位人物——摩押女子路得。她不是犹太人，而是外邦人。而且，她是一位女性，却被记在一份几乎全是男人名字的名单中。马太要我们明白：神的计划从来不局限于某一个民族或群体。祂的恩典临到各种人。与神的关系，从来不在乎出身，而在乎信心。

最后，再留意这家谱的结构。马太将它分为三个部分：从亚伯拉罕到大卫，从大卫到被掳巴比伦，从被掳到耶稣。可是这里少了什么呢？这份家谱并没有追溯到始祖亚当，也没有从耶稣延续到我们。为什么？因为马太要我们看见，耶稣就是关键的转折点。祂是那位开启神救赎历史最后一幕的君王。从亚伯拉罕到大卫，从大卫到被掳，再从被掳到耶稣——一切都指向祂。而如今，我们正活在这最后一幕中，只等祂再来。

> [!important]+ 反思与回应
所以，让我们俯伏在这位君王面前。耶稣是满有恩典的君王，祂不仅来作王掌权，更是来拯救。祷告祂坚固你的信心、盼望与信靠。感谢祂赐下我们真正所需要的君王。

### <center>King Jesus</center>

> [!question]+ Review
> 1.⁠ ⁠How does Malachi describe the coming of “that day”? What will happen to the arrogant and evildoers, and what will happen to those who fear God?
2.⁠ ⁠Which prophet did God promise to send before “the great and awesome day of the Lord”? What is the significance of this sign?
3.⁠ ⁠How is Malachi’s prophecy fulfilled in the Gospel of Luke? What role does John the Baptist play in it?

📖 **Passage to read**: ==Matthew 01:01-17==

> [!info]- 🎙️Audio: [None]()  

Picture this: thousands of people crowd into the city streets, their eyes fixed on a grand stone balcony. Suddenly, the trumpets sound with power and excitement. Who would you expect to step out onto that balcony? A king.

Matthew begins his gospel in a similar way. He starts with a genealogy, which might seem like an odd or boring beginning to us. But in his time, genealogies weren’t common for ordinary people—they were for kings. A king’s lineage confirmed his right to rule. So Matthew’s opening words are sending us a clear message: this story is about a king.

And there’s more to see here. Matthew doesn’t try to polish the record or cover up the failures of God’s people. Take David, for example. Matthew says, “David was the father of Solomon by the wife of Uriah” (1:6). That one phrase reminds us of David’s sin—how he took another man’s wife and arranged his death. The genealogy of Jesus includes sinners, even kings. From the very start, Matthew is pointing us to the reason Jesus came: to deal with the problem of sin.

But notice also who else appears here. Ruth, a Moabite woman, is mentioned by name. She was a Gentile, not a Jew. And she was a woman, in a list that is mostly male. Even in this list of names, God is showing us that he works through all kinds of people. His plan has always been bigger than one nation or one group. Faith in him—not background or heritage—has always been what matters.

Finally, look at the structure. Matthew lays out three sections of fourteen generations each: from Abraham to David, from David to the exile, and from the exile to Jesus. Something is missing here, though. The genealogy doesn’t go all the way back to Adam, the first man, and it doesn’t continue from Jesus to us. Why? Because Matthew wants us to see that Jesus is the turning point. He is the King who begins the final act in God’s story. From Abraham to David to exile to Jesus—it all leads here. And now, we are living in the last chapter, waiting only for his return.

> [!important]+ Reflect and Respond
So, let us bow our hearts before this King. Jesus is the gracious King who came not only to reign but also to save. Pray that God would strengthen your faith, your hope, and your trust in him today. Thank him for giving us the King we need.
