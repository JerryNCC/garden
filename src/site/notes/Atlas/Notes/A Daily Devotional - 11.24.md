### <center>属灵的导师</center>

> [!info]- 🎙️Audio: [None]()

你一生中有没有遇到过这样的一个人：他（或她）把你带在身边，一点一滴地教你、带你走路？也许是教练、老师，或是音乐指导。若你曾有过这样的导师，你必定不会轻易忘记他（她）教导你的许多事情。你的人生会被这样的影响深深烙印。一位好的导师，会帮助你、训练你、提醒你、挑战你，更会把你引向基督。

保罗就是提摩太的导师。他甚至称提摩太为自己在信仰上的“真儿子”（1:2）。这时，提摩太是一位在以弗所牧会的年轻传道人，已经被保罗长期栽培、训练。如今他却正经历在教会中服事、带领一群软弱、有罪之人的各种艰难与压力。提摩太前书是我们所谓“教牧书信”中的第一卷——是保罗写给初代教会领袖，教导他们如何看守并牧养基督群羊的书信。那么，保罗会先对这个“信心儿子”说什么呢？

保罗要提摩太紧紧抓住那真正的福音。这也是他在两封写给提摩太的信中反复强调的核心：要提摩太信这福音、传这福音、活出这福音，并守护福音的纯正。耶稣基督的真福音——祂为我们的罪而死，又从死里复活——在这世上必然不断遭受反对。因此，保罗在书信一开始，就这样吩咐这位他所培育的年轻同工：“要仍住在以弗所，好嘱咐那几个人不可传异教”（1:3）。提摩太，这位保罗属灵的门生，已经领受了他的托付：不可让任何人与真福音之外的教训在教会中立足。

> [!important]+ 反思与回应
由此开头，我们就看见一件事：教导何等重要。保罗不容许任何偏离真理的信息在教会中占据位置；他所要守住的，是惟独那真正的教义——耶稣基督的福音。那你呢？你是否刻意把自己放在能听见健全、合乎圣经教导之处？你是否也常被这个世界中那些与福音真理相对立的信息吸引、摇动？求神帮助你，像提摩太一样，立志守护真理，忠于圣经所启示、惟靠耶稣基督得救的福音。也求主使用你，使你在这个世代成为一位忠心见证祂儿子的见证人。

📖 **Passage to read**: ==1 Timothy 01:01-11==

> [!info]- 🎙️Audio: [None]()  

Have you ever had someone in your life who walked beside you and showed you how to live? Someone who didn’t just tell you what to do, but stayed with you, step by step? Maybe it was a coach, a teacher, or a music instructor. If you’ve had a person like that, you don’t forget them easily. Their words stay with you. Their example shapes you. A wise mentor can correct you, encourage you, stretch you, and, most importantly, keep pointing you to Christ.

That’s what Paul was to Timothy. He calls Timothy his “child in the faith” (1:2). Timothy is a young pastor in Ephesus. Paul has poured into him, taught him, and now Timothy is facing the real struggles of leading a church full of sinners with real problems. First Timothy is the first of the “Pastoral Epistles”—letters in which Paul shows early church leaders how to care for and protect Christ’s people. So what will Paul say first to this young man he loves?

Paul wants Timothy to cling to the true gospel. That runs through everything Paul writes to him. He wants Timothy to believe the gospel, preach the gospel, live the gospel, and protect the gospel. The true good news of Jesus—his death for our sins and his resurrection from the dead—will always meet resistance. So Paul opens this letter with a clear command: “Remain at Ephesus so that you may charge certain persons not to teach any different doctrine” (1:3). Timothy, Paul’s student and partner, has his assignment: do not allow any teaching that departs from the gospel of Jesus Christ.

> [!important]+ Reflect and Respond
So, teaching really matters. That is what we see at the start of 1 Timothy. Paul refuses to tolerate any message that twists or replaces the true doctrine—the gospel of Christ. Where are you placing yourself? Are you sitting under sound, biblical teaching? At the same time, are you being pulled toward voices that quietly or loudly push against the truth of the gospel? Pray that God will help you, like Timothy, to guard the truth of his Word and its message of salvation through Jesus Christ alone. Ask him to make you a steady and faithful witness to his Son.
