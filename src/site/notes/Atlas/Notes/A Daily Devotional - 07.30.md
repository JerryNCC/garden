是什么使神向祂的百姓发如此烈怒？在以赛亚书的这一段里，我们看得很清楚。以赛亚毫不含糊地指出，使神施行审判的种种罪恶。

首先，是骄傲的罪。这不是一般的骄傲，而是他们在遭遇患难时所表现出的狂妄态度。看看他们在灾祸临到时怎么说：“砖墙塌了，我们要凿石建造；桑树砍了，我们要换香柏树。”（赛9:10）他们在困境中并没有转向神，而是自恃能力，以为可以靠自己重建得更好，全然不承认他们对神的需要。

第二，是领袖的败坏。以赛亚说：“引导这百姓的使他们走错了路。”（赛9:16）当那些被呼召带领百姓的人不行在神的道中，他们就把众人一同引入罪中。这样的领导不是祝福，而是祸患。当治理者不按正义行事，百姓就陷在危险中。

第三，以赛亚指出百姓心中根深蒂固的自我中心。他们活在自己的私欲里，却永远得不到满足。“他们在右边切肉，仍是饥饿；在左边吞吃，仍不得饱。”（赛9:20）这种贪欲终将自我毁灭。以赛亚甚至形容他们吞吃自己的膀臂。这是一个可怕的画面，揭示了人若只为自己而活，会带来的后果。

第四，以赛亚转向那些滥用权势欺压弱小的人。这些富足有地位的人已经拥有许多，却仍不满足，反而压榨穷乏之人。他向那些“屈枉穷人在审判上，夺去我民中困苦人的权益”的人发出哀号（赛10:2）。贪婪与不义招致神的愤怒。

面对这些罪恶——骄傲、败坏的领袖、自私的心态与欺压弱者——以赛亚一次又一次重复这句严肃的话：“虽然如此，耶和华的怒气还未转消；他的手仍伸不缩。”（赛9:12, 17, 21；10:4）神是圣洁的，祂不容忽视罪恶。祂伸出的手仍未收回，审判仍在继续。

但福音的核心在于：本该向我们伸出的审判之手，神却转而伸向了祂自己的儿子。耶稣承担了我们本该受的刑罚。

> [!important]+ 反思与回应
所以，让我们安静地来到神面前，向祂承认我们的罪。祂喜悦祂的子民悔改归向祂。也再次为救主耶稣向神献上感恩，因为是祂为我们承受了本该属于我们的审判。

📖 **Passage to read**: ==Isaiah 09:08-10:04==

What has stirred God’s anger so deeply toward his people? In this section of Isaiah, we get a clear picture. Isaiah isn’t vague—he spells out the sins that have drawn God’s judgment.

First, we see pride. And not just any pride, but a proud response to hardship. Look at what the people say when trouble hits: “The bricks have fallen, but we will build with dressed stones” (9:10). They aren’t turning to God when things fall apart. Instead, they trust in themselves. They believe they can rebuild with something even better, without acknowledging their need for God.

Second, there’s the failure of leadership. Isaiah says, “those who guide this people have been leading them astray” (9:16). When leaders don’t walk in God’s ways, they pull others down with them. That kind of leadership brings harm, not help. The people are in real danger when those in charge don’t lead in righteousness.

Third, Isaiah speaks of a heart issue that runs deep in the people—a life lived for self. There’s no lasting peace or joy because their appetites are never satisfied. He writes, “They slice meat on the right, but are still hungry, and they devour on the left, but are not satisfied” (9:20). This restless hunger becomes self-destructive. Isaiah even pictures them devouring their own arms. It’s a haunting image of what happens when people live only for themselves.

Fourth, Isaiah turns his focus to the powerful who take advantage of the weak. These are the rich and influential who already have enough but still seek more at the expense of others. Isaiah cries out against those who “turn aside the needy from justice and … rob the poor of my people of their right” (10:2). Greed mixed with injustice brings God’s judgment.

For all these wrongs—pride, corrupt leadership, self-centeredness, and oppression—Isaiah repeats the same sobering line: “For all this his anger has not turned away, and his hand is stretched out still” (9:12, 17, 21; 10:4). God is holy. He does not ignore sin. His hand remains stretched out in judgment.

But here is the heart of the gospel: though we deserve that outstretched hand of judgment, God instead stretched it out toward his own Son. Jesus bore the judgment we should have faced.

> [!important]+ Reflect and Respond
So take a moment to confess your sin. God delights in his people returning to him. And thank him again for Jesus, the one who took our place.
