### <center>押沙龙，押沙龙！</center>

> [!info]- 🎙️Audio: [A Daily Devotional - 04.267 - CN]()

当我们阅读《撒母耳记下》第十八章时，我们看到的是一群真实的人，他们面对着真实的挣扎、诱惑和欲望。让我们仔细看看这段经文中的三个关键人物。

首先，想想大卫的军队。他们最显著的特点就是对大卫——神所拣选的君王——展现出的坚定忠诚。当大卫想要亲自率军迎战押沙龙的军队时，他们坚决阻止了他。他们的话语充分表达了他们的忠心：“你不可亲自出战……我们即便有一半的人阵亡，他们也不在意，但你比我们一万人更重要”（撒下18:3）。这些忠心的战士愿意为大卫付出一切，正因他们的献身与勇敢，他们最终取得了为大卫王国而战的伟大胜利。

接着，让我们看看押沙龙。他的故事向我们揭示了一个严峻的真理——悖逆神所膏立的君王，最终只会招致毁灭。无论押沙龙多么聪明或强大，神都不会允许他通过篡夺来夺取王位。最终，讽刺的是，他最引以为傲的长发竟成了他的死因。他被挂在树上，悬在半空，毫无还手之力，最终落入大卫军队的手中。对于这个曾凭借英俊外貌赢得民心、并将危机带到自己父亲王座前的人来说，这是一个悲剧性的结局。

在这一章的结尾，大卫并没有因胜利而欢庆。相反，他独自痛哭，为失去押沙龙而哀伤。罪的后果仍在他生命和家庭中延续，使他在悲痛与责任之间左右为难。虽然他最终走出哀悼，去见他的忠臣，但此刻，他展现出的形象是一个破碎的父亲——他为那个步入歧途、但从未真正悔改、也未曾敬畏神的儿子悲泣。

> [!important]+ 反思与回应
祈求神赐你力量，让你像大卫的战士一样，忠诚而谦卑地跟随耶稣。求祂坚固你的信心，让你始终站在基督一边，而非抵挡祂。跟随基督的道路不会总是容易，但它终将带来无比的荣耀和永恒的价值。

### <center>Absalom, Absalom!</center>

> [!question]+ Review
> 1. How did Absalom gain the support of the Israelites? What impact did this have on David’s rule?  
> 2. ⁠How does this passage reveal the consequences of sin? How do David and Absalom’s stories help us understand the importance of repentance?  
> 3. ⁠How does this devotional point us to Jesus Christ? How does Christ bring us true freedom?

📖 **Passage to read**: ==2 Samuel 18==

> [!info]- 🎙️Audio: [A Daily Devotional - 04.27 - EN]()  

When we read 2 Samuel 18, we see a story filled with real people facing real struggles, temptations, and desires. Let’s take a closer look at three key figures in this passage.  

First, think about David’s men. More than anything, they are known for their deep loyalty to David, God’s chosen king. When David tries to go into battle with them against Absalom’s army, they refuse. Their words show their devotion: “You shall not go out.… If half of us die, they will not care about us. But you are worth ten thousand of us” (18:3). They are willing to risk everything for David, and because of their dedication, they win a great victory for his kingdom.  

Now, consider Absalom. His story teaches us a hard truth—rebellion against God’s anointed king always ends in disaster. No matter how strong or clever he is, God will not allow him to take the throne by force. In the end, it’s ironic that the very thing he takes pride in—his long, flowing hair—leads to his downfall. He gets caught in a tree, left hanging, completely helpless before David’s men. It’s a tragic ending for the man who once charmed the people and brought chaos to his father’s kingdom.  

At the end of the chapter, David isn’t celebrating the victory. Instead, he is alone, weeping bitterly for his son. The consequences of sin are still playing out in his life and family, leaving him torn between grief and duty. Though he eventually sets aside his mourning and acknowledges his faithful men, we see him here as a broken father—mourning for a son who, like him, fell into sin but never truly repented or feared God.  

> [!important]+ Reflect and Respond
Ask God to help you follow Jesus with the same fierce and humble loyalty that David’s men had. Pray for strength to stand with Christ, never against him. It won’t always be easy, but in the end, following him is worth everything.
