### <center>真实的苦难，真实的安慰</center>

> [!info]- 🎙️Audio: [None]()


《哥林多后书》的核心主题之一，就是**受苦**。我们常常不知道该如何理解圣经中关于苦难的教导，也不太清楚该怎样把这些真理应用在自己的生活中。然而，对保罗来说，受苦不仅是他生命的一部分，更是他蒙召作基督使徒的重要标志。从这封信一开头，保罗就帮助我们看见，他的苦难意味着什么，以及上帝如何在苦难中成就祂的工作。

首先，保罗明白，他的受苦是与基督一同受苦。他写道：“我们既多受基督的苦楚，就靠基督多得安慰。”（1:5）——为福音而受苦，就是走在主耶稣所走过的路上。受苦让保罗（也让我们）更深地与基督联合。

但保罗的苦难并不仅仅是为了个人属灵的经历；他的苦难还有一个重要目的——**为了服事别人**。他说：“我们受患难，是为叫你们得安慰，得拯救。”（1:6）保罗愿意忍受痛苦、监禁和一切艰难，只为叫更多人认识基督，在信心中成长。他的忍耐与牺牲，正显明他对信徒深切的爱。

此外，保罗还一再强调：**为基督所受的苦，总有上帝所赐的安慰**。他称上帝为“慈悲的父，赐各样安慰的上帝”（1:3）。在苦难中，是上帝坚固并扶持祂的子民。保罗满有信心地见证说：“他曾救我们脱离那极大的死亡，以后还要救我们。”（1:10）

在书信后面，保罗进一步指出，这些苦难也证明了他事奉的真诚。因为凡忠心持守福音的人，必然会面对反对与试炼。然而，保罗深知：为主受苦是值得的——因为在苦难中，上帝的恩典显得更加光辉灿烂。哥林多教会本身，就是保罗忠心事奉所结出的果实。

**为耶稣受苦绝非无意义。**这是上帝的恩典，让我们能与救主一同经历祂的生命。即使是每天为抵挡罪恶所付出的挣扎，也是一种与基督同受苦的经历。当我们在基督里受苦，我们也必在荣耀中与祂同得荣耀。

让我们祷告，求上帝帮助我们在面对艰难时记得这一真理：当我们与基督一同受苦，我们也必从上帝那里得着真实的安慰与盼望。

### <center>Real Suffering and Real Comfort</center>

> [!question]+ Review
> 


📖 **Passage to read**: ==2 Corinthians 01.01-11==

> [!info]- 🎙️Audio: [None]()  


The theme of _suffering_ runs through the whole book of 2 Corinthians. We sometimes struggle to understand what the Bible teaches about suffering and how it connects to our own lives. But for Paul, suffering was a major part of his life and calling as an apostle of Jesus Christ. From the very beginning of this letter, Paul helps us see what his suffering means and how God works through it.

At the heart of it all, Paul’s suffering is about sharing in the sufferings of Christ. He writes, “As we share abundantly in Christ’s sufferings, so through Christ we share abundantly in comfort too” (1:5). To suffer for the gospel is to walk the same path as our Savior. It links Paul—and us—with Jesus himself.

But Paul’s suffering isn’t only about personal identification with Christ; it also has a purpose in ministry. He suffers _for the sake of others_. He tells the Corinthians, “If we are afflicted, it is for your comfort and salvation” (1:6). Paul endures pain, imprisonment, and hardship so that others might come to know Christ and grow in faith. His willingness to suffer shows how deeply he loves the people he serves.

There’s another truth Paul emphasizes here: every suffering we face for Christ is met with comfort from God. Paul calls God “the Father of mercies and God of all comfort” (1:3). Again and again, he affirms that God is the one who strengthens and delivers his people. Paul can say confidently that “He delivered us from such a deadly peril, and he will deliver us again” (1:10).

Later in this letter, Paul explains how his suffering has actually proven the sincerity of his ministry. Opposition and hardship come naturally to anyone who stands firm for the gospel. But Paul has learned that serving Christ, even through pain, is worth it—because through his trials, God’s grace shines all the brighter. The Corinthians themselves are living proof of the fruit of Paul’s faithful endurance.

Suffering for Jesus is never meaningless. It’s a gift—a way God lets us share in the life of our Savior. Even the small struggles of resisting sin each day are part of this sharing. When we suffer for Christ, we are being shaped to share in his glory as well.

> [!important]+ Reflect and Respond
Pray that when you face hardship, you will remember this truth: your suffering, joined with Christ, will always lead to God’s comfort and hope.
