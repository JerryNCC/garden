### <center>全心尊荣耶稣</center>

当 Susie 的母亲要她在出门与朋友玩之前先整理房间时，Susie 照做了——至少表面上是这样。她把所有东西都塞到床底下，剩下塞不下的就丢进衣橱里。房间看起来似乎“干净”了，但她母亲真正的用意却被忽略了。

这个小故事正好说明马可福音7:1–23的情形。法利赛人专注于神律法外在的细节，拘泥于各种仪式与规条，只想确保每一条规矩都被遵守。然而，他们在乎外表的同时，却失落了神真正所关心的核心。

耶稣的门徒没有遵守法利赛人饭前洗手的传统。法利赛人就质问耶稣：“你的门徒为什么不照长老的遗传洗手，却用不洁净的手吃饭呢？”（7:5）他们以为抓到了耶稣的把柄。但耶稣直接回应，引用以赛亚的话，指出那些“嘴唇尊敬神，心却远离祂”的人。随后，耶稣指责他们把自己的传统放在神的道之上，用人的规条取代了真实的顺服。

事后，耶稣向门徒解释这件事的真正意义：“从外面进去的，不能污秽人，惟有从里面出来的，乃能污秽人。”（7:15）罪并不在于手是否洁净或食物是否洗净，而是在于人心——我们的思想、爱慕与渴望。

> [!important]+ 反思与回应
神所要的不只是外在的宗教仪式，祂呼召我们将全心归给祂。真正的圣洁生活，是从信靠耶稣、离弃罪恶的心所流露出来的果子。求神赐给我们一颗真爱祂的心，使我们的言语与行为都能显明对救主、主宰耶稣的真诚敬拜。

📖 **Passage to read**: ==Mark 07.01-23==

> [!info]- 🎙️Audio: [None]()  


When Susie’s mom told her to clean her room before going out with friends, Susie did it—at least on the surface. She shoved everything under her bed, and whatever didn’t fit went into the closet. Technically, the room looked “clean,” but the real purpose of her mom’s request was missed.

That little story helps us see what is happening in Mark 7:1–23. The Pharisees were focused on the outward details of God’s law, the small rituals and practices. They wanted to make sure every rule was followed. But in their focus on the outside, they lost sight of what God really cares about.

Jesus’s disciples didn’t follow the Pharisees’ special hand-washing traditions before eating. The Pharisees challenged Jesus: “Why do your disciples not walk according to the tradition of the elders, but eat with defiled hands?” (7:5). They thought they had caught Him in a failure. But Jesus answered sharply. He quoted Isaiah, who spoke of people who honor God with their lips while their hearts are far away. Then He accused them of putting their own traditions above the word of God. Their rituals had replaced true obedience.

Later, Jesus explained to His disciples what this means. “There is nothing outside a person that by going into him can defile him, but the things that come out of a person are what defile him” (7:15). Sin is not about dirty hands or unwashed food. It is about the heart—what we think, love, and desire.

> [!important]+ Reflect and Respond
God wants more than outward religion. He calls us to give Him our whole hearts. Holy living flows from hearts that trust Jesus and turn from sin. Pray that God will give you a heart that truly loves Him, so that your words and actions show real devotion to Jesus, our Savior and Lord.
