### <center>一场庄严的仪式</center>

> [!info]- 🎙️Audio: [A Daily Devotional - 02.13 - CN]()

你是否曾在电视上观看过总统就职典礼？那是一个极具影响力的事件，充满了形式、传统与庄重，彰显了总统职务的重要性。宣誓就职的那一刻，作为新总统的人必定感受到这份责任的重大，心中充满了使命感。

《利未记》第八章讲述的也是一场类似的庄严仪式，但这次并非为总统，而是为神的祭司——那些被神拣选来为百姓服务的人。亚伦和他的家人被神选为祭司，他们的职责是作为人类与神之间的中保，通过献祭来恢复并维持百姓与神的关系。从某种程度上说，以色列百姓是否能正确地敬拜神，取决于祭司的忠诚、顺服与精心的事奉。

然而，这段经文中有一个引人注目的地方：即使祭司肩负着如此重要的角色，他们在一件事上与神的百姓并无二致——他们同样需要通过血的洁净，才能够忠实地事奉神。事实上，这整章经文都是关于这一洁净过程的！首先，亚伦和他的儿子们被水洁净。接着，他们被膏上圣油。然后，一头公牛为他们献祭。接下来，一只公羊也为他们献祭。最后，又有一只公羊被宰杀——这只公羊是奉献的祭物。祭司们随后被油和血洒在身上。这是一个长时间、细致入微的奉献过程，是将他们分别为圣、归神为用的过程。

是的，这些人将代表百姓事奉神。是的，他们将充当神与人之间的中保。然而，最重要的是，这些祭司也是普通的人成员，他们同样需要通过祭物的洁净与血的涂抹，才能被神接纳，成为圣洁的器皿。因为他们也是罪人，与其他人一样。

> [!important]+ 反思与回应
从这一段经文中，我们学到一个重要的教训：罪恶的人需要先被神洁净，才能事奉祂。在你事奉神之前，首先要确保你已经被神洁净——那洁净是通过耶稣在十字架上为你所成就的赦免。今天，花些时间感谢神，因耶稣的死洁净了你脱离罪恶，并请求祂帮助你以回应祂伟大的恩典，忠心事奉祂。

### <center>A Weighty Ceremony</center>

> [!question]+ Review
> 1.  In Leviticus 4, why does God instruct the high priest to sprinkle blood in front of the veil of the sanctuary? What does this symbolize?
> 2.⁠ ⁠Why is sin’s nature and its consequences so severe? Why is sin not only an offense against people but also a desecration against God?
> 3.⁠ ⁠Based on this passage, how should we view what Jesus accomplished for our sins? How can we truly establish a relationship with this holy God?

📖 **Passage to read**: ==Leviticus 08==

> [!info]- 🎙️Audio: [A Daily Devotional - 02.13 - EN]()  

Have you ever watched a presidential inauguration on television? It’s a powerful event. Full of formality, tradition, and weight, the ceremony reflects the importance of the office. The person taking the oath as president likely feels the great responsibility that comes with the role during this ceremony.

Leviticus 8 is about a similar weighty ceremony, but this time, it’s not for a president—it’s for the priests of God, who are chosen to serve the people. Aaron and his family are selected by God to be these priests. Their job is to serve as intermediaries between the people and God, making sacrifices to restore and maintain the people’s relationship with their holy Creator. In many ways, Israel’s proper worship of God depended on the faithfulness, obedience, and care of these priests.

But there’s something striking in this passage: even though priests have such an important role, they are not different from the rest of the people in one crucial way—they too need to be cleansed by blood before they can serve God. In fact, this whole chapter is about that cleansing process! First, Aaron and his sons are washed with water. Then they are anointed with oil. After that, a bull is sacrificed for them. Then, a ram is sacrificed. Finally, another ram, called the ordination ram, is sacrificed. The priests are then sprinkled with oil and blood from the sacrifices. It’s a long and detailed process of consecration, a process of setting them apart as holy for God’s service. 

Yes, these men will serve God on behalf of the people. Yes, they will act as mediators between God and humans. But, importantly, these human priests also need the purifying and cleansing blood of sacrifice. They are sinful men, just like everyone else.

> [!important]+ Reflect and Respond
One major lesson from this passage is that sinful humans need to be washed by God before they can serve Him. Before you offer your service to God, make sure you’ve been cleansed by Him—through the forgiveness that comes from Jesus’s death on the cross. Take time today to thank God for cleansing you from your sin through Jesus and ask Him to help you serve Him in response to His amazing gift.
