### <center>一个意外的领袖与一个愚蠢的誓言</center>

> [!info]- 🎙️Audio: [A Daily Devotional - 03.26 - CN]()


当我们在《士师记》11章首次遇见基弗他时，他可能会让我们想起罗宾汉。他是一个被家人抛弃的外人，因为他的母亲是妓女。然而，基弗他成长为一位强大的战士，吸引了其他同样被社会排斥的人——“无赖”（11:3）——他们聚集在他周围，像罗宾汉的强盗队伍一样。在读完基甸的故事后，我们可能认为再也找不到比基弗他更不可能成为以色列英雄的人了，但他就在这里——基弗他！

以色列再次远离神，陷入了偶像崇拜之中。作为惩罚，神允许强大的敌人——亚扪人，来攻打以色列。亚扪人入侵的威胁笼罩在《士师记》11章开始时，以色列人迫切需要一位领袖来拯救他们。于是，他们转向了那个他们不尊敬、但又极需的领袖——被排斥的基弗他。基弗他答应带领他们出征，但前提是他们发誓，如果他战胜了亚扪人，他们就立他为领袖。于是，神通过这个外人使用他来拯救以色列脱离敌人的手。

然而，尽管这个故事最终带来了巨大的胜利，却以悲剧的方式收尾。战斗前，基弗他做了一个愚蠢的誓言。他发誓，如果神赐给他胜利，他将献祭家中第一个出来迎接他的人。当战斗结束后，基弗他回到家时，他的女儿跑出来迎接他。为了履行誓言，基弗他悲痛欲绝地将自己的女儿献为祭物。这样，这位以色列的“拯救者”竟然和周围那些为取悦神明而进行儿童祭祀的异教国家无异。神虽然使用了基弗他来拯救以色列，但显然基弗他并未真正认识或爱神。他作为以色列士师的短暂任期也因内乱和分裂而告终。

> [!important]+ 反思与回应
这个故事让我们看到了，神可以使用任何人和任何事来完成祂的目的。在这个故事中，神用一个外人带来了胜利。但它也给我们提出了警示。神也能使用我们，但关键是我们要真正认识祂、爱祂。我为你祷告，愿你被神使用，不仅为祂的百姓服务，还要被祂作为祂的儿女所爱和接纳。今天，我祈祷你能够全心跟随耶稣，让祂使用你为祂的百姓，同时你也能真正属于祂的家。

### <center>A Surprising Leader and a Foolish Vow</center>

> [!question]+ Review
> 1. ⁠Why didn’t Gideon become the king the Israelites needed, despite their request? What lessons can we learn from his decisions and actions?
> 2. After Gideon’s death, the Israelites quickly turned to idol worship. What warnings does this pattern offer to us today? How can we avoid falling into similar traps in our lives?
> 3. What does Gideon’s story teach us about human expectations of leaders? How should we discern true leadership and follow it under God’s guidance?

📖 **Passage to read**: ==Judges 11==

> [!info]- 🎙️Audio: [A Daily Devotional - 03.26 - EN]()  

When we first meet Jephthah in Judges 11, he might remind us of someone like Robin Hood. He was an outcast, cast out from his family because his mother was a prostitute. But Jephthah rose to become a mighty warrior, gathering around him other outcasts—“worthless fellows” (11:3)—who joined him, much like Robin Hood’s group of rebels. After reading about Gideon, we may have thought there couldn't be a more unlikely hero for God's people. But here is Jephthah!

Once again, Israel has turned away from God and has fallen into idolatry. As a result, God allows the Ammonites, a cruel enemy, to come against Israel. The threat of the Ammonite invasion looms large as Judges 11 begins, and Israel is desperate for a leader who can save them. So, they turn to Jephthah, a man they don’t respect but are in desperate need of. Jephthah agrees to lead them in battle after they promise to make him their leader if he defeats the Ammonites. In an incredible turn of events, God uses this outcast to deliver Israel from their enemies.

Yet, even with such a great victory, the story ends in a tragic way. Before the battle, Jephthah makes a rash vow. He promises to sacrifice whatever comes out of his house first if God grants him victory. After the battle, as Jephthah returns home, his daughter comes running to greet him. To keep his vow, Jephthah tragically sacrifices his own daughter. In this way, the “savior” of Israel ends up no better than the surrounding pagan nations, who practiced child sacrifice to appease their gods. While God used Jephthah to deliver his people, it is clear that Jephthah did not truly know or love God. His brief time as a judge of Israel ends in civil war and division.

> [!important]+ Reflect and Respond
This story shows us that God can use anyone—and anything—to accomplish his purposes. In this case, God used an outcast to bring victory to his people. But it also serves as a warning. God can use us too, but it is important that we truly know and love him. My prayer for you is that you will be used by God, not only to serve his people but also to be loved and accepted as God’s child. Today, I pray that you would follow Jesus fully, allowing him to use you for his people, and that you would truly belong to his family.
