### <center>该犹与丢特腓</center>

> [!info]- 🎙️Audio: [None]()

很有可能，《约翰一书》《约翰二书》和《约翰三书》都是使徒约翰在同一时期写成的，并一同装在一个信件包裹中送出。如果这是真的，那么这三封信中，其中一封就是我们眼前的这封——一封更为私人、写给一位名叫该犹的弟兄的书信。这是一封很短的书信，也许你以前从未读过，或几乎没有仔细思想过！那么，这封多年前写给该犹的小小书信，对我们这些二十一世纪跟随耶稣基督的人来说，又有什么话要说呢？

这封信首先提醒我们：当我们支持并鼓励神的子民时，神是喜悦的。这正是使徒约翰在信一开始所称赞该犹的地方。虽然除了这封信之外，我们对该犹一无所知，但约翰在第 5–8 节清楚表明，这个人帮助弟兄，爱主的地方教会，并支持那些传讲、教导福音的人。我们或许要等到将来在天上遇见该犹，才能确切知道他是如何帮助、支持和鼓励这些福音工人的；但因着约翰的见证，我们知道他确实这样做了。神也喜悦这位弟兄——他在古代世界中，藉着鼓励神的子民，参与了使人认识耶稣的工作。

然而，这封信中还出现了另一位人物——一个名叫丢特腓的人。约翰对这个人并不满意。为什么呢？因为他“好为首”，不承认耶稣基督使徒的权柄和他们的教训（第 9 节）。显然，这个人曾用恶意而不真实的话毁谤约翰，甚至可能也毁谤其他使徒；并且他的行为正好与该犹相反：“他不接待弟兄，那想要接待的，他也禁止，并且把他们赶出教会”（第 10 节）。丢特腓抵挡使徒所传的福音，不支持，也不鼓励神的子民。神不喜悦他，约翰也同样不喜悦！约翰告诉该犹，等他来的时候，会亲自处理这件事。

> [!important]+ 反思与回应 
虽然《约翰三书》是一封很短的书信，但它的信息却十分清楚：**在任何时代，神的子民都应当支持福音事工，并支持那些参与其中的人。**那么，你呢？你是如何对待神的子民的？你是否为那些在你所在的国家，甚至在世界各地传扬耶稣福音的人祷告，并在实际行动上支持他们？求神使你像该犹一样——成为一个爱神的子民、支持神工作的信徒。

### <center>Gaius and Diotrephes</center>

📖 **Passage to read**: ==3 John==

> [!info]- 🎙️Audio: [None]()  

There is a good chance that 1, 2, and 3 John were all written by the apostle at one time and carried together in a packet to be delivered. If this is true, then one of the three letters in this bundle was this letter—a more personal letter, to a man named Gaius. It’s a short letter, which maybe you’ve never read before or given much thought to at all! What does this little letter, written to Gaius long ago, have to say to us today as twenty-first-century followers of Jesus Christ?

This letter reminds us, first, that God is pleased when we support and encourage his people. That’s what the apostle John commends Gaius for as this letter begins. While we know nothing about Gaius outside of what is in this letter, John makes it clear in verses 5–8 that this man helps the brothers, loves the local church of Jesus, and supports the work of people who are preaching and teaching the gospel. We probably won’t know until we meet Gaius in heaven exactly _how_ he helped, supported, and encouraged these gospel workers, but because of John, we know that he did. And God is pleased with this man who encouraged his people as they sought to make Jesus known in the ancient world.

But another character shows up in this letter—a fellow named Diotrephes. John is not too happy with this man. Why? Because he “likes to put himself first” and does not recognize the authority of the apostles of Jesus Christ and their teaching (v. 9). This man has evidently spoken evil and untrue words about John, and possibly other apostles, and does the exact opposite of Gaius: “He refuses to welcome the brothers, and also stops those who want to and puts them out of the church” (v. 10). Diotrephes opposes the gospel of the apostles and fails to support and encourage God’s people. God is not pleased with him, and neither is John! He tells Gaius that he will deal with this man when he comes.

> [!important]+ Reflect and Respond
_While 3 John is a short letter, its message is clear: God’s people, in every age, support gospel ministry and those who engage in it. How about you? How do you treat God’s people? Do you pray for—and support—people who seek to share the good news about Jesus in your country and around the world? Ask God to make you like Gaius—a man who loved God’s people and supported God’s work._
