《灰姑娘》的故事、威尔·史密斯主演的电影《当幸福来敲门》以及约翰尼·卡什的生平——这些都是我们熟知的从贫困到富有的故事。在《创世记》第41章中，我们看到一个更加难以置信的从贫困到富有的故事。这是一个神完全改变约瑟生命的故事，只有神的主权之手才能如此精妙地安排。

在《创世记》41章的开头，约瑟仍然被遗忘在监狱里，一个毫不起眼的外乡人。然而，到了这一章的结尾，他已经坐在法老旁边，掌握着巨大的权力和影响力。法老因一个梦境而烦恼，终于那位忘记的酒政想起了约瑟——那个两年前为他解梦的希伯来人。法老召来约瑟，约瑟在神的帮助下解读了法老的梦，预示着埃及将有七年的丰收，然后是七年的饥荒。法老被约瑟的智慧所打动，并意识到约瑟的恩赐是来自神，因此他不仅将约瑟从监狱中释放，还将他任命为埃及的第二号人物。年仅三十岁的约瑟，经历了多年困苦和看似无尽的厄运，如今却成为了掌权的君主。

在这里，我们可以清楚地看到神的手在运作。再看最后一节：“全地的人都来埃及向约瑟买粮，因为天下的饥荒甚大。”（41:57）早在《创世记》中，神曾向亚伯拉罕应许，地上的万国将因他得福。通过约瑟，神以一种小小的方式开始实现这个应许，借着约瑟为全地提供食物。这个应许的更大实现将会在耶稣降临时完全显现，但我们已经能在此看到它的开端。并且记住，“全地的人”包括谁呢？雅各和他的全家！神将约瑟安置在这个权力的位置，使得在饥荒来临时，他能够为神的子民提供食物。以此方式，神通过对约瑟的信实，向所有的子民展现了祂的信实。

> [!important]+ 反思与回应
信靠神往往不容易，尤其是当我们无法看清神完美计划中的所有细节时。即使到这个故事的阶段，约瑟仍然不能完全理解他的新职位对他家族的救赎意味着什么。但神知道。我们可以求神赐给我们信心，帮助我们信靠祂，顺服祂，跟随祂的儿子耶稣，即使我们并不完全了解祂计划中的每一个细节。

> 1. In Genesis 40, how is God's sovereignty demonstrated through Joseph's time in prison?

> 3. Joseph trusted God even in difficult circumstances. What does this teach us about facing challenges today?

📖 **Passage to read**: ==Genesis 41==

> [!info]- 🎙️Audio: [A Daily Devotional - 01.29 - EN]()

The story of Cinderella, the movie The Pursuit of Happyness starring Will Smith, and the life of Johnny Cash—all of these are popular rags-to-riches stories. In Genesis 41, we find one that’s even more unbelievable. It’s the story of how God completely changes Joseph’s life in a way that only His sovereign hand could orchestrate.

At the start of Genesis 41, Joseph is still in prison, forgotten by everyone, and stuck in a foreign land. By the end of the chapter, he is sitting beside Pharaoh, holding great power and influence. Pharaoh is troubled by a dream, and at last, the cupbearer remembers Joseph, the Hebrew man who had correctly interpreted his dream two years before. Pharaoh calls Joseph from prison, and Joseph, with God’s help, interprets Pharaoh’s dream. He predicts seven years of abundance followed by seven years of famine. Pharaoh, impressed by Joseph’s wisdom and realizing that Joseph’s gift is from God, not only frees him from prison but also makes him second-in-command of Egypt. At just 30 years old, after years of hardship and what seemed like endless bad luck, Joseph is now a ruler of great power.

What we see here is unmistakably the hand of God at work. Look at the last verse again: “All the earth came to Egypt to Joseph to buy grain, because the famine was severe over all the earth” (41:57). Earlier in Genesis, God promised Abraham that all nations would be blessed through him. In a small way, God begins to fulfill this promise to Abraham through Joseph, by using him to provide food for the entire world. There will be a much greater fulfillment of this promise when Jesus comes later, but we can already see it beginning to unfold here. And remember who is included in “all the earth”: Jacob and his entire family. God positioned Joseph in this place of power so that, when famine came, Joseph would be able to provide for God’s people. In this way, God is faithful to all His people through His faithfulness to Joseph.

Trusting God can be difficult, especially when we don’t know all the details of His plan. Even now, Joseph doesn’t fully understand what his new position will mean for his family back home. But God does. We can ask God to give us the faith to trust Him, obey Him, and follow Jesus, even when we don’t see the full picture of His plan.
