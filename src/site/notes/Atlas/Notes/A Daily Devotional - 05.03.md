### <center>大卫的临终遗言</center>

> [!info]- 🎙️Audio: [A Daily Devotional - 05.03 - CN]()

死亡让人变得庄重。临终之际，我们的话语更慎重，我们的思想更深远。因此，当以色列王大卫卧病在床、命在旦夕时，我们可以想见，他向儿子所罗门所说的每一句话，都是斟酌再三、意义非凡。

大卫开口所谈的，是他最看重的事：紧紧跟随神，遵行祂的话语。对大卫而言，这正是真正的刚强与男子气概的体现。他对所罗门说：“你当刚强，作大丈夫，遵守耶和华你神所吩咐的，行祂的道，守祂的律例。”（列王纪上2:2–3）大卫并不是随口劝勉，而是郑重地劝诫儿子，要一生行在神的旨意中。他还提醒所罗门，神曾应许过他：若他谨守神的道，他的国位必得坚立。这才是一位君王应有的样式；这，才是一个真正男人该有的生命。

然而，话题很快转向了另一个出人意料的方向。大卫提到两位具体的人，吩咐所罗门要果断处理。同时，他也叮嘱儿子善待那些忠心的朋友。乍听之下，这些命令似乎带着私人恩怨，甚至有些报复的意味。但若我们细看，就会发现，大卫并非为自己伸冤，而是为了国家的安稳。

譬如约押——他杀害了两位以色列的军队统帅，使大卫的王朝背负血债，蒙受羞辱。大卫吩咐所罗门予以惩处，为的是不让这桩罪行继续成为新王统治下的阴影。至于示每，那位曾在大卫逃难时辱骂他的便雅悯人，大卫也知他若继续存留，可能会再度挑起纷争。因此，这些吩咐，并非出于私仇，而是出于对国家长治久安的深谋远虑。

所罗门如实遵行了父亲的遗言。章节的结尾，描绘出一个强而有力的崭新开端：所罗门登基，仇敌被除，国土得以统一，王朝重新稳固。

> [!important]+ 反思与回应
大卫一生活在神的话语之下。如今走到人生的终点，他最大的心愿，就是盼望儿子也能如此而行。那么你呢？你是否也让神的话语作你生命每一步的引导？今天，不妨静下心来祷告，求神帮助你，让你深深爱耶稣，凡事遵行祂的话语。这样的生命，才值得传承，才不虚此生。

### <center>David’s Deathbed Speech</center>

> [!question]+ Review
> 1. Why did Adonijah try to make himself king? What does his action reveal about his attitude toward God's will?
> 2. How did Bathsheba and Nathan show their trust in and obedience to God's promise? What can we learn from their actions for our own faith journey today?
> 3. How did Solomon deal with Adonijah's rebellion? How does this story help us understand both the mercy and justice of Jesus?

📖 **Passage to read**: ==1 Kings 02:01-12==

> [!info]- 🎙️Audio: [A Daily Devotional - 05.03 - EN]()  

Death has a way of making us serious. We think more carefully. We speak with more weight. So when David, Israel’s king, was on his deathbed, we can be sure he chose his last words with care—especially when speaking to his son, Solomon.

David starts with what matters most: staying close to God by obeying His word. This, to David, is what it means to be strong and to be a man. He tells Solomon, “Be strong, and show yourself a man, and keep the charge of the LORD your God, walking in his ways and keeping his statutes” (2:2–3). David isn’t giving vague advice—he’s urging his son to live by God’s commands. He even reminds him of God’s promise: if Solomon follows God, his rule will be established. This is how a king should live. This is how a man should live.

But then the conversation takes a surprising turn. David tells Solomon to deal with two specific men—and to deal with them firmly. He also asks Solomon to show kindness to faithful friends. At first glance, this might sound personal or even vengeful. But look closer: David isn’t asking for payback. He’s thinking of the kingdom.

Take Joab, for example. Joab had murdered two respected military leaders, which brought bloodguilt and shame to David’s rule. David tells Solomon to act, so this wrong won’t hang over the new king’s reign. Then there’s Shimei, the man who cursed David during a low point in his life. David knows that if left unchecked, Shimei could stir up trouble again. David’s instructions aren’t about settling old scores—they’re about keeping the kingdom safe and steady under Solomon’s leadership.

And Solomon does just that. The chapter ends with a strong new beginning: Solomon takes the throne, the enemies are dealt with, and the kingdom stands united.

> [!important]+ Reflect and Respond
David had lived his life under God’s word. As he faced death, his greatest desire was for his son to live the same way. What about you? Are you living under God’s word—not just in theory, but in every part of your life? Take time today to pray. Ask God to make His word the center of your life, and to help you love Jesus deeply. That’s the kind of life that leaves behind a legacy worth passing on.
