### <center>心的改变</center>

> [!info]- 🎙️Audio: [A Daily Devotional - 03.05 - CN]()

想象一下，一个名叫杰克的高中生。杰克有个问题——超速问题。他喜欢开车快，这总是让他得到很多超速罚单。有关超速的法律非常明确，杰克知道这些规定。每条街上都挂着限速标志，显而易见！但问题不在于法律或标志，而在于他内心深处。

在《出埃及记》、《利未记》、《民数记》和《申命记》这几本书中，或许看起来神只是要求祂的百姓遵守规则、改变行为。然而，当我们仔细阅读《申命记》10:12-22时，我们看到一个更重要的真理。神的目标从来不是单纯通过遵守规则来改变人的行为。祂一直追求的是心灵的转变。神希望祂的百姓学会爱祂，并且因为这份爱，从内心出发，被改变来遵行祂的话语。

摩西继续他的讲道，提醒百姓要敬畏神、爱神、侍奉神、遵守神的命令，这一切是因为神的伟大和祂所做的拯救与祝福。然后摩西说道：“所以你们要把你们心里的“污秽”割除，不可再硬着心”（10:16）。这句话可能一开始听起来有些奇怪。割礼是神与祂的百姓立约的外在标志，所有出生的男婴都要在第八天接受割礼。然而，摩西在这里将这一外在的行为作为比喻，指向百姓内心需要发生的变化。他们的心要“被割礼”，必须经历一种内心的转变，就像割礼是一个标志，标示他们是为神所分别出来的。换句话说，真正的顺服神并非从改变行为开始，而是从改变内心开始。神不仅仅是在寻找遵守规则的人，祂更希望看到那些因爱祂并经历了祂的恩典，愿意遵行祂话语的人。

> [!important]+ 反思与回应
行为的改变（遵守规则）是心灵转变的结果。你的心灵是否经历了转变？你是否越来越渴望追求神所喜悦的，越来越痛恨罪恶，渴望遵循神的话语？今天，花些时间与神交谈，求祂继续改变你的心，使你每天的行为更加荣耀祂。

### <center>A Change of Heart</center>

> [!question]+ Review
> 1. ⁠Why does Moses remind the people in Deuteronomy 9 not to be proud of their own righteousness? What does this teach us about the only reason we enter the promised land by God's grace?
> 2. ⁠Moses reminds the people that they provoked God to anger and almost faced destruction, what warning does this give us? How should we reflect on our own attitudes and actions?
> 3. ⁠How can we avoid becoming prideful and thinking we deserve God's grace in our lives today? What steps can you take to continually remind yourself of God’s grace and love?

📖 **Passage to read**: ==Deuteronomy 10:12-22==

> [!info]- 🎙️Audio: [A Daily Devotional - 03.05 - EN]()  

Imagine a high school student named Jake. Jake has a problem—a speeding problem. He loves to drive fast, and it always ends with him getting speeding tickets. The laws against speeding are clear, and Jake knows about them. Speed limit signs are posted everywhere for all to see! But the problem isn’t the laws or the signs; it’s something deeper—it’s inside him.

In the books of Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, and Deuteronomy, it might seem like God is simply telling His people to follow the rules and change their behavior. But when we look closely at Deuteronomy 10:12–22, we see something much more important. God’s goal has never been just behavior modification through rule-keeping. He has always been after something deeper: heart transformation. God wants His people to learn to love Him and, from that love, be changed from the inside out to obey His word.

Moses continues his message by reminding the people to fear God, love Him, serve Him, and obey His commands—because of who God is and what He has done in saving and blessing them. Then Moses says, “Circumcise therefore the foreskin of your heart, and be no longer stubborn” (10:16). This verse might seem a bit strange at first. Circumcision was the physical sign of God’s covenant with His people, done on every male child born into the community. But here, Moses takes that physical act and uses it as a metaphor for what must happen to the hearts of God’s people. They need hearts that are “circumcised.” There must be an inward change in them, just as circumcision was an outward sign of being set apart for God. In other words, true obedience to God doesn’t start with behavior change; it starts with heart change. God isn’t just looking for people who follow rules—He’s looking for people who follow His word because they love Him and have been changed by His grace. 

> [!important]+ Reflect and Respond
Behavior change (keeping the rules) is the result of heart transformation. Has your heart been transformed? Do you find yourself more and more desiring what God wants, hating sin more, and longing to obey His word? Take some time today to talk to God about this. Ask Him to keep transforming your heart, so that your actions will honor Him more and more each day.
