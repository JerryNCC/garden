### <center>爱情的力量</center>

> [!info]- 🎙️Audio: [A Daily Devotional - 07.24 - CN]()


火，在适当的使用下是有益的。它可以煮食，也能带来温暖。但火若失控蔓延，便会造成极大破坏，甚至威胁生命。原本美好的事物，若脱离了正确的界限，也能变成危险之源。

性亦是如此。放在婚姻中，它是上帝所赐的美好礼物。所罗门在《雅歌》中正是如此描绘与欢庆婚姻中的爱情。但若将性撕裂出婚姻的范围，它便可能带来伤害、痛苦与毁灭。因此，即便这位女子正在婚姻中享受爱的甘甜，她仍郑重地向年轻女子发出劝诫：“耶路撒冷的众女子啊，我嘱咐你们，不要激动爱情，等它自发。”（雅歌 8:4）多么奇妙！她在爱中，却呼喊：“你们要等候！”因为她深知爱情的力量。她接着说：“因为爱情如死之坚强……所发的电光是火焰的电光，是耶和华的烈焰。”（8:6）如此强烈的礼物，不可轻率对待！

临近书卷结尾时，其他人谈到他们年幼的妹妹，她尚未适合出嫁。“墙”与“门”的比喻正是描述贞洁——在婚前守住自己的身体。这再次重申整卷书的信息：性与爱情都是上帝所赐的美善，但应在婚姻中才能完全享受。所以，要等候。

圣经从不避讳谈论性，它欢庆男女之间的爱情，并非羞耻之事。但它也清楚地教导：要等候。等候那适当的时机，等候那敬虔的伴侣。如此，当你进入婚姻时，便能以上帝原设的方式，尽情地享受爱情、性与亲密，在其中荣耀祂。

> [!important]+ 反思与回应
因此，今天就祷告求上帝帮助你持守祂对婚姻的心意。如何做到呢？祂的圣灵能帮助你在思想、言语与行为上追求圣洁。借着祂的帮助，你可以为圣洁而活。人们也将从你的生命中看见你属主的印记，并因你而认识耶稣里真正的爱、盼望与救恩。

### <center>The Power of Love</center>

> [!question]+ Review
> 1. ⁠How does the man express his love for his wife in Song of Solomon 7? What kind of view on marriage does this reflect?
> 2. ⁠What does the verse “I am my beloved’s, and his desire is for me” (Song of Solomon 7:10) reveal about the woman’s heart and her sense of security in the relationship?
> 3. How does this passage help us understand God’s design and boundaries for sex and marriage?

📖 **Passage to read**: ==Songs of Solomon 08==

> [!info]- 🎙️Audio: [A Daily Devotional - 07.24 - EN]()  

Fire is helpful when it’s used in the right way. It can cook our food and keep us warm. But fire can also be dangerous—if it spreads out of control, it can destroy homes, forests, and lives. Something that is good in one setting can become harmful in another.

Sex is like that. In marriage, it’s a good gift from God. That’s what Solomon shows us in the Song of Solomon. He celebrates the love between a husband and wife. But outside of that setting, sex can hurt people deeply. That’s why, even as the woman in the Song enjoys love with her husband, she calls out a warning to others: “I adjure you, O daughters of Jerusalem, that you not stir up or awaken love until it pleases” (8:4). She wants younger women to wait. She knows how strong love is. Later, she says, “Love is strong as death.… Its flashes are flashes of fire, the very flame of the Lord” (8:6). Love is not something to play with. It is powerful and must be handled with care.

Near the end of the book, others speak about their younger sister. She isn’t married yet, and the language they use—talking about her being a “wall” or a “door”—is about protecting her purity. The point is clear: sex and love are good, but they belong in marriage. So wait.

The Bible is not embarrassed to talk about sex. It celebrates the love between a man and a woman. But it also says: wait. Wait until the time is right. Wait for the right person. When that time comes, you can enjoy love fully, in a way that honors God and brings joy.

> [!important]+ Reflect and Respond
So ask God to help you follow his way, even now. Ask him to give you strength to stay pure—in your thoughts, your words, and your actions. Ask his Spirit to help you live in a way that points to Jesus. When you do, others will see that you belong to him, and you’ll be able to show them where true love and hope are found.
