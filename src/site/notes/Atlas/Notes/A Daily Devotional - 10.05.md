门徒们心里忧愁。为什么？因为耶稣一再提到自己将要离开。他们无法想象没有耶稣的日子——若祂真的走了，他们该怎么办？约翰福音第十四章，就是耶稣回应他们忧虑的答案。祂在这里的话语，满有安慰。那么，祂如何安慰他们呢？

首先，祂把他们的眼目转向一个地方。祂说祂要去为他们预备。祂说：“在我父的家里，有许多住处；若是没有，我就早已告诉你们了。我去原是为你们预备地方去。”（14:2）祂的离去，并不是结束，而是新的开始——是为神的子民预备一个永恒的家园。祂的应许就是：凡属祂、爱祂的人，将来必永远与神同在。这就是天堂。

然而，门徒们依然不明白。他们以为耶稣所说的地方是在地上。多马便说：“主啊，我们不知道你往哪里去，怎么知道那条路呢？”（14:5）耶稣的回答，是圣经中最清楚的救恩宣告之一：“我就是道路、真理、生命；若不借着我，没有人能到父那里去。”（14:6）罪人如何能来到父面前？不是靠律法，不是靠努力，不是另有他路——唯独借着耶稣基督。祂自己就是通往父的唯一道路。

耶稣既指向那永恒的地方，也表明自己是进入那里的唯一道路；同时，祂更给门徒一个在此期间的应许：“我要求父，祂就另外赐给你们一位保惠师，叫祂永远与你们同在，就是真理的圣灵。”（14:16–17）门徒已经认识了耶稣，这位正确的人，但他们还需要等候，直到在父的家里与祂相聚。在等待的日子里，神要赐下圣灵，住在他们里面，引导他们、扶持他们、带领他们紧紧跟随耶稣。

那么，信徒在患难忧愁中，最大的安慰是什么？是一个地方的盼望——有一天，他们将与神同住，安息在祂永恒的家里。是一个人的盼望——耶稣，祂是唯一的救主，也是唯一通向父的道路。更是一个应许的盼望——圣灵如今与我们同在，天天带领我们一步一步走在信心的路上。

所以，当你在困境中仰望时，请向天父祷告，求祂使你紧紧抓住这永恒的盼望，直到那日你亲自在祂面前与祂同住。

### <center>The Way, the Truth, and the Life</center>

> [!question]+ Review
> 1. How does John describe Jesus’s love for his disciples at the beginning? In what way is this “love to the end” shown through the act of washing feet?
> 2. Why was Peter at first unwilling to let Jesus wash his feet? How did Jesus respond, and what does this mean for us?
> 3. How does the act of foot washing point to the salvation of the cross? Why must we first be served by Jesus before we can serve others?

📖 **Passage to read**: ==John 14==

> [!info]- 🎙️Audio: [None]()  

The disciples are upset. Why? Because Jesus keeps talking about leaving. They can’t stand the thought of being without him. If he really goes away, what will happen to them? John 14 is Jesus’s answer. His words here are meant to comfort. So how does he do that?

First, he points them to a place. He tells them that he is going to prepare it for them. “In my Father’s house are many rooms,” he says. “If it were not so, would I have told you that I go to prepare a place for you?” (14:2). His leaving is not the end—it is the start of preparing a home for his people. His promise is that those who love and follow him will live forever in God’s presence. That is heaven.

But the disciples still don’t get it. They think Jesus is talking about some earthly place. Thomas speaks up: “Lord, we do not know where you are going. How can we know the way?” (14:5). Jesus’s reply is one of the clearest answers to the question of salvation: “I am the way, and the truth, and the life. No one comes to the Father except through me” (14:6). How can sinners find their way to God? Not by rules, not by effort, not by another path—only through Jesus himself. He is the one way to the Father.

So Jesus speaks of a place, and he points to himself as the only way to get there. But he also gives his disciples another promise for the time in between. “I will ask the Father, and he will give you another Helper, to be with you forever, even the Spirit of truth” (14:16–17). They know Jesus, the right person, but they will have to wait before being with him in the Father’s house. In the meantime, God will send the Holy Spirit. He will guide them, strengthen them, and bring them back to Jesus.

> [!important]+ Reflect and Respond
What, then, is the deepest comfort for believers when they face trouble? It is the hope of a place—being at home with God forever. It is the hope of a person—Jesus, the only Savior and the only way to the Father. And it is the hope of a promise—that the Holy Spirit lives with us now, leading us step by step. So in your times of trouble, pray to your Father in heaven. Ask him to help you hold on to this hope until the day you are with him.
