### <center>大祭司的祷告</center>

> [!info]- 🎙️Audio: [None]()

如果你读过莎士比亚的戏剧，就会知道他常常使用一种手法，叫做“独白”。在独白中，人物暂时脱离剧情，向观众倾吐内心最深的思绪。约翰福音第十七章，正是我们最接近耶稣“独白”的地方。这里，约翰为我们记下了耶稣向天父的祷告——人们称之为“大祭司的祷告”。那么，耶稣是如何祷告的呢？

首先，耶稣为自己祷告——求父使祂得着荣耀。这并不是自私的祈求。祂所求的，是祂与父一同得荣耀。祂说：“父啊，时候到了，愿你荣耀你的儿子，使儿子也荣耀你。”（17:1）耶稣的时刻到了——祂要走向十字架。祂的祷告，就是愿借着祂的死，得以被高举，使罪人得着永生，使上帝的名得着永远的颂赞。

接着，耶稣为门徒祷告。祂求父保守他们，使他们在真道中得以坚固。祂说：“求你因你所赐给我的名保守他们。”（17:11）祂求天父保护他们，脱离那恶者。更进一步，祂求父用真理的话使他们成圣。耶稣把祂所拣选的门徒，交托在天父全然完美的看顾之下，求祂保守他们的信心与心灵，直到最后。

最后，耶稣为未来一切信祂的人祷告。也就是说，在这里，耶稣为你、为我祷告。岂不是令人惊叹？在祂离世的前几个小时，祂仍眺望将来，记念一切会因祂而信的人。祂为我们所求的是什么呢？就是合一。祂求一切信祂的人，在信仰上能够合而为一。为什么呢？为了叫“世人知道你差了我来，也知道你爱他们如同爱我一样。”（17:23）耶稣渴望祂的子民在真道里合一，好让世人看见祂是真实慈爱的救主。

> [!important]+ 反思与回应
因此，让我们祷告，求神使我们在基督里与弟兄姊妹合一。求主帮助我们与教会、群体中真正承认耶稣为救主的人一同站立。也求神使用这合一，带领更多人归向这位救赎主。

### <center>The Highly Priestly Prayer</center>

> [!question]+ Review
> 1. In the metaphor of the vine and the branches, what does Jesus teach about the difference between true disciples and false ones?
> 2. Why can no one bear fruit apart from abiding in Jesus?
> 3. According to John 15:10, how can we remain in Jesus’s love?

📖 **Passage to read**: ==John 17==

> [!info]- 🎙️Audio: [None]()  

If you’ve ever read Shakespeare, you know he often uses a soliloquy. It’s when a character speaks directly to the audience to show what’s going on inside. John 17 is the closest thing we get to a soliloquy from Jesus. Here, John records Jesus’s prayer to the Father—a prayer often called “the high priestly prayer.” So what does Jesus pray?

First, Jesus prays for himself—that he would be glorified. This isn’t selfish. What he asks is that both he and the Father would be glorified together. He says, “Father, the hour has come; glorify your Son that the Son may glorify you” (17:1). The hour is here—his death on the cross. And that death will bring glory. It will bring eternal life to sinners and eternal praise to God.

Next, Jesus prays for his disciples. He asks that God would guard them and keep them safe. He prays, “Keep them in your name” (17:11). He asks that they be protected from the evil one. More than that, he asks that they be sanctified—made holy—by God’s word of truth. Jesus entrusts his disciples into the Father’s care, asking him to guard their faith and their hearts until the end.

Finally, Jesus prays for all believers who will come to trust in him in the future. That means he was praying for you and me. Isn’t that amazing? Just hours before his death, Jesus was thinking about future believers. And what does he pray for us? Unity. He prays that all who follow him would be one in their faith in him. Why? So that “the world may know that you sent me and loved them even as you loved me” (17:23). Jesus wants his people to be united, so that the world can see the truth of who he is and the love he brings.

> [!important]+ Reflect and Respond
So pray for unity in Christ with other believers. Ask God to help you stand together with Christians in your church and your community—those who confess Jesus as Lord. And pray that God would use that unity to draw even more people to the Savior.
