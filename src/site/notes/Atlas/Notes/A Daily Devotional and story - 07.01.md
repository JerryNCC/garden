# **July 01 -** **God Hears Our Cries**

In Psalm 22, David feels very sad. He cries, “My God, why have You left me?” (Psalm 22:1). People laugh at him because he trusts God. He feels alone, like enemies are all around him. But David does not give up. He remembers God is good and faithful.

David prays to God. He says, “You are holy” (Psalm 22:3). He knows God helped him before, even from when he was a baby. David trusts God will help him again. At the end of the psalm, David praises God. He believes God will save him.

This psalm is special. It tells about Jesus, God’s Son, on the cross. Jesus said, “My God, why have You forsaken me?” when He suffered. People mocked Him, and soldiers took His clothes. Jesus felt great pain to save us from our sins. But the story does not end sadly. Jesus rose from the dead! His victory brings joy to many people.

Psalm 22 shows us we can pray when we are sad. God listens. Jesus took our punishment so we can be close to God. We should thank Him for His love.

# **The Boy Who Prayed**

Ben lives in a small village. He loves playing football, but some boys at school laugh at him. They say, “Ben, you’re weak!” Ben feels sad and alone. One night, he sits in his room and cries. “God, why don’t You help me?” he asks.

Ben’s sister, Mary, sees him. She says, “Let’s read the Bible. Psalm 22 can help.” Ben opens the Bible. He reads about David, who felt sad too. David said, “My God, why have You left me?” (Psalm 22:1). But David kept praying. He trusted God.

Ben thinks about Jesus. His teacher told him Jesus suffered on the cross. People laughed at Jesus, but He trusted God. Jesus died to save everyone, and then He rose again. This makes Ben feel strong. “Jesus understands me,” Ben says.

That night, Ben prays, “God, I’m sad, but I trust You. Thank You for Jesus.” The next day, Ben feels braver. He plays football and smiles, even when the boys laugh. He knows God is with him. Ben tells Mary, “God hears me, just like He heard David and Jesus.”

**Reflection and Prayer Questions:**

1. When do you feel sad or alone? Pray and tell God how you feel, and ask Him to help you trust Him.
2. Why is Jesus’ suffering on the cross important to you? Thank Jesus for taking your punishment.
3. How can you praise God, even when things are hard? Ask God to give you strength to keep praying.
