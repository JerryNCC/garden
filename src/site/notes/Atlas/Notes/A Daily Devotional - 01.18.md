### <center>每一个细节</center>

> [!info]- 🎙️Audio: [A Daily Devotional - 01.17 - CN]()

创世记第24章讲述了以撒如何找到妻子的迷人故事，全篇共有六十七节经文。尽管每个细节都值得深入探讨，但我们先聚焦于故事开头的九节经文，这是整篇叙述的基础。  

此时，亚伯拉罕已是年迈之人，生命即将走到尽头。然而，他仍然紧握神多年前赐下的应许：他的后代将承受他眼前的这片土地。即使有了这份保证，亚伯拉罕仍对两件事感到担忧。  

首先，亚伯拉罕不希望以撒娶迦南女子为妻。这片土地上的人敬拜偶像而非真神，若以撒与他们结合，可能会使他远离自己的信仰。  

其次，亚伯拉罕担心如果以撒从家乡娶妻，那位妻子可能会劝说以撒返回她熟悉的家乡，而不是留在神应许给亚伯拉罕后代的土地上。尽管亚伯拉罕信靠神的信实，他也明白，以撒选择的妻子将对他的后代产生深远影响。  

接下来的经文展现了一个令人惊叹的事实：神掌管着这个故事中的每一个细节。他以至高无上的主权引导每一件事，成就了他对亚伯拉罕的应许。没有任何事情是偶然发生的——连亚伯拉罕的仆人在井边遇见利百加的那一刻也不例外。神亲自引导仆人找到最合适的妻子：利百加不仅出自亚伯拉罕的族人，还愿意离开自己的家，加入以撒的生活，留在神所召的土地上。正因如此，亚伯拉罕的后代得以在应许之地繁衍生息。这一切，神都确保了它的实现。  

> [!important]+ 反思与回应
> 你是否曾忘记神也参与到你生命中的每一个小细节里？今天花点时间感谢他，因为他知道你生命中的每一个部分，甚至是你头上的每一根头发。如果你属于耶稣，就可以安心依靠罗马书8章28节的应许：神使万事都互相效力，叫爱他的人得益处，就是按他旨意被召的人。

### <center>Every Little Detail</center>

> [!question]+ Review
> 1. How does the birth of Isaac demonstrate God's faithfulness and grace?
> 2. What kind of grace is shown in God's promise to Ishmael and his descendants?
> 3. What kind of grace is shown in God's promise to Ishmael and his descendants?

📖 **Passage to read**: ==Genesis 24==

> [!info]- 🎙️Audio: [A Daily Devotional - 01.18 - EN]()


Genesis 24 is a captivating story about how Isaac finds a wife, told across sixty-seven verses. While it’s tempting to dive into every part of this rich narrative, let’s focus on the foundation laid in the first nine verses.  

At this point, Abraham is an old man, nearing the end of his life. But he still clings to God’s promise—the same one given to him years ago: that his descendants would inherit the land around him. Even with this assurance, Abraham is concerned about two potential problems.  

First, Abraham doesn’t want Isaac to marry a Canaanite woman. The people in the land worship idols, not God, and this could lead Isaac away from his faith.  

Second, Abraham worries about Isaac returning to his family’s homeland if he marries a woman from there. A wife might convince Isaac to stay in her familiar surroundings rather than live in the land God had promised Abraham’s family. While Abraham trusts God’s faithfulness, he knows that Isaac’s choice of a wife will have lasting effects on his descendants.  

The rest of the chapter shows us something amazing: God is in control of every detail of this story. He sovereignly works through each event to fulfill his promise to Abraham. Nothing happens by accident—not even the moment Abraham’s servant meets Rebekah at the well. God leads the servant to find the perfect wife for Isaac. Rebekah comes from Abraham’s people but is willing to leave her home to join Isaac in the land God has called him to. Because of this, Abraham’s family will continue to grow and flourish in the promised land. God makes sure of it.  

> [!important]+ Reflect and Respond
Do you ever forget that God is involved in the small details of your life? Take a moment today to thank him for knowing every part of your story—even the hairs on your head. If you belong to Jesus, you can rest in the promise of Romans 8:28: God is working all things “together for good, for those who are called according to his purpose.”
