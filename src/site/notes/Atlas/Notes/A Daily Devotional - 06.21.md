### <center>当恶人享福时</center>

> [!info]- 🎙️Audio: [A Daily Devotional - 06.21 - CN]()

有时候，世界看起来真是颠倒了。我们看到那些富有又出名的人，做出愚昧甚至不道德的事——而且他们似乎因此变得更富有、更出名。那些贪婪、暴虐的领导者似乎权势日增。与此同时，忠心的基督徒却遭遇疾病、挣扎，甚至离世。全世界的信徒因为信仰受逼迫、被囚禁。我们紧紧抓住神的话语，相信祂为这一切都有完美且美好的计划。我们也相信那位伟大的审判主耶稣，终有一日会公义地审判万事。然而，等待这一天，有时确实很难。

约伯正是针对这个问题，回应他朋友们的说法。他们不断重复同一个观点：约伯受苦，是因为他必定是恶人，或者犯了极大的罪。恶人必遭惩罚，所以约伯受苦，必是恶人。约伯终于反驳他们，叫他们看看周围的世界。恶人真的总是受罚吗？义人真的总是过着完美的生活吗？绝对不是！他说：“恶人为何存活，年纪增长，势力强盛呢？”（约伯记21:7）他们中间有些人，不仅今生享福，还被同辈们尊敬怀念：“他们平安地度日，安然入阴间。”（21:13）约伯说的是我们亲眼所见的事实：有些极恶的人，生活安逸，甚至备受尊荣。

我们常常疑惑：“神怎能让那恶人如此顺利、幸福？”朋友啊，神的计划远远超越今生。他有更大的、永恒的安排。终有一日，耶稣这位审判主要来到，将义人和恶人分开（太25:32），将爱祂的与拒绝祂的分别开来。在那之前，神的旨意在世上以我们无法完全看见或明白的方式实行。我们的责任，就是像约伯一样信靠祂。

> [!important]+ 反思与回应
求神帮助你信靠祂的美好计划——即使你看到恶人亨通，义人受苦。求神赐你永恒的眼光，让你在耶稣里安息——祂是万人的大救主与审判主。

### <center>When Good Things Happen to Bad People</center>

> [!question]+ Review
> 1. Why does Job call his friends “useless doctors”? What was wrong with their diagnosis? (Job 13:4)
> 2. How does Philippians 2 describe Jesus’ humility? How is this different from the attitude of Job’s friends? (Philippians 2:6-7)
> 3. After rejecting his friends’ accusations, how does Job express his attitude toward God? What does this teach us about relating to God during suffering? (Job 13:20)


📖 **Passage to read**: ==Job 20==

> [!info]- 🎙️Audio: [A Daily Devotional - 06.21 - EN]()  


Sometimes, the world feels upside down. We see rich and famous people doing foolish or immoral things—and somehow, they get even richer and more famous. Leaders who are greedy or violent seem to gain more power. Meanwhile, faithful Christians get sick, struggle, and sometimes even die. Believers all over the world face persecution and imprisonment because of their faith. We hold on to God’s word, trusting that He has a perfect and good plan for all of this. We believe that Jesus, the great Judge, will one day set things right. But waiting for that can be really hard.

Job speaks right into this problem when he responds to his friends’ arguments. They keep saying the same thing: Job is suffering because he must be wicked or has done something very sinful. They argue that wicked people always get punished. So, since Job is suffering, he must be wicked. Job finally pushes back, urging them to look around the world. Do wicked people always get punished? Do the righteous always live perfect lives? Absolutely not! “Why do the wicked live, reach old age, and grow mighty in power?” he asks (Job 21:7). Some even enjoy great success and are remembered with honor: “They spend their days in prosperity, and in peace they go down to Sheol” (21:13). Job is pointing out something we all know from experience: some very evil people live comfortable, even honored lives.

We often wonder, “How can God allow such people to succeed and be happy?” Friend, God is working out a plan far bigger than this life alone. One day, Jesus the Judge will come and separate the righteous from the wicked (Matt. 25:32)—those who love Him from those who reject Him. Until then, God’s plan unfolds in ways we cannot fully see or understand. Our job is to trust Him, just like Job did.

> [!important]+ Reflect and Respond
Ask God to help you trust His perfect plan—even when you see wicked people prosper and godly people suffer. Pray for an eternal view, and rest in Jesus, the great Savior and Judge of all.
