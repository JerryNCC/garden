### <center>君王的降生</center>

> [!info]- 🎙️Audio: [None]()

当我们想到耶稣的降生时，许多人会立刻联想到马槽的景象。然而，马太并没有记载这一部分。他的焦点不同，他要我们看见：耶稣就是那位应许的君王，弥赛亚，来治理神的子民。

首先，马太指出，这位君王的诞生在人类历史上独一无二。耶稣因圣灵的大能怀在马利亚腹中。祂确实是真实的人，却不是因男女结合而生。约瑟与马利亚已经订婚，却发现她怀了孕，便想暗暗退婚。但主的使者在梦中向他显现，告诉他这孩子是从圣灵怀的。从起初，这位君王的降生就彰显神奇妙的作为。

其次，马太要我们明白，耶稣的降生正是神古时应许的成就。天使吩咐约瑟给孩子起名叫“耶稣”，因为“他要将自己的百姓从罪恶里救出来”（马太福音1:21）。这救恩早已由先知宣告。于是马太引用以赛亚的话，说必有童女怀孕生子。马利亚的孩子正是这应许的应验。后来，东方博士来到犹太，祭司和文士引用先知弥迦的话，指出弥赛亚必生在伯利恒。马太要我们看见：神一切的应许，都在耶稣这一个人身上实现了。

最后，马太呈现出人对这位君王的不同回应。东方博士不远千里而来，俯伏敬拜，并献上礼物。但犹太的王希律却把耶稣视为威胁，想要除灭祂。同一位君王，有人因祂而满心喜乐敬拜，有人却因祂而惧怕拒绝。

> [!important]+ 反思与回应
马太把选择摆在我们面前。博士们给我们立下榜样：他们满心喜乐地俯伏在耶稣面前，将最好的献上。神今天也呼召我们如此行。你是否已经在心里迎接了这位君王？祈求神赐下恩典，使我们能以喜乐来回应耶稣，这位将祂百姓从罪恶中拯救出来的君王。

### <center>The Birth of the King</center>

> [!question]+ Review
> 1.⁠ ⁠Why does Matthew begin his Gospel with the genealogy of Jesus?
2.⁠ ⁠What do David and Ruth’s presence in the genealogy remind us of?
3.⁠ ⁠How does the structure of the genealogy point to Jesus as the turning point in God’s plan of salvation?

📖 **Passage to read**: ==Matthew 01:01-17==

> [!info]- 🎙️Audio: [None]()  

When we think about Jesus’s birth, many of us picture the manger scene. But Matthew doesn’t tell that part of the story. His focus is different. He wants us to see Jesus as the promised King, the Messiah who has come to reign over God’s people.

First, Matthew shows us that this King is born in a way unlike anyone else in history. By the power of the Holy Spirit, Jesus is conceived in Mary’s womb. He is truly human, but not the result of a man and a woman joining together. Joseph, who was engaged to Mary, learns of her pregnancy and quietly plans to leave. But the angel of the Lord comes to him and explains that this child is from the Holy Spirit. From the very beginning, the birth of this King is marked by God’s miracle.

Second, Matthew wants us to see that the birth of Jesus is the fulfillment of God’s promises long ago. The angel tells Joseph that the boy’s name will be Jesus, “because he will save his people from their sins” (1:21). This salvation was promised by the prophets. Then Matthew quotes Isaiah, who spoke of a virgin conceiving and bearing a son. Mary’s child is the fulfillment of that word. Later, when wise men come from the east, the priests point to Micah’s prophecy to identify the place of his birth. In all of this, Matthew is showing that God’s promises are being kept in this one person—Jesus.

Finally, Matthew presents the different responses to this King. The wise men make a long journey to worship him, bowing down and offering gifts. But Herod, the ruler in Judea, sees Jesus as a threat. He seeks to destroy him. The same King brings joy and worship to some, and fear and rejection to others.

> [!important]+ Reflect and Respond
Matthew leaves us with a choice. The wise men show us the right response: to bow before Jesus with joy and to give him what we have. God calls us to do the same. Have you welcomed this King in your heart? Pray for grace to respond with joy to Jesus, the King who came to save us from our sins.
