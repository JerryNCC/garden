### <center>神与约瑟同在</center>

> [!info]- 🎙️Audio: [A Daily Devotional - 01.27 - CN]()

上一次我们看到约瑟时，他被卖为奴，进入了埃及护卫长波提乏的家。然而，在《创世记》第39章的开头，我们见证了一个奇妙的事实：神并没有忘记约瑟。事实上，神与他同在，大大地赐福于他，以至于约瑟很快就成为波提乏最信任的仆人。如果你回想《创世记》第38章——犹大家族那充满罪恶与混乱的故事——约瑟的处境与他哥哥的形成了鲜明对比。尽管身陷困境，神的同在让约瑟的境遇变得完全不同。  

我们还了解到，约瑟是一位英俊的年轻人。波提乏的妻子注意到了这一点，并开始试图引诱他。她一次又一次地逼迫约瑟，但他始终拒绝，持守对神的忠心和自己的正直。最终，约瑟选择尽量避开她。然而，波提乏的妻子并不甘心。某天，当约瑟逃离她时，留下了他的外衣，她便利用这一点，诬告约瑟企图侵犯她。波提乏听信了妻子的话，将约瑟关进了监牢。  

试想此时的约瑟会有怎样的感受。他已经被哥哥出卖，抛入坑中，又被卖为奴隶。当生活似乎刚有起色时，他却因莫须有的指控再次入狱。或许他会想：“神啊，您是在开玩笑吗？我还没受够吗？”  

然而，即便在监牢中，神也没有离弃约瑟。正如本章结尾所展现的那样，神的手再次显现。约瑟得到了狱卒的青睐，很快被委以管理其他囚犯的重任。即便在最黑暗的地方，神依旧与约瑟同在。而通过这一切，神正在为祂伟大的计划铺路，要借着忠心的仆人约瑟，拯救并赐福祂的子民。  

> [!important]+ 反思与回应
你是否曾觉得生活就像接二连三的坏运气？约瑟的故事提醒我们，即使在最艰难的时刻，神仍然在掌管。祂有一个计划，要拯救并赐福祂的子民，而这其中也包括你。今天花些时间向神祈求信心，无论你正面临怎样的挑战，都信靠祂。赞美祂的信实，因为祂始终与祂的子民同在——即便是在最困难的时刻。

### <center>God Is with Joseph

📖 **Passage to read**: ==Genesis 39==

> [!info]- 🎙️Audio: [A Daily Devotional - 01.27 - EN]()

When we last saw Joseph, he was being sold as a slave into the household of Potiphar, the captain of the Egyptian guard. At the start of chapter 39, we see something amazing: God hasn’t forgotten Joseph. In fact, God is with him, blessing him so much that Joseph quickly rises to become Potiphar’s most trusted servant. If you think back to Genesis 38—the messy, sinful story of Judah and his family—it’s clear that Joseph’s situation is a striking contrast. Despite his circumstances, God’s presence with Joseph makes all the difference.  

We also learn that Joseph is a handsome young man. Potiphar’s wife takes notice and starts trying to seduce him. Over and over, she pressures Joseph, but he refuses, staying committed to God and his integrity. Eventually, he tries to avoid her altogether. But Potiphar’s wife doesn’t give up. One day, when Joseph flees from her, leaving his coat behind, she uses it to falsely accuse him of assaulting her. Potiphar believes his wife and has Joseph thrown into prison.  

Imagine how Joseph must have felt at that point. He’d already been betrayed by his brothers, thrown into a pit, and sold into slavery. Just when life seemed to be improving, he’s falsely accused and imprisoned. It would be easy to think, “Really, God? Haven’t I had enough already?”  

But even in prison, God doesn’t leave Joseph. As the chapter ends, we see God’s hand at work again. Joseph finds favor with the prison warden and is soon put in charge of the other prisoners. God is still with him, even in the darkest places. And through all of this, God is preparing to use Joseph to save and bless His people in a big way.  

> [!important]+ Reflect and Respond
Do you ever feel like life is just one setback after another? Joseph’s story reminds us that even in the hardest times, God is still at work. He has a plan to save and bless His people, and that includes you. Take a moment today to ask God for faith to trust Him, no matter what challenges you’re facing. Praise Him for His faithfulness, knowing that He is always with His people—even in the hardest moments.
