### <center>罪人审判与义人的拯救</center>

> [!info]- 🎙️Audio: [A Daily Devotional - 01.04 - CN]()


你还记得那些动物排队上挪亚方舟的儿童歌曲吗？它们很可爱、欢乐，有歌词讲述着动物们成双成对地登上方舟。我们中的许多人唱着这些歌，脸上露出大大的微笑！虽然这些歌很愉快，但它们并不能完全捕捉创世记第6和第7章的精髓。为什么？因为挪亚方舟的故事本质上是一个关于神公义且严厉审判人类罪恶的故事。

创世记第6章告诉我们，地上充满了暴力和腐败，神都看在眼里。他不是瞎子，他看得清清楚楚。这个无比圣洁的创造者厌恶罪恶。当人类得罪这样一位圣洁的神时，就意味着审判，最终导致死亡。这正是神对挪亚所揭示的：“我决定结束所有的肉体，因为地充满了他们的暴力。”（6:13）这是关于神的一个重要真理——你的创造者。他是圣洁的，他厌恶罪恶，我们的罪带来审判和死亡。

创世记的这些章节充满了死亡、毁灭和审判。但我们在这段经文中也看到了一个至关重要的模式：即使神公义地审判罪恶，他总是为那些敬畏他并在他眼中活得义的人提供救赎之道。“挪亚是个义人，在他的时代是个无瑕之人。挪亚与神同行。”（6:9）挪亚并不是完美的人，但他活在神的恩典中。这使他成为义人。

在这段经文中，我们还首次发现了一个特殊的词汇，它将在整个圣经故事中反复出现：契约。神告诉挪亚，这位在神眼中蒙恩的义人，他将与他立约——一个承诺。神承诺拯救挪亚，拯救他的家庭，并向他们显示恩典。


> [!important]+ 反思与回应
思考神的圣洁。神厌恶罪恶。神将审判罪恶。今天就向神认罪——具体些！在你认罪时，记得神已经向你显示了恩典。今天感谢神，因为耶稣的舍命救赎你脱离神的审判。

### <center>Judgment of Sinners and Rescue of the Righteous</center>

> [!question]+ Review
> 1. What command did God give to Adam and Eve, and how did this command relate to His intention for humanity?
> 2. How did the multiplication of Adam and Eve’s descendants lead to more evil according to Genesis 6?
> 3. Who found favor with God in the midst of all the evil, and what did that mean for humanity?

📖 **Passage to read**: ==Genesis 06:9 - 07.24==

Do you remember singing children’s songs about the animals marching onto Noah’s ark? They were cute and happy, with lyrics about pairs of animals boarding the ark. Many of us sang those songs with big smiles on our faces! While they are enjoyable, they don’t really capture the essence of Genesis 6 and 7. Why? Because the story of Noah and the ark is fundamentally a story about God’s righteous and severe judgment against human sin.

Genesis 6 tells us that the earth was filled with violence and corruption, and God saw it all. He isn’t blind to what’s happening; He sees everything clearly. This infinitely holy Creator of all things hates sin. When humans sin against such a holy God, it means judgment and ultimately death. This is what God reveals to Noah: “I have determined to make an end of all flesh, for the earth is filled with violence through them” (6:13). This is an important truth about God—your Creator. He is holy, He hates sin, and our sin brings judgment and death.

These chapters in Genesis are full of death, destruction, and judgment. But what we also see here is the start of an essential pattern: even as God righteously judges sin, He always provides a way of rescue for those who fear Him and live righteously in His eyes. “Noah was a righteous man, blameless in his generation. Noah walked with God” (6:9). Noah wasn’t perfect, but he lived in God’s grace. This made him righteous.

In this passage, we also find the first mention of a special word that will reappear throughout the Bible: covenant. God tells Noah, this righteous man favored by God, that He will make a covenant with him—a promise. God promises to save Noah, to rescue him and his family, and to show them grace.

> [!important]+ Reflect and Respond
> Think about the holiness of God. God hates sin. God will judge sin. Confess your sins to God today—be specific! As you do, remember that God has shown grace to you. Thank God today for Jesus, whose death in your place rescues you from God’s judgment.
