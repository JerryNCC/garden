### <center>耶稣加其他”式的基督教</center>

> [!info]- 🎙️Audio: [None]()


在跟随基督的道路上，有一种危险非常微妙，很容易被忽略。它不会直接诱使你拒绝耶稣。实际上，它承认耶稣是救主，甚至听起来非常“基督徒化”。这种危险就是所谓的“耶稣加其他”式的基督教——认为除了耶稣之外，你还需要依靠其他东西才能讨神喜悦，才能过真正属灵的生活。这种想法承认耶稣是罪人的救主，却否认祂是你信心和顺服生活真正的支撑者。

这种“加其他”的做法形式多样，但最常见的就是律法主义。我们本来是靠神的恩典开始信仰，却渐渐认为必须通过善行、教会出席或个人灵修来维持神的喜悦。这不是圣经所教导的信心，而是“耶稣加其他”，而非单靠基督。

这种危险在古代加拉太的信徒中真实存在。有些犹太教师告诉外邦信徒，得救需要耶稣加上遵守犹太习俗、仪式和律法。他们说，耶稣固然是得救的必要条件，但要完全得救，还必须遵守律法。

保罗对此强烈反应。他为外邦信徒接受这种有害教导而感到痛心。他问道：“你们既靠圣灵开始，岂还靠肉体成全吗？”（3:3）。“耶稣加其他”的教导诱使那些本来单靠基督开始信仰的基督徒，把依靠转向自己的能力、努力和行为，以维持与神的关系。对保罗来说，这是严重的威胁——因为唯靠恩典的福音在此受到挑战。

> [!important]+ 反思与回应
你是否在自己的生命中，也感受到“耶稣加其他”的诱惑？我们有时都会经历。祈求神提醒你：你是靠祂奇妙的恩典得救，也是靠这恩典在日常生活中忠心事奉。求神赐你力量，信靠耶稣得救，也天天信靠祂来活出敬虔的生活。

### <center>Jesus Plus” Christianity</center>

> [!question]+ Review
> 


📖 **Passage to read**: ==Galatians 02.05-03.14==

> [!info]- 🎙️Audio: [None]()  


One of the most subtle dangers in following Christ is easy to miss. It doesn’t tempt you to reject Jesus. In fact, it acknowledges Him as Savior and even sounds very “Christian.” The danger is what we might call “Jesus plus” Christianity—a belief that you need Jesus plus something else to please God or to live a truly spiritual life. This kind of thinking accepts Jesus as the Savior of sinners but denies Him as the true Sustainer of your faith and obedience.

This “plus” can take many forms. Most commonly, it looks like legalism. We start by trusting God’s grace, but then we slip into thinking that we maintain His favor through good works, church attendance, or personal devotions. That is not biblical faith—it is “Jesus plus,” not Christ alone.

This danger was real for the believers in Galatia. Certain Jewish teachers told Gentile Christians that salvation required Jesus plus Jewish customs, rituals, and laws. Yes, Jesus was necessary for salvation, they said—but following the Jewish law was also required to be fully saved.

Paul responds strongly. He is devastated that Gentile believers are embracing this destructive teaching. He asks, “Having begun by the Spirit, are you now being perfected by the flesh?” (3:3). The “Jesus plus” message tempts Christians who start by trusting Christ alone to shift their reliance onto their own power, effort, and goodness to grow in their relationship with God. For Paul, this was a serious threat—because the gospel of grace alone is at stake.

> [!important]+ Reflect and Respond
Do you feel the pull of “Jesus plus” thinking in your life? We all do, at times. Pray that God would remind you of the amazing grace by which you are saved, and by which you live faithfully. Ask Him for strength to trust Jesus for salvation—and to keep trusting Him every day to live for Him.
