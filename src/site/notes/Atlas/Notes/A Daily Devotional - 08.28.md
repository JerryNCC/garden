### <center>与你的神同行要存谦卑的心</center>

> [!info]- 🎙️Audio: [None]()


弥迦书 6:1–8 是许多人耳熟能详的经文。但正因如此，反而隐藏着危险。经文若过于熟悉，我们就容易误解。弥迦书 6:8 并不是教导神的百姓如何靠行为得救，而是说明已经蒙救赎的人该如何回应神的恩典。

弥迦一开始就提出指控，如同在法庭上宣判。神亲自作审判官，指责祂子民的罪恶。以色列人又一次悖逆了。然而，留意神是如何提出祂的控告。祂提醒他们自己所行过的拯救之工：“我曾将你从埃及地领上来，从作奴之家赎回你们”（6:4）。重点不在于以色列人如何赚得救恩，而在于神已经施行的救恩。祂拯救了他们，赎回了他们，并带领他们进入祂的约中。问题是：他们如今该如何活，才能与这救恩相称呢？

百姓的反应是倚靠礼仪。这在本章中清楚可见。他们问：“耶和华岂喜悦千千的公羊，或是万万的油河吗？”（6:7）难道神要的是无穷无尽的祭牲？甚至要人将儿女献上？他们似乎以为，只要做对了礼仪，神就会满足。

但答案显然是否定的。神从未只要礼仪本身。献祭固然是律法的吩咐，却不是神所看重的中心。祂所要的，是祂的子民自己。这就是第 8 节明白说出的：耶和华向蒙祂救赎的人所要的是什么？就是行公义，好怜悯，存谦卑的心，与祂同行。这不是外在的形式，而是一种全心献上的生命，对救赎主满有忠诚。

> [!important]+ 反思与回应
神不要仅仅是宗教的表象。祂要的是我们的心。想一想，你是否曾依赖某些礼仪、习惯，或外在的敬虔表现，好像这些能取代真正的奉献？向神承认吧。祈求祂引导你，使你越来越完全地将自己交托给祂——这位创造你、爱你，并藉着祂的爱子救赎你的神。

> [!question]+ Review
> 1.⁠ ⁠How does Micah 5 prophesy the origin of the “Shepherd-King”? In what ways is his rule different from that of ordinary kings?
2.⁠ ⁠How does the prophet Micah describe the Shepherd-King’s dealing with idolatry and rebellious nations? What reminder does this give God’s people about living a holy life?
3.⁠ ⁠In Matthew 2, how does the visit of the Magi confirm Micah’s prophecy? How can we practically acknowledge Jesus as our Shepherd-King in our daily lives today?

📖 **Passage to read**: ==Micah 06.01-08==

> [!info]- 🎙️Audio: [None]()  



Micah 6:1–8 is one of those passages many of us know well. And that can be dangerous. When a verse becomes familiar, we may begin to take it the wrong way. Micah 6:8 is not a verse about how God’s people can earn salvation. Rather, it tells us how those who have already been saved are to respond.

Micah starts with an accusation, almost like a courtroom charge. God speaks to his people as the judge, declaring their guilt. Israel is rebellious again. But notice how God makes his case. He reminds them of what he has already done for them: “I brought you up from the land of Egypt and redeemed you from the house of slavery” (6:4). The focus is not on what Israel must do to earn salvation, but on what God has already done to save. He rescued them, redeemed them, and brought them into his covenant service. The question is: How should they now live in light of that?

The people’s instinct is to turn to ritual. That’s what we see in this chapter. They ask: “Will the LORD be pleased with thousands of rams, with ten thousands of rivers of oil?” (6:7). Could God want endless sacrifices? Could he even want something as extreme as a child offered up? Surely, they think, the right ritual will satisfy him.

But the answer is clear: No. God has never wanted rituals for their own sake. Sacrifices were commanded, yes, but they were never the heart of the matter. What God desires is his people themselves. That is what verse 8 says so plainly. What does the LORD require of those he has redeemed? To act justly, to love mercy, and to walk humbly with him. These are not empty motions, but a life of devotion to the God who saves.

> [!important]+ Reflect and Respond
God does not want only outward signs of religion. He wants our hearts. Think of the ways you may have leaned on ritual, habit, or outward shows of piety as if they could take the place of true devotion. Confess them. Pray that God will lead you to give yourself to him more and more—he who has created you, loved you, and redeemed you through the work of his Son.
