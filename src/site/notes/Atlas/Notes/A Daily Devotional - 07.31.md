以赛亚书的前半部分——第一章到第三十九章——主要聚焦于神的审判。神的百姓一再犯罪，而以赛亚也不断发出警告，宣告他们将要面对的后果。然而，到了第四十章，语气出现了明显的转变。神开始向祂的百姓发出安慰与盼望之言。你一读第一节就能感受到这转变：“你们的　神说：你们要安慰，安慰我的百姓。”（赛40:1）这些话并不是对义人说的，而是对罪人说的，对那些在审判中受苦的人说的。即使在神的管教之中，祂仍然说：“安慰。”

接下来的话语更显出神的恩典：“要对耶路撒冷说安慰的话，也要向她宣告，说她争战的日子已满，她的罪孽赦免了。”（赛40:2）以赛亚宣告，将有一天，神要赦免祂百姓的罪。是的，他们会被掳到异地，也必经历苦难，但这并不是终局。神要施怜悯，不将他们全然灭绝，反要将他们带回，赦免他们的罪。

紧接着，是一幅关于神自己的异象。百姓所真正需要的，不只是从仇敌手中得释放，更是要清楚看见神的本体。他们需要记得神是何等伟大与美善。这就是先知的呼喊：“看哪，你们的　神！”（赛40:9）祂满有大能，掌权施行治理（赛40:10），却又温柔牧养自己的羊群：“祂必像牧人牧养自己的羊群。”（赛40:11）世上的偶像、人间的智慧与力量，都无法与这位神相比。祂无所不知，无所不察，既全能，也亲近。

以赛亚的信息是：即便在审判之中，仍有盼望；即便身处被掳之地，神仍在成就祂的计划。祂没有忘记祂的百姓，也没有放弃他们。因此，这一章的末尾，以赛亚为疲乏的人带来极大的鼓励：“但那等候耶和华的，必重新得力；他们必如鹰展翅上腾；他们奔跑却不困倦，行走却不疲乏。”（赛40:31）神应许凡等候祂的人，必重新得着力量。

> [!important]+ 反思与回应
所以，让我们来到祂面前，向祂承认我们的罪，信靠祂借着爱子所施的怜悯。仰望祂——这位既全能又慈爱的神。感谢祂，使我们可以亲近祂，与祂交通，甚至认识祂！

> [!question]+ Review
> 1. ⁠In Isaiah, how does the people's response to disaster (e.g., “The bricks have fallen, but we will build with dressed stones”) reveal their attitude? Why is this seen as sinful by God?
> 2. Through Isaiah, what specific sins does God accuse the people of (such as corrupt leadership, selfishness, and oppression)? What are the consequences of these sins?
> 3. Although God’s hand of judgment is still stretched out, how does the devotional point to His mercy and redemption? What does this mean for us today?

📖 **Passage to read**: ==Isaiah 40==

> [!info]- 🎙️Audio: [A Daily Devotional - 07.31 - EN]()  


The first part of Isaiah—chapters 1 through 39—is mostly about God’s judgment. His people had sinned again and again, and Isaiah warned them clearly about the coming consequences. But in chapter 40, something changes. The tone shifts. God begins to speak words of comfort and hope to his people. You can sense it right away: “Comfort, comfort my people, says your God” (40:1). These words are not spoken to perfect people. They’re spoken to sinners. To those who are hurting and under judgment. And yet, God says, “Comfort.”

The message continues with even more grace: “Speak tenderly to Jerusalem… her warfare is ended… her iniquity is pardoned” (40:2). Isaiah is saying that a day is coming when God will forgive their sins. Yes, they will go into exile. Yes, they will suffer. But that will not be the end. God will show mercy. He will not wipe them out completely. He will bring them back. He will pardon their sins.

And what comes next is a vision of God himself. The people don’t just need rescue from their enemies. They need to see God for who he is. They need to remember how great and good he is. That’s what the prophet tells them: “Behold your God!” (40:9). He is strong and mighty. He rules with power (40:10). But he is also gentle. “He will tend his flock like a shepherd” (40:11). No idol, no human wisdom or strength, can compare to this God. He knows everything. Nothing is hidden from him. And he is both powerful and near.

Isaiah is saying that there’s still hope. Even in judgment. Even in exile. God is still working out his plan. He hasn’t forgotten his people. He hasn’t given up. And so the chapter closes with a word of encouragement to those who are weary: “They who wait for the Lord shall renew their strength… they shall run and not be weary… they shall walk and not faint” (40:31). That’s what God gives to those who trust in him: renewed strength.

> [!important]+ Reflect and Respond
So come to him. Confess your sin. Trust the mercy that comes through his Son. Fix your eyes on him—this mighty and tender God. Thank him that you can know him, talk to him, and walk with him, even today.
