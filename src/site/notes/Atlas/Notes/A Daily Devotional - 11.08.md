### <center>严厉的责备</center>

> [!info]- 🎙️Audio: [None]()

想象一下，有一次你犯了错——也许你撞坏了车，违背了规矩，或对父亲撒了谎。于是父亲把你叫过来，语气严肃地责备你。可就在他训话到一半时，忽然开始轻声哼起一首上世纪六十年代的情歌——这情景是不是让人觉得又奇怪又出乎意料？其实，我们许多人读《哥林多前书》第十三章时，情形就有点类似。我们常在婚礼上听到这一章的经文，或把它装裱成诗挂在家中当作温柔的爱的颂歌。但保罗写这章经文时，并非要写一首浪漫的诗。

这“爱的篇章”出现在保罗整封信中最严厉的责备当中。哥林多教会问题重重——纷争、淫乱、自高自大。保罗在信中多次责备他们，呼吁他们要在基督里成熟长进。因此，他不可能突然停下训诫，转而写一首温情的诗。相反，他是在继续责备他们——只是换了另一种方式。他要指出什么才是真正的基督徒之爱，并让他们看见自己与这份爱的距离有多遥远。

从上下文来看，第十二章与第十四章都在讨论属灵恩赐，而第十三章正夹在其中。保罗写这段话，是要提醒哥林多人：爱比任何属灵恩赐都更重要。他们热衷于炫耀自己的恩赐——说方言、预言、行神迹——但保罗告诉他们，没有爱，这一切都毫无意义。真正属灵的标志，不在于恩赐的多少，而在于是否有爱。

请注意保罗如何描写“爱”。在第五章里，他已经指出他们因犯罪而自高自大；这里他写道：“爱是不自夸，不张狂”（13:4）。在第一、第二章中，他责备他们彼此纷争、互相争竞；而在这里他说：“爱不求自己的益处”（13:5）。哥林多信徒若读到这段话，一定会感到刺痛——因为他们被映照出来，原来自己离真正的爱那么远。

> [!important]+ 反思与回应
真正的基督徒成熟，不在于恩赐的显赫，而在于是否以爱来对待弟兄姊妹。信仰最真实的考验，不是你多有能力，而是基督的爱是否已改变了你的心与人际关系。求神使你在信靠那位完美爱你的救主耶稣时，也能学习祂的爱，在教会与群体中活出真诚的爱心。

### <center>A Stern Rebuke</center>

> [!question]+ Review
> 


📖 **Passage to read**: ==1 Corinthians 13==

> [!info]- 🎙️Audio: [None]()  

Think about a time when you did something wrong—maybe you crashed the car, broke a rule, or told a lie—and your father sat you down for a serious talk. Now imagine that, in the middle of his rebuke, he suddenly began singing a gentle love song from the 1960s. That would be strange, wouldn’t it? In a way, that’s how many people read 1 Corinthians 13. We often hear it at weddings or see it printed on plaques as a sweet reflection on love. But that isn’t how Paul meant it.

This “love chapter” comes in the middle of one of Paul’s sternest letters. The Corinthian church was full of problems—divisions, immorality, and pride. Paul had spent much of his letter correcting them and calling them to maturity. So it would make no sense for him to suddenly stop and write a sentimental poem about love. Instead, Paul is continuing his rebuke. He is showing them what real Christian love looks like—and how far they still are from it.

If you look at the context, chapters 12 and 14 are both about spiritual gifts. Chapter 13 fits right in the middle as Paul’s reminder that love is more important than any gift. The Corinthians were obsessed with showing off their spiritual abilities—speaking in tongues, prophesying, performing miracles—but Paul reminds them that none of these things matter without love. Love is the measure of true spirituality.

And notice how Paul describes love. In chapter 5, he had already called them arrogant about their sin. Here, he says love “is not arrogant” (13:4). Earlier, he confronted their divisions and selfish attitudes. Here, he says love “does not insist on its own way” (13:5). The Corinthians would have recognized themselves in these words—and they would have felt the sting. Paul wasn’t praising them; he was correcting them.

> [!important]+ Reflect and Respond
True Christian maturity is not measured by how gifted we are, but by how we love one another. The real test of faith is whether Christ’s love has shaped our hearts and our relationships. Pray that your faith in Jesus—the One who loved you perfectly—would grow into genuine love for others in your church and community.
