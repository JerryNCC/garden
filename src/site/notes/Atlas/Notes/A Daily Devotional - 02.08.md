### <center>燃烧的圣洁</center>

> [!info]- 🎙️Audio: [A Daily Devotional - 02.08 - CN]()

如果你是青少年，你可能更看重真实性——做“真我”——而不是外在的表现。你喜欢随性一些，因为你想做自己。然而，当这种随意的态度渗入我们与上帝的关系时，问题就出现了。在我们这个世界里，很容易忘记，上帝不仅是全能的，而且是令人敬畏的圣洁。

出埃及记这一章描述了一个惊人的时刻——一位圣洁的上帝通过祂所拣选的仆人摩西，将祂的话语赐给祂的子民。首先，上帝召摩西和一些领袖到祂面前，他们一起敬拜。接着，上帝单独召摩西上山，赐给他律法，这些律法将指引百姓如何跟随上帝。当摩西独自一人上山时，百姓在下面观看，他们看到耶和华的荣耀像“吞灭的火焰，显现在以色列人眼前”（出埃及记24:17）。上帝的圣洁是如此强烈，仿佛真的像火一样燃烧！四十天四十夜，百姓目睹着这位强大而圣洁的上帝，把祂的圣言传给摩西，让百姓都能遵循。

上帝是完全圣洁的，祂的圣洁让人无法承受。然而，尽管上帝如此强大和圣洁，祂的恩典却在这一章的每一个细节中彰显出来。那位无限圣洁的上帝选择接近这些有罪的人类。

看看以色列人对上帝话语的反应。他们说：“我们已经听见了你的话语，神，我们准备好做你所吩咐的一切！”这是正确的回应。我们也应该以这样的回应来面对我们那位圣洁的上帝，祂通过基督走近了我们。我们每天都应该这样说：“神，你要我们做什么，我们就做什么！”

> [!important]+ 反思与回应
今天，请花些时间思考那位创造了你的圣洁上帝——祂通过基督，恩待我们，走近我们。感谢祂的恩典。请求上帝帮助我们像出埃及记24章的以色列人一样回应：“神，我们听见了你的话语，我们愿意遵行！”

> [!question]+ Review
> 1.⁠ ⁠What preparations does God ask the people to make in Exodus 19? How is this related to the way they worship God?
> 2.⁠ ⁠Why does God first redeem His people and then give them the law? What kind of grace does this demonstrate from God?
> 3.⁠ ⁠What attitude do God's people have when they gather to listen to His word? What does this teach us about our faith life today?

📖 **Passage to read**: ==Exodus 20==

> [!info]- 🎙️Audio: [A Daily Devotional - 02.20 - EN]()  

If you're a teenager, you probably value authenticity—being “real”—over outward appearances. You like to be casual because you want to be yourself. But a problem can arise when this casual attitude crosses into our relationship with God. In our world, it’s easy to forget that God is not only powerful beyond measure, but also terrifyingly holy.  

This chapter in Exodus describes an amazing moment where a holy God gives His word to His people through Moses, His chosen servant. First, God calls Moses and some leaders to Himself, and they worship together. Then, God calls only Moses up to the mountain to receive the law, which will guide the people in following God. As Moses goes up alone, the people watch, and they see the glory of the Lord as “a devouring fire on the top of the mountain” (Exodus 24:17). God’s holiness is so intense that it literally burns like fire! For forty days and forty nights, the people stand in awe, watching this powerful and holy God deliver His holy word to Moses for all to follow.  

God is absolutely holy, and His holiness is overwhelming. Yet, even though God is so powerful and holy, His grace shines through in every moment of this chapter. The infinitely holy God chooses to come close to sinful people.  

Look at how the people of Israel respond to God’s word. They say, “We’ve heard your word, God, and we’re ready to do whatever you say!” This is the right response. It’s the response we should have to our holy God who has come near to us in Christ. We should be saying every day, “Whatever you want, God, we will do it!”  

> [!important]+ Reflect and Respond
Take a moment today to consider the holy God who made you—and who, through Christ, has graciously drawn near to you. Thank Him for this grace. Ask God to help you respond like the Israelites in Exodus 24: “God, we have heard your words, and we will obey them all!”
