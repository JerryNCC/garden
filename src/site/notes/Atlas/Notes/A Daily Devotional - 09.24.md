### <center>我们合理的信心</center>

> [!info]- 🎙️Audio: [None]()


路加写这本福音书时，目的明确、笔触稳健。一开始，他就说明，他要他的读者——一位名叫提阿非罗的人——确信自己所听见有关耶稣的事（1:4）。路加解释，他已经仔细查考这些事实，并有条理地整理出来（1:3）。他要提阿非罗，也要我们，看见信靠耶稣并不是盲目的跳跃，而是建立在真实事件和可靠见证上的合理信心。

路加还记载了其他福音书所没有的故事。若没有他，我们就会失去许多有关耶稣降生的细节。但路加的叙述更早开始，从施洗约翰的出生说起。故事在圣殿中展开，一位名叫撒迦利亚的祭司正在供职。他的妻子以利沙伯一直不能生育。当撒迦利亚在圣殿里服事时，有天使向他显现，宣告以利沙伯将要生一个儿子。这个孩子就是那位应许的先知，要在弥赛亚之前来临。天使说：“他必有以利亚的心志能力，行在主的前面，叫父亲的心转向儿女，叫悖逆的人转从义人的智慧，又为主预备合用的百姓。”（1:17）

然而，就连祭司也会在信心上软弱。撒迦利亚看着眼前的事实——自己年老，妻子也已上了年纪——实在无法相信这事会发生（1:18）。但神的计划不受人的限制，祂早已行过这样的奇事。因着撒迦利亚的疑惑，神给了他一个记号：在孩子出生以前，他将不能说话。即便如此，神仍满有恩慈，祂的应许不会落空。以利沙伯果然怀孕，那位为耶稣预备道路的孩子开始了他的生命。神伟大的救赎工作，从一个神迹拉开序幕。

祷告求神赐你对耶稣基督福音的确据，求祂坚固你的信心，因这位神是向罪人守约施慈爱的主。

### <center>Our Reasonable Faith</center>

> [!question]+ Review
> 1.⁠ ⁠How does the Gospel of Mark show that even Jesus’ closest followers struggled to believe in His resurrection?
2.⁠ ⁠What were Mary Magdalene, Mary the mother of James, and Salome expecting to find when they went to the tomb, and what does this reveal about their mindset?
3.⁠ ⁠What does it mean for our faith that we now have the complete testimony of the New Testament?

📖 **Passage to read**: ==Luke 01:01-25==

> [!info]- 🎙️Audio: [None]()  

Luke writes his gospel with a clear purpose and a steady hand. Right from the start, he tells us that he wants his reader, a man named Theophilus, to be sure about what he has heard about Jesus (1:4). Luke explains that he has carefully gathered the facts and arranged them in an orderly way (1:3). He wants Theophilus—and us—to see that faith in Jesus is not a blind leap. It is a reasonable trust built on real events and reliable witnesses.

Luke also gives us stories that no other gospel records. Without him, we would miss many of the details surrounding the birth of Jesus. But Luke begins even earlier, with the birth of John the Baptist. The story opens in the temple, where a priest named Zechariah is serving. His wife, Elizabeth, has never been able to have children. While Zechariah is on duty, an angel appears and announces that Elizabeth will bear a son. This child will be the promised prophet who goes before the Messiah. The angel says, “He will go before him in the spirit and power of Elijah, to turn the hearts of the fathers to the children, and the disobedient to the wisdom of the just, to make ready for the Lord a people prepared” (1:17).

But even a priest can struggle to believe. Zechariah looks at the facts—his own age and his wife’s—and cannot see how this could happen (1:18). Yet God’s plan is not stopped by human limits. He has done miracles like this before. Because Zechariah doubts, God gives him a sign: he will not be able to speak until the child is born. Even so, God remains kind. His promise stands. Elizabeth conceives, and the child who will prepare the way for Jesus begins his life. God’s great work of salvation moves forward, beginning with a miracle.

> [!important]+ Reflect and Respond
Pray that God will give you confidence in the good news of Jesus Christ. Ask him to strengthen your faith in the God who always keeps his promises to sinners.
