### <center>陶匠与泥土</center>

> [!info]- 🎙️Audio: [None]()

有时候，狗会试探它们的主人。有些品种，如英国拳师犬，就常有这样的行为。它们会突然冲向主人，摆出一副自己才是主人的架势。但通常只需一点点提醒，它们就会意识到谁才是真正的掌权者。这正是耶利米书第十八章所描绘的一幅小小画面：上帝借着陶匠与泥土的比喻，提醒祂的百姓，谁才是真正的主宰。

上帝吩咐耶利米下到陶匠的家中。耶利米看见陶匠在转轮上做器皿。若泥土做坏了，他就把它捏碎，重新做成别的器皿。然后，上帝向耶利米解释这异象的含义：“以色列家啊，我待你们，岂不能照这陶匠弄泥吗？”（耶18:6）。换句话说，上帝是陶匠，我们是泥土。祂有绝对的权柄按着自己的旨意塑造我们。因为祂创造了我们，祂知道什么才对我们最好。

但这位陶匠有一个奇妙的特质：祂并非粗暴无情地塑造我们。若祂手中的百姓愿意悔改，离弃罪恶归向祂，祂就应许要以慈爱待他们。上帝回应谦卑的心。当我们愿意被祂塑造时，祂就以温柔的手来成全祂的旨意。

这个比喻让我们看见，人类的悖逆实在是何等愚昧。泥土不能掌控陶匠，也无法命令陶匠要如何作为。泥土唯一的本分就是顺服陶匠的塑造。同样地，当人试图掌控自己的人生、不肯顺服上帝的引导时，就如同泥土想要自己塑造自己一样荒唐。

然而，这正是以色列民所犯的错。上帝甚至将他们的态度复述出来：“我们要照自己的计谋去行；我们各人要随自己顽梗的恶心去作事。”（耶18:12）。因为他们骄傲刚硬、不肯悔改，上帝宣告祂的审判将临到。他们宁可选择罪恶，也不愿信靠那位满有智慧和慈爱的创造主。

> [!important]+ 反思与回应
今天，请花一些时间感谢上帝，感谢祂在你悖逆时仍以忍耐和怜悯塑造你。感谢祂在基督里接纳了你。也求祂帮助你天天更深地信靠祂的手，甘愿顺服祂那美善、完全的旨意。

### <center>The Potter and His Clay</center>

> [!question]+ Review
> 1.⁠ ⁠In Jeremiah 5, why are the people under God’s judgment? How does God describe their rebellion and hardness of heart?
2.⁠ ⁠Even as God announces judgment, how does He also express mercy and hope? How does this shape our understanding of His character?
3.⁠ ⁠What is God seeking from us today in response to His call? How can you practically live out repentance and trust in your daily life?

📖 **Passage to read**: ==Jeremiah 18:01-18==

> [!info]- 🎙️Audio: [None]()  

Sometimes, dogs like to test their owners. Some breeds, like English boxers, are known for this. They’ll suddenly challenge their owners—charging at them, acting like they’re in control. But it usually doesn’t take much to remind the dog who really runs the house. That’s a small picture of what’s happening in Jeremiah 18. God uses the image of a potter and clay to remind his people who is really in charge.

God tells Jeremiah to go to a potter’s house. There, he sees the potter working with clay. When the clay doesn’t turn out the way he wants, the potter smashes it down and reshapes it into something else. Then God explains the meaning of what Jeremiah saw: “O house of Israel, can I not do with you as this potter has done?” (18:6). In other words, God is the potter. His people are the clay. He has every right to shape them the way he wants. He made them. He knows what’s best for them.

But there’s something amazing about this potter: he doesn’t shape the clay harshly or carelessly. If the people he’s shaping turn away from their sin and come back to him, he promises to deal with them in love. God responds to humble hearts. He shapes with gentleness when we’re willing to be shaped.

That image helps us see how silly and foolish rebellion really is. Clay doesn’t control the potter. It doesn’t have power to tell the potter what to do. Clay’s job is simply to be shaped. So when people try to take charge of their lives instead of submitting to God, it’s just as foolish as clay trying to mold itself.

But that’s exactly what the people of Israel do. God even repeats their attitude back to them: “We will follow our own plans, and will every one act according to the stubbornness of his evil heart” (18:12). Because of this proud and stubborn attitude, God says judgment will come. His people want to choose sin instead of trusting the wise and kind hands of their Maker.

> [!important]+ Reflect and Respond
Take time today to thank God for shaping your life with patience and mercy, even when you’ve resisted his good plans. Thank him for accepting you in Christ. Ask him to help you trust his hands more each day—to let him form you according to his good and perfect will.
