# **July 02 -** **God Is My Shepherd**

Psalm 23, written by David, shows us that God wants to be close to us. He is not just someone we learn about. He wants us to know Him like a friend.

David calls God his shepherd. A shepherd takes care of his sheep. God takes care of us. He gives us what we need, like food and rest. David says, “The Lord is my shepherd; I shall not want” (Psalm 23:1). This means God gives us everything we need. He leads us to good places, like green fields, and protects us from danger.

David also says God is like a kind host. He prepares a table for us, even when enemies are near (Psalm 23:5). God makes us feel safe and happy. David knows God’s love will stay with him forever.

God wants to be our shepherd too. Through Jesus, His Son, we can be close to God. Jesus died and rose again to bring us to God. We should pray to know God better and thank Him for His love.

# **The Lost Lamb**

Lila lives on a farm with her family. She loves the sheep in the fields. One day, a little lamb gets lost. Lila is worried. “Where is the lamb?” she asks. She looks everywhere, but it is dark, and she is scared.

At home, Lila’s father reads Psalm 23 from the Bible. “The Lord is my shepherd,” he reads (Psalm 23:1). “God is like a shepherd. He finds us when we are lost and keeps us safe.” Lila listens. She thinks about the lost lamb and prays, “God, please help the lamb. Help me know You like a shepherd.”

The next morning, Lila goes to the field. She finds the lamb in a green patch, eating grass. It is safe! Lila smiles and says, “God, You are my shepherd too!” She feels happy, knowing God watches over her, just like her father watches the sheep.

At church, Lila learns about Jesus. He is God’s Son who loves her. Jesus helps her be close to God. Lila prays, “Thank You, God, for being my shepherd. I want to know You more.” Every night, Lila looks at the stars and feels God’s love.
