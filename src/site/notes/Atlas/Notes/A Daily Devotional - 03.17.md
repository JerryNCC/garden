### <center>未完成的事业</center>

> [!info]- 🎙️Audio: [A Daily Devotional - 03.17 - CN]()

在《约书亚记》中，我们看到约书亚所取得的所有胜利。他带领神的子民击败了三十一位国王，他们的名字都在《约书亚记》12章中列出。这是一个令人印象深刻的成绩！约书亚是那个时代最适合的领袖，他凭借勇气和坚强的领导力，始终遵循神的话语，取得了显著的军事胜利。

然而，神对约书亚说了一句令人吃惊的话：“你年纪老迈，时日已晚，还有许多土地没有得着。”（13:1）尽管约书亚已经带领神的子民取得了许多胜利，但工作远未完成。还有许多敌国分布在这片土地上。尽管征服仍在继续，神却吩咐约书亚将土地——即使是未被征服的土地——分给以色列的十二个支派。神应许继续为以色列争战，祂说：“我必从以色列人面前赶出这些人。”（13:6）

此时，故事的下一章应该是更多胜利的继续，对吗？它应该描述以色列继续征服，直到整片土地完全从神的敌人手中解放出来，神的子民在和平中单独敬拜祂。可惜，接下来的故事并非如此。在《约书亚记》13:13中，我们读到：“然而以色列人没有赶出基述人和玛迦人。”这句话透露出过去的失败，接着说：“基述和玛迦人住在以色列人中，直到今日。”《约书亚记》的作者从未来的视角回望，告诉我们征服并没有完全完成。神的子民并没有把所有的外族人赶出，反而那些罪恶和拜偶像的民族被允许与神的子民同住。

> [!important]+ 反思与回应
征服的目标是要除去土地中的罪恶，使神的子民得以洁净，专心敬拜祂。这个原则在今天依然适用。耶稣在十字架上为我们赢得了最终的胜利，战胜了罪。所有跟随祂的人，都被召唤要把罪完全消灭，就像以色列被呼召要把罪从他们中间赶出去一样。我们已经得到了宽恕，因此我们不应再允许罪在我们中间存在。今天，祷告求神帮助你以警觉之心，靠着圣灵的力量，彻底摧毁困扰你的罪。

> [!question]+ Review
> 1. ⁠What is the symbolic significance of the actions Joshua and the Israelites took during the covenant renewal ceremony after the battle of Ai? What does this mean for today's believers?
> 2. ⁠Why did Joshua instruct the people to write God's law on the stones and stand in two groups on the two mountains during the covenant renewal ceremony? How did this impact the spiritual life of the Israelites?
> 3. What insights does the covenant renewal ceremony provide on how we live out God's Word today? How can we better obey God's Word in our daily lives?

📖 **Passage to read**: ==Joshua 12:07-13:13==

> [!info]- 🎙️Audio: [A Daily Devotional - 03.17 - EN]()  

In the book of Joshua, we read about all the victories Joshua achieved. He led the people of God to defeat thirty-one kings, and their names are listed in Joshua 12. This is quite an impressive record! Joshua was the right leader at the right time. His military success was a result of his courage and strong leadership, always following God's word.

But then God comes to Joshua and says something surprising: “You are old and advanced in years, and there remains yet very much land to possess” (13:1). Even though Joshua had led God’s people to many victories, the work was far from finished. There were still many enemy nations spread out across the land. However, despite the ongoing conquest, God tells Joshua to divide the land—yes, even the unconquered land—among the twelve tribes. God promises to continue fighting for Israel, saying, “I myself will drive them out from before the people of Israel” (13:6).

 At this point, the next chapter of the story should be one of even more victories, right? It should describe Israel continuing their conquest until the entire land is free of God’s enemies, with the people of God living in peace, worshipping Him alone. But that’s not what happens next. In Joshua 13:13, we read, “Yet the people of Israel did not drive out the Geshurites or the Maacathites.” This verse hints at past failure, as it continues: “Geshur and Maacath dwell in the midst of Israel to this day.” The writer of Joshua gives us a glimpse into the future, showing that the conquest wasn’t fully completed. The people didn’t drive out all the nations. Instead, sinful and idolatrous peoples were allowed to live among God’s people.

> [!important]+ Reflect and Respond
The goal of the conquest was to rid the land of sin, to purify God’s people, and set them apart for His worship. And this principle still applies to us today. Jesus’ death on the cross won the ultimate battle against sin. All who follow Him are called to put sin to death, just as Israel was called to drive out sin from their midst. We’ve been forgiven, and now we are to make sure that sin doesn’t remain among us. Pray today, asking God to help you fight and completely destroy the sin that tempts you, with the power of the Holy Spirit working in you!
