为什么好人会遭遇不幸？当我经历苦难时，是不是因为神在惩罚我？如果神真的爱我，为什么祂却让我承受这一切的痛苦？也许你曾经问过这些问题，也许你现在正陷在这样的疑问中。如果是这样，那么《约伯记》将是你当读的一本书。

《约伯记》属于圣经中的“智慧文学”。这类书卷以诗歌形式写成，语言生动、意象丰富，情感真挚，旨在教导神的子民如何以智慧而敬虔地生活。虽然我们不确知《约伯记》的作者是谁，但这卷书是文学的杰作，也深刻启示我们关于神的伟大以及人在苦难中当有的回应。

一开始，我们看到约伯是怎样的人。他被称为“完全正直”（约伯记1:1），敬畏神，远离恶事。他同时也是极其富有的人，财富之多远超我们大多数人的想象。然而，约伯并没有因富足而远离神，反而始终敬拜祂。他甚至常常为儿女献上燔祭，恐怕他们在心中得罪了神，可见他对神极其认真敬畏。

但约伯的安稳生活很快被打破。撒但，这位敌挡神、控告神子民的那一位，来到神的面前。神向撒但提起祂忠心的仆人约伯，而撒但却反驳说：“你若伸手毁他一切所有的，他必当面弃掉你”（约伯记1:11）。于是，出人意料的事情发生了：神许可撒但试炼约伯。

灾祸接踵而至。强盗抢走了约伯的牛和驴；火从天上降下，烧灭了他的羊群和仆人；接着，更多牲畜失踪。但最沉重的打击还在后头——房屋倒塌，约伯的儿女全部死去。

这样的苦难，几乎令人无法想象。一天之内失去如此多，恐怕世上没有几人曾经历这等悲痛。然而，更令人震惊的是，约伯并没有埋怨神。他俯伏在地敬拜，说：“赏赐的是耶和华，收取的也是耶和华；耶和华的名是应当称颂的！”（约伯记1:21）。约伯敬拜神，不是因着神所赐的好处，而是因着神的本为善与可敬。

> [!important]+ 反思与回应
今天，就向神祷告吧，求祂赐你一颗像约伯那样单纯爱祂的心——不是因为祂所给的恩典和顺境，而是因着祂自己。求祂开启你的眼睛，使你看见祂儿子耶稣的荣美，使祂成为你生命中至宝，即使在苦难中，也不动摇。

📖 **Passage to read**: ==Job 01==

> [!info]- 🎙️Audio: [A Daily Devotional - 06.16 - EN]()  

Why do bad things happen to good people? When something hard happens to me, is it because God is upset with me? If God really loves me, why is he letting me go through this pain? Maybe you’ve asked questions like these. Maybe you’re asking them right now. If so, the book of Job is a wise place to turn.

Job is part of what the Bible calls Wisdom Literature. These books are written in poetic and vivid language, full of imagery and feeling. They are meant to help God’s people live with wisdom. We don’t know exactly who wrote Job, but the book is powerful and beautiful. It teaches us deep things about God and about how we should respond to life’s hardest moments.

The book begins by showing us the kind of man Job is. He’s called “blameless and upright” (1:1). He fears God and turns away from sin. On top of that, he’s incredibly wealthy—far richer than most people could ever dream. But Job doesn’t let his wealth pull him away from God. Instead, he continues to worship, and even offers sacrifices for his children in case they have sinned. He takes God seriously in everything.

But Job’s life doesn’t stay peaceful. Satan, who stands against God and accuses His people, comes before the Lord. God points out Job as a faithful servant. Satan pushes back: “Take away his blessings,” Satan says, “and Job will curse you to your face” (1:11). And then something surprising happens: God allows Satan to test Job.

Disaster hits fast. Raiders steal Job’s oxen and donkeys. Fire falls from the sky and destroys his sheep and the servants watching them. More animals are lost. And then comes the worst news of all: a building collapses, and all of Job’s children die.

It’s hard to imagine such pain. Few people have faced that much loss in a single day. But here’s what’s most striking—Job does not curse God. Instead, he worships. He says, “The Lord gave, and the Lord has taken away; blessed be the name of the Lord” (1:21). Job loves God not for what he gets from Him, but for who God is.

> [!important]+ Reflect and Respond
Ask God today to help you love Him like Job did—not just when life is easy, and not just because He gives you good things. Ask Him to open your heart to see how beautiful Jesus is. And pray that knowing Him would be your greatest treasure, no matter what happens around you.
