# **July 03 -** **God Is Our Fortress**

Psalm 46 is a song about God’s power and love for His people. It was written by the sons of Korah, who led worship. The song says God keeps us safe, no matter what happens.

The psalm starts, “God is our refuge and strength, a very present help in trouble” (Psalm 46:1). This means God is like a strong castle. He protects us when we are scared. Even if the earth shakes or the sea roars, God is stronger (Psalm 46:2–3). We do not need to be afraid.

God also protects us when people fight or nations are angry. The psalm says, “The nations rage, the kingdoms totter” (Psalm 46:6). But God speaks, and the earth listens. He stops wars and brings peace (Psalm 46:9). God says, “Be still, and know that I am God” (Psalm 46:10). This means everyone must stop and see that God is in control.

God is our safe place. We can trust Him when life is hard. Jesus, God’s Son, died for us to bring us close to God. We should pray to trust God more and thank Him for being our fortress.

# **The Storm and the Castle**

Sam lives near a big forest. One day, a huge storm comes. The wind howls, and the trees shake. Sam is scared. He runs to his grandmother’s house. “Grandma, the storm is so loud!” he says.

Grandma smiles and opens her Bible. “Let’s read Psalm 46,” she says. “It says, ‘God is our refuge and strength’ (Psalm 46:1). God is like a strong castle. He keeps us safe, even in a storm.” Sam listens and feels a little better.

That night, Sam dreams he is in a big castle. Outside, the storm roars, and people shout. But inside, it is quiet and safe. A kind voice says, “Be still, and know that I am God” (Psalm 46:10). Sam knows it is God speaking. He feels calm.

The next day, the storm is gone. Sam tells Grandma, “God is stronger than the storm! He kept us safe.” Grandma nods. “Jesus, God’s Son, loves us. He helps us trust God.” Sam prays, “Thank You, God, for being my castle. I will trust You always.”
