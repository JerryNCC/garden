### <center>跟从耶稣的代价</center>

> [!info]- 🎙️Audio: [None]()

当Alex上大学时，他兴奋地加入了篮球队。他喜欢那些免费的队服，享受众人投来的目光，也因身为队员而感到身份不凡。可是，当训练真正开始时，现实却迎面而来：每天三个小时的操练，一遍又一遍的防守练习，浑身酸痛、筋疲力尽。他才明白，做队员并不是一个头衔，而是意味着辛劳、纪律与牺牲。

彼得的经历也很相似。起初，他似乎真的认识耶稣是谁。他勇敢地宣告：“你是基督，是永生神的儿子”（太16:16）。耶稣肯定了他的信心，并应许要借着彼得的信心与事奉建立教会。看起来，门徒们好像开始明白耶稣的身份了。但他们还没有真正理解祂的使命。

不久，耶稣开始说明祂将要在耶路撒冷受苦并被杀，第三日复活。祂直言不讳地讲到十字架和复活。那刚刚承认祂是基督的彼得，却无法接受这些话，甚至拉着耶稣责备祂。彼得所盼望的，是一位大有能力、得胜的基督，而不是一位要受苦的主。但耶稣清楚表明：十字架正是祂使命的核心。祂来是要借着受死与复活，为罪人成就救恩。

责备彼得之后，耶稣转向众门徒，发出郑重的呼召：跟随祂就意味着牺牲。“若有人要跟从我，就当舍己，背起他的十字架来跟从我。因为凡要救自己生命的，必丧掉生命；凡为我丧掉生命的，必得着生命”（太16:24–25）。弥赛亚的道路，并不是世人眼中的荣华，而是为神子民走向十字架的受苦之路。

> [!important]+ 反思与回应
所以呼召很清楚：耶稣已经为我们这些罪人舍己。跟随祂，就意味着舍弃骄傲、罪恶，甚至自己的性命，好得着祂直到永远。今日当求圣灵赐你一颗爱耶稣胜过一切的心，并赐下力量，使你天天为祂的名背起自己的十字架来跟随祂。

### <center>The Cost of Following Jesus</center>

> [!question]+ Review
> 1.⁠ ⁠In the parable of the sower, what do the four types of soil represent about the human heart?
2.⁠ ⁠Why did Jesus speak in parables instead of explaining things directly?
3.⁠ ⁠What characterizes a true believer who is like the “good soil”?

📖 **Passage to read**: ==Matthew 16==

> [!info]- 🎙️Audio: [None]()  


When Alex came to college, he was thrilled to join the basketball team. He loved the new gear, the recognition, and the sense of identity. But when practice began, reality hit. Three hours of drills every day. Muscles sore, energy drained. He realized being on the team wasn’t about the title—it was about hard work, discipline, and sacrifice.

Peter had a similar experience. At first, he seemed to grasp who Jesus was. He boldly confessed: “You are the Christ, the Son of the living God” (16:16). Jesus affirmed him, promising that through Peter’s faith and ministry, the church would grow. It looked as if the disciples were finally understanding Jesus’s identity. But they had not yet understood his purpose.

Soon after, Jesus began to explain his coming suffering and death in Jerusalem. He spoke plainly of the cross and resurrection. Peter, who had just confessed Jesus as the Christ, could not accept this. He rebuked Jesus for speaking of such things. Peter wanted a Christ of power and triumph, not one of suffering. But Jesus made clear that the cross lay at the very center of his mission. His purpose was to secure salvation through his death and resurrection.

After correcting Peter, Jesus turned to his disciples with a sobering call: following him would mean sacrifice. “If anyone would come after me, let him deny himself and take up his cross and follow me. For whoever would save his life will lose it, but whoever loses his life for my sake will find it” (16:24–25). The way of the Messiah was not glory by human standards. It was the path of suffering for the sake of God’s people.

> [!important]+ Reflect and Respond
So, the call is clear: Jesus gave himself for sinners like us. To follow him means giving up our pride, our sin, and even our own lives, to gain him forever. Pray that God’s Spirit will give you a heart to love Jesus above all and strength to carry your cross daily in his name.
