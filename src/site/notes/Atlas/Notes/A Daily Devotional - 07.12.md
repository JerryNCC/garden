### <center>敬畏耶和华</center>

> [!info]- 🎙️Audio: [A Daily Devotional - 07.12 - CN]()

我们常听见一些耳熟能详的俗语，比如：“三思而后行”、“早起的鸟儿有虫吃”、“你可以牵马到河边，却不能强迫它喝水”。这些话虽简短，却富有智慧。然而，圣经中的箴言却远不止于此。它们不仅是帮助我们度日的巧妙语句，更是神赐给祂子民的真智慧。《箴言》是圣经中“智慧文学”的一部分，写作目的是引导那些已经属于神的人，在神的群体中过敬虔的生活。这些箴言不是通往救恩的指引手册，也不是叫人靠行为赚取神喜悦的法则，而是给属神之人行事为人的智慧。

在《箴言》开篇，我们就读到一节可称为整卷书核心的经文，也是整个智慧文学的主题：“敬畏耶和华是知识的开端”（箴1:7）。这就是根基。如果一个人不敬畏神——也就是不尊崇祂，不敬拜祂，不以祂为可畏——那么这书中所有的智慧都无法真正帮助他。惟有敬畏神的人，才会渴慕听从祂的训诲，重视祂的真理，行在祂的道中。而那拒绝敬畏神的人，也必轻看祂的智慧与教训，最终自食愚妄之果。

在这章经文中，我们听见两种声音在呼唤我们。第一种是罪人的声音。他们试图诱惑我们偏离神的道路，追求放纵与自我中心的生活。他们说：“我们要埋伏流人之血，要无故蹲伏害无辜的人”（箴1:11），“我们必得各样宝物，将所掳来的装满房屋”（箴1:13）。这是对暴力和贪婪的邀请，听来刺激诱人，却终将走向灭亡。“这些人埋伏，是为自流己血；蹲伏，是为自害己命”（箴1:18）。也就是说，顺从罪恶、追求私欲，结局就是死亡。

但还有另一种声音——智慧的声音。智慧像一个人，在街上大声呼喊，向所有愿意聆听的人发出善言良训。她不躲藏，不低语，而是清晰地、公开地向人指出神的道路。她盼望有人愿意谦卑下来，聆听神的教导，按祂的道而行。那些愿意听从智慧的人，必“安然居住，得享安静，不怕灾祸”（箴1:33）。

> [!important]+ 反思与回应
今日，就求神赐你一颗乐于聆听的心。祈求祂帮助你分辨出正确的声音——祂的声音。求祂显明罪、贪婪与私欲的危险，使你远离诱惑，有能力拒绝罪恶。也求祂帮助你在言语、思想、行为上都跟随救主耶稣，忠心行走在祂的道中。

📖 **Passage to read**: ==Proverbs 01==

> [!info]- 🎙️Audio: [A Daily Devotional - 07.12 - EN]()  

We hear a lot of familiar sayings—short, punchy phrases that offer a bit of advice. Things like “Look before you leap” or “The early bird gets the worm.” These are common in everyday life. But the proverbs we find in the Bible are something more. They’re not just clever words to help us through the day. They’re God’s wisdom, meant for his people. The book of Proverbs is part of what we call wisdom literature, and it was written to guide those who already belong to God. These sayings aren’t here to tell us how to earn our way to God. Instead, they’re here to help us live well as his people.

Right at the start of Proverbs, we find a verse that sets the tone for the whole book—and really, for all biblical wisdom. Proverbs 1:7 says, “The fear of the Lord is the beginning of knowledge.” That’s the foundation. If we don’t fear God—if we don’t respect, worship, and stand in awe of him—then all the wise words in this book won’t help us. But when we do fear the Lord, we’re drawn to listen to him, to care about his truth, and to walk in his ways. People who reject God also turn away from his wisdom. They end up ignoring instruction and paying a heavy price for it.

In this chapter, we see two voices calling out to us. First, there’s the voice of sinners. They try to pull us off course—to follow after pleasure and self-centered living. They say things like, “Let’s ambush the innocent for no reason” (1:11) and “Let’s get rich—fill our houses with stolen goods” (1:13). It’s a call to violence and greed. It sounds exciting at first, but it ends in disaster. These people are setting traps that end up catching themselves. “They lie in wait for their own blood” (1:18). In other words, living for sin and selfishness leads to death.

But then there’s another voice—Wisdom. Wisdom is like a person, calling out in the streets, offering good instruction to anyone who will listen. She doesn’t whisper or hide. She speaks clearly. She wants people to hear God’s word and live. Those who stop to listen, who humble themselves and follow God’s way, will find safety and peace. They “will dwell secure” (1:33).

> [!important]+ Reflect and Respond
So today, pray for a heart that listens. Ask God to help you hear the right voice—his voice. Pray that he would show you how dangerous sin really is. Ask for strength to say no to greed, selfishness, and temptation. And ask for help to follow Jesus in everything—in what you say, what you think, and what you do.
