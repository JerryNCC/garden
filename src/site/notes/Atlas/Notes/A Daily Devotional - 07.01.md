### <center>你为何离弃我？</center>

> [!info]- 🎙️Audio: [A Daily Devotional - 07.01 - CN]()

“我的　神，我的　神！为什么离弃我？”（诗篇 22:1）大卫身处人生低谷。他疲惫不堪，心灵沉重。虽然他不断祷告，却得不到安息。四周的人嘲笑他，讥讽他对　神的信靠。他觉得自己仿佛被猛兽环绕，无处可逃。然而，即使在这黑暗之中，大卫仍紧抓着他心中所知的真理——　神是信实的。

“然而你是圣洁的，是用以色列的赞美为宝座的。”（22:3）大卫这样说。他提醒自己　神的属性，也想起　神自他出生以来就不离不弃。大卫没有否认苦难的真实，而是坦然向　神倾诉。他诚实地哭喊，但他没有就此止步。

诗篇的结尾，大卫满怀信心。他相信　神终必施行拯救。他为还未临到的拯救而颂赞　神。我们不知道大卫当时正经历怎样的困境，但我们知道他把自己带到　神面前，在祷告中寻求依靠。

像许多弥赛亚诗篇一样，这篇诗篇超越了大卫本人的经历。它的终极成就是在耶稣基督身上。当耶稣被钉十字架时，他引用了大卫的呼求。父　神转脸不顾，不是因为耶稣有罪，而是因为他担当了世人的罪。

耶稣受苦时，罗马兵丁在他十字架下拈阄分他的衣服，正应验了诗篇中的预言。他口渴、疲惫、孤独无助。但这不是故事的终点。正如诗篇22篇从哀痛转向赞美，耶稣的故事也从十字架走向空坟墓。他从死里复活，得胜而出。如今，来自万邦万民的人因着他的救恩而敬拜　神。

> [!important]+ 反思与回应
这篇诗篇让我们更贴近救主所承受的极大痛苦。当他向父神呼喊：“你为何离弃我？”时，他是在为我们承受离弃。他担当了　神的忿怒，承受了彻底属灵的痛苦，为要叫一切信他名的人不至被永远离弃。请花些时间，感恩耶稣的舍命。他被离弃，为使我们永不被离弃。

### <center>Why Have You Forsaken Me?</center>

> [!question]+ Review
> 1. ⁠How does David describe God speaking through creation in Psalm 19? What does this reveal to us about knowing God?
> 2. According to verses 7 to 11, how does David praise God’s Word? What qualities of God's Word are emphasized through these descriptions?
> 3. When David responds to God’s revelation, what kind of prayer does he offer? How does he express his awareness of sin and his need for salvation?

📖 **Passage to read**: ==Psalm 22==

> [!info]- 🎙️Audio: [A Daily Devotional - 07.01 - EN]()  


“My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?” (22:1). David is in a very low place. He’s worn out and overwhelmed. Though he prays, he finds no peace. People mock him. They laugh at his trust in God. He feels surrounded, as if wild animals are all around him. But even in the darkness, David keeps coming back to what he knows is true—God is faithful.

“Yet you are holy, enthroned on the praises of Israel” (22:3), David says. He reminds himself of who God is. He remembers that God has been with him since birth. He doesn’t deny the pain. He cries out with deep honesty. But he doesn’t stop there.

By the end of the psalm, David is full of confidence. He believes God will come through. He praises God for deliverance—even though he hasn’t yet seen it. We don’t know what trouble David was facing, but we know he turned to God in prayer and trust.

Like many other psalms, this one points beyond David’s own life. Psalm 22 finds its final meaning in Jesus Christ. When Jesus hung on the cross, he cried out with David’s words. God turned his face away—not because Jesus sinned, but because he was carrying the sin of the world.

As Jesus suffered, Roman soldiers stood around, casting lots for his clothes—just as the psalm describes. He was thirsty, exhausted, and alone. But that was not the end of the story. Just like Psalm 22 moves from pain to praise, Jesus’s story moves from the cross to the empty tomb. He rose again. And now people from every nation worship God because of what Jesus has done.

> [!important]+ Reflect and Respond
This psalm helps us feel something of the pain Jesus endured on our behalf. When he cried, “Why have you forsaken me?” it was for us. He took God’s wrath so we wouldn’t have to. Take time to thank Jesus. He was forsaken so that we never would be.
