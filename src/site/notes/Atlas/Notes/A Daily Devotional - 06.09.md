### <center>抵挡一切邪恶的行为</center>

> [!info]- 🎙️Audio: [A Daily Devotional - 06.09 - CN]()


事情看似顺利，但尼希米的工作还没有完成。在第十三章中，我们看到神的子民仍在挣扎，许多改变仍需实行。当尼希米揭露神子民中的罪恶行为时，给我们树立了一个应对罪恶的正面榜样——无论是在个人生活中，还是在教会中。

尼希米希望神的子民忠心地活在神的话语之下，因此他坚决反对一切违背神命令的行为。

* 当百姓听到神关于外邦人与以色列人同住的律法后，便按照律法将外邦人隔离开来。
* 祭司以利亚实竟然给了敌对神子民、反对重建城墙的多比雅一个圣殿内的特别房间，尼希米立即将多比雅和他的物品驱逐出去。
* 祭司们没有得到应有的供养，尼希米确保这件事得到纠正。
* 许多人不尊守安息日，他们工作、搬运货物、做买卖。尼希米在安息日前夜停止一切工作，帮助百姓专心预备安息日的安息和敬拜。
* 尼希米发现有些犹太儿童是父母中有一方是外邦人，无法讲犹太人的语言，也听不懂神的话语。他严厉反对这样的通婚，并让百姓立誓不再犯此事。

虽然尼希米书带给我们希望，描绘神子民被掳归回后恢复生命和敬拜，但结尾提醒我们，他们依然远未完全。神的子民依旧破碎。尼希米热切推行改革，清除罪恶，表明他们在圣洁和顺服的道路上还有许多功课要做。他们需要一位救主。

> [!important]+ 反思与回应
愿你的信心引领你对圣洁和顺服怀有热切而全心的委身。祈求神赐你一颗像他一样的心，跟随那位为释放你脱离罪恶权势而死去的救主。

### <center>Opposing Every Evil Practice</center>

> [!question]+ Review
> 1. ⁠Why do Nehemiah and Ezra emphasize God’s word as more important than rebuilding the walls and temple?
> 2. How did the people respond after hearing the law being read aloud? How did they react to God’s word?
> 3. What is the true foundation of security for God’s people? How should we live out this security today?

📖 **Passage to read**: ==Nehemiah 13==

> [!info]- 🎙️Audio: [A Daily Devotional - 06.09 - EN]()  

Things seem to be going well, but Nehemiah’s work is not finished yet. In chapter 13, we see that God’s people are still struggling. Many changes still need to happen. As Nehemiah uncovers sinful behavior among God’s people, we are shown a strong example of how to respond rightly to evil—in our lives and in the church.

Nehemiah wants God’s people to live faithfully under God’s word. So, he stands against every practice that goes against God’s commands.

* When the people hear God’s word about foreigners living among Israel, they separate those of foreign descent according to the law.
* The priest Eliashib has allowed Tobiah—an enemy who opposed the wall rebuilding—to use a special room in the temple. Nehemiah removes Tobiah and his belongings.
* The priests have not been cared for as the law requires. Nehemiah makes sure this is corrected.
* Many people are not honoring the Sabbath. They work, carry goods, and sell things. Nehemiah stops all work the night before the Sabbath to help the people prepare for a day of rest and worship.
* Nehemiah finds Jewish children with one non-Jewish parent who cannot speak the Jewish language. Because they can’t understand God’s word, he strongly opposes this intermarriage and makes the people promise not to repeat it.

Though Nehemiah is a hopeful book, showing God’s people returning to life and worship after exile, it ends by reminding us they are still far from perfect. God’s people remain broken. Nehemiah’s passion for reform and purifying sin shows there is still much work to be done for holiness and obedience. They need a Savior.

> [!important]+ Reflect and Respond
Pray that your faith in Jesus will lead you to a passionate, wholehearted commitment to holiness and obedience. Ask God to give you a heart like His as you follow the Savior who died to free you from sin’s power.
