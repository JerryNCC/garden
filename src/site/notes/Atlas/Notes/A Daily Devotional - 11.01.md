### <center>使你得以自由的律</center>

> [!info]- 🎙️Audio: [None]()


保罗常常面对误解与批评。有些人认为，他所传讲的恩典福音会让人放纵犯罪——既然神总是赦免，何不任意而为？但保罗的回应坚定而清晰：真正经历过神恩典的人，绝不会轻看罪。恩典不是犯罪的通行证，而是进入新生命的力量。

在《罗马书》第八章1至11节，保罗更深入地解释了这个真理：信徒究竟如何能“向罪死、向神活”？答案就在于圣灵的工作。

保罗指出，律法本身无法做到圣灵所能成就的事。律法并非恶物——它启示了神的圣洁，指引祂的子民当行的路，也显明人对怜悯与恩典的需要。然而，律法不能改变人心。它能告诉人什么是对的，却不能使人爱慕那正确的事。保罗所说的“律法因肉体软弱，有所不能行的”（罗8:3），正是这个意思。律法能揭露罪，却不能使人脱离罪的权势。

然而，圣灵能！律法无能为力的地方，圣灵赐下生命。保罗称之为“赐生命之灵的律”，在基督里，使我们脱离“罪与死的律”（罗8:2）。这律不再是写在石版上的文字，而是那位活着的神亲自住在我们心里。圣灵的同在触及我们罪性的根源，使我们得以真正顺服、活出公义。

若你属于基督，那么圣灵此刻就住在你里面。祂赐你力量，使你能够拒绝罪、顺从神。你不再受旧生命的捆绑——因为基督已经释放了你。

> [!important]+ 反思与回应
今天，请向神献上感恩。你的得救，不仅是因为你相信了一套真理，更因为你领受了神亲自内住的灵。求祂帮助你，靠着圣灵的大能，过一个向罪死、向神活的自由生命。

### <center>The Law That Sets You Free</center>

> [!question]+ Review
> 


📖 **Passage to read**: ==Romans 08.01-11==

> [!info]- 🎙️Audio: [None]()  


Paul often faced criticism from people who misunderstood his teaching. Some thought his message about grace meant that people could sin freely since God would always forgive. But Paul’s response was firm and clear: anyone who truly understands and experiences God’s grace in Jesus will never treat sin lightly. Grace is not a license to sin—it’s the power to live a new life.

In Romans 8:1–11, Paul explains more deeply how this happens. How can believers actually live as people who are dead to sin and alive to God? His answer is simple but profound: it’s through the work of the Holy Spirit.

Paul points out that the law could never do what the Spirit can. The law itself was good—it revealed God’s holiness, guided His people, and showed them their need for mercy. But the law couldn’t change the heart. It could tell people what was right, but it couldn’t make them love what was right. That’s what Paul means when he says, “God has done what the law, weakened by the flesh, could not do” (Romans 8:3). The law exposed sin, but it couldn’t free anyone from its power.

That’s where the Holy Spirit comes in. What the law could not accomplish, the Spirit does. Paul calls this “the law of the Spirit of life,” which sets us free in Christ from “the law of sin and death” (Romans 8:2). The Spirit is not a new set of written rules but the very presence of God living in us. Through Him, we gain the power to resist sin and to walk in obedience.

If you belong to Jesus Christ, the Holy Spirit lives in you right now. He gives you real strength to say no to sin and yes to God’s will. You are no longer bound to the old life—you have been set free.

> [!important]+ Reflect and Respond
Take a moment today to thank God that salvation is not just about believing certain truths but about receiving His Spirit within you. Ask Him to help you, by that same Spirit, to live in freedom and obedience today.
