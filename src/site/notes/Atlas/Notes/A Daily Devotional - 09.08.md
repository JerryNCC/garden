### <center>结实的听道</center>

> [!info]- 🎙️Audio: [None]()

对于我们这些信靠福音的人——承认耶稣是神的儿子，是罪人的救主——有时会困惑：为什么有人拒绝他？难道不是人人都该渴慕这好消息吗？在这段经文中，耶稣亲自为我们解答。他讲了一个比喻，说明人们对神的道会有不同的回应。

祂说有一个撒种的人出去撒种。种子落在四种地方：路旁、石头地、荆棘里、和好土上。落在路旁的，被飞鸟很快吃掉。落在石头地的，起初发芽，却因没有根，很快枯干。落在荆棘里的，被荆棘挤住，不能生长。惟有落在好土里的，生长茂盛，结出许多果子。

随后，耶稣告诉门徒，祂用比喻说话是有目的的。比喻使有些人得见真理，却使另一些人仍然不明白。这正应验了先知以赛亚的话：“你们听是要听见，却不明白；看是要看见，却不晓得。”由此我们明白一个真理：唯有神自己开人的心，使人能领受祂的道。

耶稣进一步解释比喻。四种土代表四类人。有的心像路旁，天国的信息从未进入他们心里。有的像石头地，喜欢福音的观念，却没有真实的根基。有的像荆棘地，渴望耶稣，却仍紧抓罪恶和世俗的私欲，致使真信心被挤住。惟有好土，才是真正的信徒，他们听见、明白，并结出果子，以生命见证福音在他们里面扎根生长。

不是每个人都会接受耶稣的道。但那些真正属祂的人，必会因所结的果子而被认出来。

> [!important]+ 反思与回应
所以让我们祷告：求神保守我们脱离罪恶、忧虑和疑惑——这些容易拦阻我们聆听的事。求祂帮助我们，活出一个不仅听见福音，更是真实拥抱福音、在基督里结实累累的生命。

📖 **Passage to read**: ==Matthew 13:01-23==

> [!info]- 🎙️Audio: [None]()  

For those of us who trust the gospel—that Jesus is the Son of God and the Savior of sinners—it can be puzzling to see others reject him. Why wouldn’t everyone want this good news? In this passage, Jesus helps us understand. He tells a story, a parable, to show why people respond differently to the word of God.

He speaks of a farmer who goes out to scatter seed. The seed falls in four places: on a hard path, on rocky ground, among thorns, and on good soil. On the path, the seed is eaten quickly by birds. On the rocky ground, the seed springs up at first but soon withers because it has no root. Among the thorns, the seed is choked out. But in the good soil, the seed grows strong, flourishes, and produces much fruit.

Jesus then tells his disciples that he speaks in parables for a reason. The parables reveal truth to some, but to others they remain hidden. This is just as Isaiah had foretold: people will hear but not understand, see but not perceive. From this we learn an important truth: it is God himself who opens hearts to receive his word.

Jesus goes on to explain the parable more fully. The soils represent people. Some are like the hard path; the message of the kingdom never even enters their hearts. Some are like rocky ground; they like the idea of the gospel, but it never takes deep root. Others are like thorny soil; they want Jesus, but they also cling to sin and worldly desires, which choke out real faith. But then there is the good soil: those who hear, understand, and bear fruit. They show by their lives that the gospel has truly taken hold.

Not everyone will receive the word of Jesus. But those who do, those who truly belong to him, will be known by the fruit they bear.

> [!important]+ Reflect and Respond
So let us pray. Ask God to guard us from sin, worry, and doubt—things that so easily keep us from listening well. Ask him to help us live as people who not only hear the gospel but truly embrace it and bear fruit in Christ.
