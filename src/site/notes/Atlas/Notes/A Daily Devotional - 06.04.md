以斯拉为神子民的罪深感悲痛。到了以斯拉记第十章开始时，我们看到以色列人也同样忧伤。一个名叫示迦尼的人代表众人，在以斯拉和神面前公开承认他们的罪：“我们与我们的神背约，娶了这地的外邦女子为妻”（10:2）。众人对自己的罪深感懊悔，这是一件好事，表明他们认识到罪的严重性和神的圣洁。但单单懊悔是不够的。以斯拉记第十章教导我们，真正的悔改不仅是感到难过，更是彻底转离罪恶。

示迦尼继续劝勉众人：“我们要与神立约，把这些妻子和他们的儿女都撇弃，照我主和那些敬畏神诫命之人的劝告，并且要照律法行事”（10:3）。在今天看来，这样的要求似乎极其严厉。毕竟，一些神的子民已经娶了外邦人，还生了孩子。要他们将妻子送走，听起来残酷甚至不公。然而，我们必须明白，在以色列历史的那个时刻，这正是真正悔改所必须付出的代价。

以斯拉记的结尾充满庄重。那些与外邦女子通婚的人被公开点名，站在众人面前受责备。甚至连一些祭司也犯了同样的罪，他们也悔改，愿意送走外邦妻子。那些名字清晰地记录在书中，留给历代读者明鉴。

以斯拉的故事充满盼望。被掳的苦难已经结束，神依然在他的子民中工作，为了他们的救恩和他荣耀的彰显。然而，神要求他们全心委身，绝不能容让罪恶在他们中间。他们不可妥协自己的身份，牺牲对神的敬拜和忠诚。因此，这本充满盼望的书，最终以神子民严肃而果断的悔改作结。

> [!important]+ 反思与回应
今天，请问你自己：尽管你称耶稣为救主，你还在罪中生活吗？你是否真正悔改——求他赦免你的罪，彻底转离罪恶，跟随他？现在就祷告，求神塑造你成为一个真正悔改、谦卑且全心委身基督的人。

📖 **Passage to read**: ==Ezra 10==

> [!info]- 🎙️Audio: [A Daily Devotional - 06.04 - EN]()  

Ezra deeply mourned the sin of God’s people. At the start of Ezra 10, we see that the people of Israel shared this sorrow. One man, Shecaniah, spoke on behalf of everyone. He openly admitted their sin before Ezra and God: “We have broken faith with our God and have married foreign women from the peoples of the land” (10:2). The people felt remorse for their sin, and this was a good sign. It showed they understood how serious sin is and how holy God is. But feeling sorry alone is not enough. Ezra 10 teaches us that true repentance is more than sorrow; it means turning away from sin completely.

Shecaniah continued, urging the people: “Let us make a covenant with our God to put away all these wives and their children, according to the counsel of my lord and of those who tremble at the commandment of our God, and let it be done according to the Law” (10:3). To us today, this might seem very harsh. Some of God’s people had married these foreigners and even had children. Asking them to send their wives away sounds cruel and wrong. But we must understand that in this moment of Israel’s history, this was what true repentance demanded from God’s people.

The book of Ezra ends on a serious note. Those who had married foreign wives were named publicly and brought before the people. Even some priests were guilty of this sin. They too repented and agreed to put away their foreign wives. Their names are recorded plainly for all to see, even for us today.

Ezra’s story is one of great hope. The exile had ended. God was still at work among His people for their salvation and His glory. Yet, He demanded their full devotion. No sin could be allowed among them. They must not give up their identity as God’s people by compromising their worship or themselves. So, this hopeful book closes with God’s people making a drastic, serious repentance.

> [!important]+ Reflect and Respond
Ask yourself today: Are you still living in sin, even though you call Jesus your Savior? Or have you truly repented—asked for His forgiveness and turned completely from your sin to follow Him? Pray now, and ask God to make you a person of true repentance, humility, and full commitment to Christ.
