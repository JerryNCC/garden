### <center>残暴的巴比伦人</center>

> [!info]- 🎙️Audio: [None]()

在以赛亚书的前面章节中，我们已经多次听见神向祂百姓发出审判的宣告。神本是忍耐的，但祂的子民却持续犯罪与悖逆。最终，神任凭巴比伦人掳掠他们，使他们被带往异地。然而，此时便引发了一个问题：那巴比伦人呢？他们岂不是也行了许多恶事？他们残忍、贪婪、凶暴。神既然使用他们作为惩戒的工具，是否就意味着他们可以免于审判？以赛亚书第47章给出了明白无误的答案：不是的。神虽然使用巴比伦成就祂的旨意，却并不因此放过他们。他们同样要面对神的审判。

这一章起首，神向巴比伦发出命令：“迦勒底的处女啊！下来坐在尘埃中；要坐在地上，没有宝座。”（47:1）这是羞辱的语言。曾经显赫一时、富有且自高自大的巴比伦，如今将被神降为尘土。不仅如此，他们还将遭受更大的羞辱：“你的下体必被露出，你的羞耻也必显露；我要报仇，并不宽容人。”（47:3）神对巴比伦的审判将是彻底的、严厉的、令人蒙羞的。

为什么呢？神自己说：“我向我的百姓发怒，辱没我的产业，将他们交在你手中；你毫不怜悯他们。”（47:6）是的，神确实使用巴比伦来管教祂的子民。但巴比伦却滥用手中的权柄，毫无怜悯，变本加厉地加害以色列。他们错以为神既然沉默，就代表他们可以为所欲为，安然无虞。其实，他们错得离谱。

这对我们今天而言，是一个严肃的警示。神并不容忍罪恶。即使祂暂时使用罪人或恶国成就祂的计划，那些人依然要为自己的行为向神交账。神的公义不偏待人，没有罪能逃过祂的审察。昔日如此，如今依然如此。

> [!important]+ 反思与回应
但福音就在这里显明。我们本来也该承受神公义的审判，就如同巴比伦一样。但神为我们预备了出路——那就是耶稣基督。祂担当了我们该受的刑罚，使我们可以因信得救。感谢神赐下这奇妙的恩典！愿我们天天更多倚靠主耶稣，祂是我们唯一的盼望。

### <center>Brutal Babylonians</center>

> [!question]+ Review
> 1. ⁠Why does God choose to carry out His plan of salvation through a "servant" rather than an army or powerful nation? What does this reveal about how God works?
> 2. How does Isaiah describe the character and mission of this servant? What does the phrase "a bruised reed he will not break" tell us about God's heart for the weak?
> 3. What does it mean that this servant is called “a covenant”? How does this foreshadow the role and work of Jesus Christ in our lives?

📖 **Passage to read**: ==Isaiah 47==

> [!info]- 🎙️Audio: [None]()  

Up to this point in Isaiah, we’ve heard a lot about God’s judgment on his own people. God had been patient, but their sin and rebellion kept going. Eventually, he allowed the Babylonians to capture them and take them into exile. But now the question comes up: What about the Babylonians? Didn’t they also do wrong? They were violent, greedy, and cruel. So will God just let them go free because he used them? Isaiah 47 gives us a clear answer: No. Just because God used Babylon as part of his plan doesn’t mean they get a pass. They will be judged too.

The chapter opens with God speaking to Babylon: *“Come down and sit in the dust, O virgin daughter of Babylon; sit on the ground without a throne”* (47:1). This is the language of shame and humiliation. Babylon had once been rich, powerful, and proud. But now, God says, they will be brought low. And not just low—exposed, disgraced, and judged: *“Your nakedness shall be uncovered, and your disgrace shall be seen. I will take vengeance, and I will spare no one”* (47:3). God will fully judge them. It will be harsh, and they will feel it deeply.

But why? God explains: *“I was angry with my people; I profaned my heritage; I gave them into your hand; you showed them no mercy”* (47:6). Yes, Babylon was the tool God used to discipline his people. But that didn’t mean the Babylonians had the right to treat them harshly. They had no mercy. They went too far. And just because God didn’t judge them immediately, they thought they were safe. They were wrong.

This is a serious warning for us. God does not ignore sin. Even when he uses sinful people or nations as part of his bigger plan, he still holds them responsible for their actions. No one is above his justice. No sin is hidden from him. That’s true then, and it’s true now.

> [!important]+ Reflect and Respond
But there is hope. God has made a way for us to escape the judgment we all deserve. That way is Jesus. He took God’s judgment in our place. Thank God for his mercy. Ask him to help you trust Jesus more each day. He is our only hope.
