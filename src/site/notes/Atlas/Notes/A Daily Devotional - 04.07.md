### <center>想要与众不同</center>

> [!info]- 🎙️Audio: [A Daily Devotional - 04.07 - CN]()

当撒母耳临终时，百姓看到他的儿子们即将接替他，承担起审判他们的责任。正因如此，再加上其他一些原因，百姓向撒母耳提出了一个令人震惊的请求：他们要一个王。

为什么这个请求如此震惊？因为直到那时，以色列一直与周围的其他民族不同，他们没有人类的国王。他们不需要王，因为神自己是他们的王，亲自统治他们。虽然撒母耳的儿子们因作恶而可能间接促使了这个请求，但百姓提出请求的真正原因非常明显：他们想要“像其他民族一样”（8:5）。即使撒母耳已经警告他们拥有一个王会带来什么后果，他们依然坚持说：“不！我们要有一个王，像其他民族一样，让我们的王审判我们，带我们出征，为我们打仗”（8:19–20）。从神的话语来看，这是对神的拒绝。神一直是他们征战的带领者，而且祂远远胜过任何人类的王！然而百姓却想要与所有人一样。

的确，神的律法曾允许以色列最终有王来治理。申命记17章为以色列的国王提供了治理的指引。尽管如此，神决定不惩罚以色列，而是答应他们的请求，并借此实现祂的旨意，这个请求依然是有罪的。这是一次拒绝的行为。百姓拒绝了神作为他们伟大王的统治，屈从于一种普遍的诱惑：想要与别人一样。

> [!important]+ 反思与回应
我自己也常常感受到这种诱惑，正如你也会感受到的那样。渴望融入群体——像他们一样说话，做他们做的事，容忍他们容忍的罪恶。今天请你祈祷，求神帮助你不要让这种冲动支配你的生活。求神帮助你让祂作为你唯一的王，走在祂的话语引导下。如果你因耶稣得救并被宽恕，那么记住，你是为祂而分别出来的！

### <center>Wanting to Be Like Everyone Else</center>

> [!question]+ Review
> 1. Why did God allow the Philistines to discover Dagon fallen and broken, and why did the Philistines keep suffering disasters? What spiritual lessons are being taught through these events?
> 2. Why did God not allow Israel to request a human king to follow the ways of the surrounding nations? What attitudes of the people are revealed in this request before God?
> 3. As God demonstrates His sovereignty and power, how can the people avoid forgetting Him in the successes and blessings of life? How can we maintain our focus on our relationship with God?

📖 **Passage to read**: ==1 Samuel 08==

> [!info]- 🎙️Audio: [A Daily Devotional - 04.07 - EN]()  

As Samuel approached the end of his life, the people saw that his sons were about to take over the responsibility of judging them. Because of this, and for other reasons we’ll discuss, the people made a surprising request to Samuel: they wanted a king.

Why was this such a surprising request? It’s because, up until that point, Israel had stood out from every other nation around them because they didn’t have a human king. They didn’t need one. God himself was their King, ruling over them personally. Now, while Samuel’s sons may have contributed to the request by being corrupt judges, the real reason behind the people’s demand was clear: they wanted to be “like all the nations” (8:5). Even after Samuel warned them about what having a king would mean, they insisted, saying, “No! But there shall be a king over us, that we also may be like all the nations, and that our king may judge us and go out before us and fight our battles” (8:19–20). God’s own words show that this was a rejection of Him. God had been the one fighting their battles all along, and He was far better than any human king could be! But the people wanted to be like everyone else. 

It’s true that God’s law had allowed for a king to eventually rule over Israel. The law in Deuteronomy 17 gives instructions for how a king should lead the people. And while God does decide not to punish Israel for asking for a king, instead granting their request and using it for His purposes, this request is still sinful. It was an act of rejection. The people were rejecting God as their great King and giving in to a common temptation: the desire to be like everyone else.

> [!important]+ Reflect and Respond
I still feel the pull of this temptation, as I’m sure you do. The desire to fit in—talk like everyone else, do what they do, tolerate sin the way they do. Pray today that God would help you not to let that impulse control your life. Ask Him to help you follow Him as your King above all else, with His word as your guide. If you have been saved and forgiven by Jesus, remember that you are set apart for Him!
