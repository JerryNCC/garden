### <center>从苦涩到祝福</center>

> [!info]- 🎙️Audio: [A Daily Devotional - 04.01 - CN]()

《路得记》第四章为这段美丽的爱情故事画上了圆满的句号。波阿斯再次挺身而出，履行他作为救赎者的责任，娶了路得。然而，在我们看到波阿斯处理这段婚姻的细节时，我们注意到一个重要的事实：他的行为不仅仅是正确的，还是充满牺牲精神的。波阿斯为娶路得为妻做了正确的事，但这并不是一件容易的事。他没有被自私或追求安逸所驱动，而是毫不犹豫地走上前，做出正确的选择，愿意为他人的益处做出牺牲。

拿俄米——曾经自称为“苦涩”的她——如今被周围的妇女称为“蒙福的”（4:14）。她成为了波阿斯和路得的孩子的乳母。终于，拿俄米重新找回了快乐，周围是亲人，心中充满了上帝的祝福。这段爱情故事本可以在这里结束，附上一句：“他们从此过上了幸福的生活。”

然而，《路得记》结尾有一个大转折——一个可能会让你感到惊讶的细节。波阿斯和路得的儿子俄备得，竟然成了大卫王的祖父。这不仅仅是对这些人个人的祝福。虽然上帝确实关心拿俄米和路得，将拿俄米从空虚和苦涩中带到充实和喜乐之中，但上帝正在做更大的事情。通过他们的生活，上帝正在为未来的王作准备，那个王将统治祂的子民。

上帝的信实不仅体现在我们生活中的细节上，还体现在祂如何将我们个人的故事融入祂为历史所织就的大计划之中。路得，一个来自摩押的女子，起初毫无地位，最终成为了上帝子民的一员，甚至成为了大卫王的曾祖母。上帝对路得是信实的，而通过她，祂也信实地照顾了祂的百姓，预备了一位王来帮助他们打破士师时代的罪恶循环。

> [!important]+ 反思与回应
当你跟随那位完美的王——耶稣基督时，记得你的故事是上帝伟大计划的一部分。你是这部宏大故事的一部分，而上帝希望你在其中扮演好自己的角色。祈求祂帮助你保持信实，按照祂的话语生活每一天，并能引导他人走向那位完美的王和救主。

### <center>From Bitter to Blessed</center>

> [!question]+ Review
> 1. ⁠Why does Ruth choose to express her intentions to Boaz in such a bold way? What is the significance of her actions today?
> 2. How does Boaz demonstrate his role as the "redeemer"? What actions does he take to fulfill this role?
> 3. How does Ruth's pursuit of Boaz reflect how we should pursue Jesus Christ? What insights do you gain from Ruth's pursuit?

📖 **Passage to read**: ==Ruth 04==

> [!info]- 🎙️Audio: [A Daily Devotional - 04.01 - EN]()  

Ruth 4 brings us to the beautiful conclusion of this love story. Boaz steps in once more to fulfill his role as redeemer for Ruth, and he marries her. But as we see Boaz work through the details of this marriage, we notice something important: his actions are not just the right ones, but the sacrificial ones. Boaz is doing the right thing by claiming Ruth as his wife, but it’s not the easy thing. He’s not motivated by selfishness or concern for his own comfort. Instead, he steps forward, does what’s right, and is willing to sacrifice for the good of others.

Naomi—who had once renamed herself “Bitter”—is now called “Blessed” by the women around her (4:14). She becomes the nurse of the child born to Boaz and Ruth. Finally, Naomi is happy again, surrounded by family, and filled with God’s blessings. The love story could have ended here with the words: “And they lived happily ever after.”

But there’s a big twist at the end of the book of Ruth—a detail that might have surprised you. Obed, the son of Boaz and Ruth, turns out to be the grandfather of King David. This is more than just a personal blessing for these individuals. While God certainly cared for Naomi and Ruth, bringing Naomi from emptiness and bitterness to fullness and joy, He was also working something much larger. Through their lives, God was preparing the way for a future king who would rule over His people.

God’s faithfulness is evident not only in the small details of our lives but also in the way He weaves our individual stories into His great plan for history. Ruth, a Moabite with no status, became a full member of God’s people. She even became the great-grandmother of King David. God was faithful to Ruth, and through her, He was faithful to His people, bringing forth a king to help break the cycle of sin during the time of the judges.

> [!important]+ Reflect and Respond
As you follow the perfect King, Jesus Christ, remember that your story is part of God’s bigger plan. You are part of the grand narrative, and God wants you to play your role. Pray that He will help you to be faithful, to live by His word each day, and to point others to the perfect King and Savior.
