**Verse 1**
Into Your hands  
I commit again With all I am, for You, Lord  
You hold my world  
In the palm of Your hand  
And I am Yours forever

**Chorus**
Jesus I believe in You  
Jesus I belong to You  
You're the reason that I live  
The reason that I sing  
With all I am

**Verse 2**
I'll walk with You  
Wherever You go  
Through tears and joy  
I'll trust in You  
And I will live  
In all of Your ways  
And Your promises, forever

**Chorus**
Jesus I believe in You  
Jesus I belong to You  
You're the reason that I live  
The reason that I sing

**Bridge**
I will worship  
I will worship You

I will worship  
I will worship You
