大卫做了可怕的事——实际上，他做了许多可怕的事。他贪恋另一个男人的妻子，犯下了通奸罪，精心策划掩盖一切，最终还杀害了那个无辜的男人，那个曾是他妻子的丈夫。对于大卫来说，这真是一串令人震惊的罪行。但时间过去了，看起来他似乎逃脱了惩罚。拔示巴怀孕了，给大卫生下了一个儿子。

此时，神差遣先知拿单去见大卫。拿单用一种巧妙的方式让大卫认识到自己罪的严重性。他给大卫讲了一个令人心碎的故事，讲述一个拥有许多羊群的富人，强行从一个贫穷人那里夺走了唯一的心爱的小羊，只为了自己吃一顿饭。大卫听后立刻愤怒不已，要求惩罚这个恶行的富人，并宣称他该被处死。可是拿单接下来的一句话，却令大卫大吃一惊：“你就是那人！”（12:7）。拿单用这个故事揭示了大卫所做的一切——滥用权力，夺取本不属于自己的东西，就像故事中的富人一样。

大卫对拿单责备的反应让人深受触动。尽管他做了如此可怕的事，他的心依然渴望归向神。大卫本可以立刻将拿单处死，或将他赶出宫殿，拒绝听从他的警告。毕竟，他是王，可以做任何他想做的事。然而，大卫并没有因此而自高自大或愤怒，他谦卑地承认道：“我得罪了耶和华”（12:13）。

大卫的行为必然会带来后果。拿单告诉他，拔示巴所生的儿子将会死去。这个消息令大卫心中充满了极大的悲痛，但他接受了神对他罪的管教。他明白，尽管自己犯了错，神依然施恩于他，赦免了他的罪。当这一章结束时，我们看到神开始恢复对大卫的恩宠。神赐给他击败亚扪人的胜利，并且拔示巴又为他生下了一个儿子。这个儿子名叫所罗门，他将在神的计划中扮演一个特殊的角色。

> [!important]+ 反思与回应
花些时间阅读《诗篇》51篇，并以此作为向神祷告的方式。思考大卫悔改的心，看看他是如何认真对待罪的。学习他渴望神的怜悯，并让这篇诗篇引导你在自己犯错时，悔改并重新归向神。

> [!question]+ Review
> 1. How did David's sin develop step by step in 2 Samuel 11? When did his actions begin to escalate?
> 2. ⁠Why did David’s plan to cover up his sin fail? How did Uriah’s actions affect David?
> 3. ⁠What can we learn from David's repentance in this story? How can we avoid falling into similar traps in our own lives?

📖 **Passage to read**: ==2 Samuel 12==

> [!info]- 🎙️Audio: [A Daily Devotional - 04.24 - EN]()  

David had done something horrible—actually, many horrible things. He had lusted after another man’s wife, committed adultery, schemed to cover it all up, and ultimately killed the innocent man whose wife he had taken. It’s a long list of sins for David. But time passed, and it seemed like he had gotten away with it. Bathsheba had become pregnant, and a son was born to David.

Then, God sent the prophet Nathan to David. Nathan had a clever way of showing David the seriousness of his sin. He told David a heartbreaking story about a rich man with many sheep who took a poor man’s pet lamb to prepare it for a meal. David, immediately filled with anger, demanded that the rich man be put to death. But Nathan’s next words were a shocking revelation: “You are the man!” (12:7). Nathan was making it clear that David had done the same thing—abusing his power and taking what wasn’t his, just like the rich man in the story.David’s response to Nathan’s rebuke is what sets him apart. Even though he had done something terrible, his heart still longed for God. David could have had Nathan killed or cast him out of the palace. After all, he was the king and had the authority to do whatever he wanted. But David didn’t act on his pride or anger. Instead, he humbly admitted, “I have sinned against the LORD” (12:13).

David’s actions would not go without consequences. Nathan told him that the son born to Bathsheba would die. This caused great sorrow in David’s heart, but he accepted God’s discipline. He realized that, despite his sin, God had shown him mercy and forgiven him. As the chapter closes, we see God begin to restore His favor on David. God gave him victory over the Ammonites, and another son was born to Bathsheba. This son, Solomon, would play a special role in God’s plan for His people.

> [!important]+ Reflect and Respond
Take time to read Psalm 51 and use it as a prayer to God. Consider David’s heartfelt repentance and how seriously he took his sin. Learn from his desire for God’s mercy, and let this psalm guide your own repentance when you fail to follow God fully.
