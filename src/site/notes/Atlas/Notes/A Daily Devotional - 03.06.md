### <center>耶稣，完美的先知</center>

> [!info]- 🎙️Audio: [A Daily Devotional - 03.06 - CN]()


我们已经谈论过摩西作为神的百姓的中保的角色。他在帮助百姓敬拜神方面发挥了重要作用，教导他们如何生活以及如何亲近神。尽管祭司的职分是从摩西的哥哥亚伦开始的，但摩西同样也担负起了祭司的角色。他充当了中保，站在神与百姓之间，替他们向神祈祷。

但摩西同样也是一位先知。先知是向百姓宣讲神话语的人，而这正是摩西为以色列百姓所做的。在这段简短的经文中，摩西提到了一位将来会来的先知，那是百姓应当永远期待的。摩西说：“耶和华你们的神要从你们中间，从你们的弟兄里，给你兴起一位先知像我，你们要听从他。”（18:15）。摩西提醒百姓，曾有一段时间，他们聚集在何烈山，恳求摩西代替他们接受神的话语，并将神的话带给他们，因为他们害怕直接听见神的声音，生怕会死。百姓需要一位先知！

然而，摩西所说的关于未来先知的话，不仅仅是指将来在以色列国王统治期间出现的先知。摩西所说的是一位特别的先知，这位先知将从百姓中间兴起，完全带有神的话语。随着时间的推移，犹太百姓逐渐明白，摩西所说的这位先知指的是某一位特定的人——这位先知就是完美实现这应许的那一位。事实上，在《约翰福音》中，人们多次问约翰施洗者是否是“那位先知”（约1:21, 25），而他回答说：“不是！”摩西所说的那位先知——那位先知，当然就是耶稣基督。使徒彼得在《使徒行传》3:22中也提到了这一点。摩西的应许最终指向的是许多年之后的一个人——那位为神的百姓带来完美话语的最终先知。他将完美地传达神的话语，因为他就是神——以人的形态显现的神。

> [!important]+ 反思与回应
耶稣在我们生命中是多重身份——我们的君王，我们的救主，我们的主，我们的朋友。但在这里，我们特别要注意耶稣作为最终的先知。正是摩西在这段经文中所指向的那位先知——他将神的完美话语带给百姓。花一点时间祷告，求神帮助你认真聆听耶稣，完美的先知。

### <center>Jesus, the Perfect Prophet</center>

> [!question]+ Review
> 1. What does Moses mean by “circumcising the heart” in Deuteronomy 10? Why is heart transformation more important than merely behavior modification?
> 2. ⁠Moses emphasizes the relationship between loving God and obeying His commands. How can we understand the connection between loving God and following His commands?
> 3. ⁠According to Deuteronomy 10:16, Moses calls for a change of heart. How does this apply to our faith life today? How can we seek to obey God from the heart?

📖 **Passage to read**: ==Deuteronomy 18:15-22==

> [!info]- 🎙️Audio: [A Daily Devotional - 03.06 - EN]()  



We’ve talked a lot about Moses as the mediator for God’s people. He plays a key role in helping them worship by showing them how to live and how to approach God. Even though the priestly line begins with Aaron, Moses also takes on a priestly role. He acts as a mediator, standing between the people and God, offering prayers on their behalf.

But Moses also serves as a prophet. A prophet is someone who speaks God’s word to the people, and that’s exactly what Moses did for Israel. In this short passage, Moses speaks about a prophet who would come in the future, one that the people should always expect to have. Moses says, “The LORD your God will raise up for you a prophet like me from among you, from your brothers—it is to him you shall listen” (18:15). Moses reminds the people of a time when they were gathered at Horeb, and they begged him to receive God’s word for them, because they were too afraid to hear God speak directly, thinking they might die. The people needed a prophet!

However, Moses’ words about a future prophet go beyond just the prophets who will speak to Israel during the reigns of the future kings. Moses is talking about a single prophet who would come from the people—a prophet who would completely have God’s words in his mouth. Over time, the Jewish people came to understand that Moses’ words were pointing to a specific person—the perfect fulfillment of this promise. In fact, in the Gospel of John, people ask John the Baptist several times if he is “the Prophet” (John 1:21, 25), and he responds, “No!” The prophet Moses spoke of—the Prophet—is, of course, Jesus Christ. The apostle Peter also makes this connection in Acts 3:22. Moses’ promise ultimately points us many years ahead to one man who would be the ultimate prophet for God’s people. He would speak God’s word perfectly, because he is God—God in human flesh.

> [!important]+ Reflect and Respond
Jesus is many things to us—our King, our Savior, our Lord, and our friend. But focus here on Jesus as the ultimate prophet. He is the one Moses was pointing to in this passage—the one who would bring God’s perfect word to his people. Take a moment to pray and ask God to help you listen carefully to Jesus, the perfect prophet.
