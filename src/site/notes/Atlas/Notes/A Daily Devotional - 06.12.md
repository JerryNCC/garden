### <center>奸恶哈曼的阴谋</center>

> [!info]- 🎙️Audio: [A Daily Devotional - 06.12 - CN]()

在圣经的故事中，总少不了反派。从起初，我们就看见有人公然敌挡上帝和祂的子民：伊甸园中的那条蛇质疑上帝的话，引诱亚当和夏娃陷入罪中；埃及王法老用残暴辖制以色列人，试图阻止他们敬拜独一的真神。上帝的作为在世上，总会遭遇敌对与拦阻。

如今，故事来到了波斯帝国。一位名叫哈曼的人被亚哈随鲁王擢升至高位，众人向他屈身叩拜，几乎如同敬拜一般。但有一人例外——末底改，一位犹太人。他敬畏真神，拒绝向人下拜，把当得的尊崇只归给神。当哈曼发现这一点，怒火中烧。骄傲与野心受了冒犯，他不只要报复末底改，还要灭绝波斯境内所有的犹太人。

于是，哈曼向王进言，声称这些散居各地的犹太人有着不同的律法与风俗，不遵王命，是潜在的威胁。他甚至承诺，若王准他行此屠杀之举，便献上巨款入王府库。亚哈随鲁王听信了他的言词，便下旨签署诏令，定下日子要施行大屠杀。那城中顿时陷入混乱，被掳的犹太人惊惶失措，前途一片黑暗。

从人的角度看来，这似乎是上帝子民的终结。但哈曼并不知道，有一位犹太女子正坐在王的旁边——以斯帖。她的出现并非偶然，乃是上帝亲自安置，悄然却满有目的。我们开始思索：她会如何回应？上帝将如何借着她保守祂所爱的百姓？尽管哈曼权势滔天，也终究敌不过那位掌管万有的真神。

上帝并没有撇弃祂的子民——那时如此，如今依然如此。

> [!important]+ 反思与回应
当你在生活中看见有人敌挡上帝的作为，或是你自己的信仰遭遇挑战时，求主赐你一双属灵的眼睛，看见祂那隐藏却大能的手。祷告求祂赐你信心，使你相信祂的旨意，也知道祂的恩典计划是包括你在其中的。哪怕你暂时看不见，祂仍在动工，从未止息。

### <center>Hateful Haman Hatches a Plan</center>

> [!question]+ Review
> 1. ⁠Why did Esther need to keep her Jewish identity a secret in the palace? What potential consequences could this secret bring?
> 2. Even though the word "God" isn't mentioned in the Book of Esther, how can we still see God's sovereign hand at work?
> 3. Was Esther becoming queen just a coincidence? How does this part of the story help us recognize God's hidden guidance in our own lives?

📖 **Passage to read**: ==Esther 03==

> [!info]- 🎙️Audio: [A Daily Devotional - 06.12 - EN]()  


There’s usually a villain. From the start of the Bible, we see people rise up against God and his people. The serpent in the garden questions God’s word and leads Adam and Eve into sin. Pharaoh holds Israel in cruel slavery and tries to stop them from worshiping their God. The truth is, God’s work in the world always faces opposition.

Now in Persia, there’s a man named Haman. He’s just been promoted by King Ahasuerus to a high position. People bow to him and honor him—almost like they’re worshiping. But one man doesn’t. Mordecai, a Jew, refuses to bow. He serves the true God and won’t give honor that belongs only to Him. When Haman sees this, he’s furious. His pride and ambition are wounded. So he decides to do more than punish Mordecai. He wants to wipe out all the Jews in Persia.

Haman goes to the king with a plan. He tells him that the Jews are scattered throughout the empire, living by their own laws and not obeying the king. They’re a threat, he says. Then he offers a large sum of money to the royal treasury if the king agrees to let him get rid of them. The king listens and agrees. He signs an official order. A day is set. The city falls into confusion. The Jewish people begin to fear for their lives.

It looks hopeless. One man’s pride now threatens to destroy all of God’s people. But there’s something Haman doesn’t know. A Jewish woman sits beside the king—Esther. She’s been placed there by God. Not by accident. Quietly, but with purpose. We begin to wonder: what will she do? How will God use her? Haman may be powerful, but he’s no match for the living God.

God isn’t done with His people. Not then, not now.

> [!important]+ Reflect and Respond
As you see resistance to God’s work in your own life or in the world, ask Him to help you see His hand in everything. Pray for trust. His plan includes you. And He’s always at work, even when we can’t see it.
