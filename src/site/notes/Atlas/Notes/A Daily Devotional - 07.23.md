### <center>亲密的界限</center>

> [!info]- 🎙️Audio: [A Daily Devotional - 07.23 - CN]()

在《雅歌》第七章中，我们看到性之爱——甚至我们的身体——并不是羞耻之物。在正确的设定中，性是上帝赐予人类的美好礼物。当夫妻在婚姻的盟约中私下享受彼此的亲密，这是蒙福的事。问题并不在于性本身，而在于人把它从上帝设立的圣洁界限中撕裂出来。对今日文化中性泛滥的现象，基督徒的回应不应是把“羞耻”贴在性上，而是将性带回原本该被大大欢庆、喜乐享受的地方——婚姻之中。

本章一开始，男子向他的妻子表达爱意。他毫无保留地赞美她。他从头到脚欣赏她的身体。虽然其中一些比喻对我们今天的人来说有些奇怪——比如将她的肚腹比作麦堆，将鼻子比作黎巴嫩的高塔——但在当时，这些都是诚挚的赞美。我们看到的是一个男人被自己的妻子深深吸引，在爱情与渴望中满怀欣赏地歌颂她的美丽。

接着，女子也说话了：“我是属我良人的，他也恋慕我。”（雅歌 7:10）这是一个女人对丈夫之爱满怀笃定的话语。她在丈夫专一的爱中得着完全的安全感——这份爱只属于她一个人。正因如此，她才毫无保留地将自己献给他，在亲密中毫不迟疑地回应他的爱情。

性是上帝所造的，原是要在婚姻的关系中被享受的。在那里，爱与信任并肩同行。这段经文为我们描绘出一幅美好的图画：一个男人专心爱他的妻子，一个女人在丈夫忠诚的爱中得享安全，甘心将身心交托。

> [!important]+ 反思与回应
也许你在过去某些性方面的选择中曾有失败，但现在你可以重新立志，走进上帝为人类爱情、浪漫、性与婚姻所设立的美好蓝图中。这种忠诚、完整、委身的婚姻之爱，也正是指向上帝对我们的大爱——那完全不动摇、永远信实的爱。祂邀请我们也将自己全然献给祂。求上帝帮助你委身于祂对婚姻的旨意，在祂赐下的爱中满有喜乐地生活。

📖 **Passage to read**: ==Songs of Solomon 07==

> [!info]- 🎙️Audio: [A Daily Devotional - 07.23 - EN]()  

In Song of Solomon 7, we see that sexual love—and even our bodies—are not something to be ashamed of. In the right setting, sex is a good gift from God. It’s meant to be enjoyed privately, within marriage, between a husband and wife who are committed to each other. The problem isn’t with sex itself. The problem is when sex is taken out of that safe and holy place God gave it. The answer for Christians isn’t to treat sex as something dirty. Instead, we should bring it back into the place where it belongs: marriage, where it can be enjoyed with joy and thankfulness.

This chapter starts with the man expressing his love for his wife. He’s not holding back—he adores her. He’s admiring her body from head to toe. Some of the ways he describes her might sound odd to us—he compares her stomach to a pile of wheat, and her nose to a tall tower. But in their time, these were real compliments! What we see is a man completely taken with his wife, praising her and enjoying her beauty with love and desire.

Then the woman speaks. She says, “I am my beloved’s and his desire is for me” (7:10). These are the words of a woman who knows, without a doubt, that her husband loves her. She feels secure in that love—secure enough to give herself to him fully and joyfully. She isn’t worried or unsure. She knows he only wants her, and she wants to respond to that love with her own.

Sex was created by God. It’s meant to be enjoyed in marriage, where love and trust go hand in hand. This passage gives us a clear picture: a man focused on loving his wife, and a woman who knows she’s loved and gives her heart and body in return. It’s a good picture of the kind of love God intended for marriage.

> [!important]+ Reflect and Respond
Maybe you haven’t lived this way in the past. But today, you can make a new start. You can choose to follow God’s plan for love, sex, and marriage now. This kind of love—faithful, full, and committed—is a reflection of how God loves us. He loves us completely and invites us to give ourselves fully to him. Ask God to help you follow his design for marriage and to live with joy in the love he gives.
