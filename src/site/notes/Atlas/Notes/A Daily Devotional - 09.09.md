### <center>神迹</center>

制定规律的人，有时也能超越规律。在《马太福音》14:13–33里，耶稣超越了自然的定律：祂把少量的饼变成成千上万人的食物，又在海面上行走。这两件事，按自然来看，都是人类绝不可能做到的。

起初，耶稣退到旷野，想要独自安静。但众人跟随祂。祂看见他们，就怜悯他们，医治他们的病人。到了傍晚，问题显露出来：这是荒凉之地，没有食物。耶稣却用五个饼、两条鱼，喂饱了五千男人，还不包括妇女和孩子。这是四卷福音书都记载的唯一神迹，显明耶稣是供应者。祂能满足祂子民的需要，甚至能从几乎没有的中间创造出丰盛。

之后，耶稣打发门徒先坐船过去，祂自己留下来祷告。夜里，船已经离岸很远，耶稣却向他们走去——是在海面上行走。这不是人类理性能够解释的。耶稣显明了只有神才有的权能，祂是全地的主宰，连水也顺服祂。祂呼召彼得来，彼得也踏出船，在水面上走了一段，但因害怕而下沉。耶稣立刻伸手拉住他，而祂自己仍稳稳地站立在波涛中。

这段记载以敬拜作为结束。门徒见证了两个大神迹：五饼二鱼和海上行走。他们该如何回应呢？“船上的人都拜祂，说：‘你真是神的儿子了’”（太14:33）。耶稣的身份清楚显明：祂是永生神的儿子，是创造的主。对祂唯一正确的回应，就是敬拜。

> [!important]+ 反思与回应
今天就祷告吧，求神使你的生命在各处都充满对耶稣基督的敬拜。祂是那位能增饼、能踏海而行的主，更是唯一能拯救我们的救主。

> 1.⁠ ⁠In the parable of the sower, what do the four types of soil represent about the human heart?
2.⁠ ⁠Why did Jesus speak in parables instead of explaining things directly?
3.⁠ ⁠What characterizes a true believer who is like the “good soil”?

📖 **Passage to read**: ==Matthew 14:13-33==

> [!info]- 🎙️Audio: [None]()  

People who make the rules can sometimes seem to go beyond them. In Matthew 14:13–33, Jesus goes beyond the very rules of nature. He multiplies a little bread into food for thousands, and he walks on the water. Both are things no human being could ever do.

Jesus first goes away to a quiet place, wanting to be alone. But the crowds follow him. He sees them, has compassion, and heals their sick. When evening comes, the problem is clear: they are in the middle of nowhere, and there is no food. With only five loaves of bread and two fish, Jesus provides more than enough for everyone. Over five thousand men, plus women and children, are fed. This is the only miracle told in all four Gospels. It shows us that Jesus is the provider. He gives what his people need, even creating abundance out of almost nothing.

After this, Jesus sends the disciples ahead in a boat. He stays behind to pray. Later, when the boat is far out on the sea, Jesus comes to them—walking on the water. This is not something that can be explained by human reason. Jesus shows power that belongs only to God, who rules over all creation. Even the water obeys him. He calls Peter to come to him. Peter steps out and walks too, until fear overtakes him. Jesus reaches out, pulls him up, and stands firm while the waves roar around them.

The story ends with worship. The disciples have now seen two great signs: the feeding of the crowds and the walking on the water. How can they respond? They fall before him and say, “Truly you are the Son of God” (14:33). Jesus’s identity is made clear. He is the Son of the living God, the Lord of creation. The right response is to worship him.

> [!important]+ Reflect and Respond
So pray today that your life would be filled with worship for Jesus Christ. He is the one who multiplies bread and walks on the sea. More than that, he is the one who alone can save us.
