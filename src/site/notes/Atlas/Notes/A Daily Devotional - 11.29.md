### <center>属灵操练</center>

> [!info]- 🎙️Audio: [None]()

当你想到你的教会时，你首先会想到什么？也许是唱诗——弟兄姐妹聚在一起敬拜赞美神。也许是讲道——你的教会每周都忠心地教导圣经。也许是团契——信徒们定期聚会，互相鼓励和扶持。所有这些都是好事。然而，在提多书第 2 章中，保罗心里有一个特别的画面：他把教会看作一个属灵操练的地方。

保罗先给年长的男人下了指引，然后转向年长的妇女，告诉她们该做什么：“要教导良善的事，使年轻的妇女爱丈夫、爱儿女，谨守节操，纯洁，操持家务，仁慈”（2:3–5）。接着，保罗对牧者提多讲述如何训练年轻人。保罗的意思很清楚：教会是神子民彼此操练、教导彼此如何活出福音信仰的地方。年长的男人训练年轻的男人，年长的妇女训练年轻的妇女。如果你的教会里有各个年龄层的信徒，这是极大的福气。你应当善用与成熟信徒的关系，从他们身上学习如何为耶稣而活。

在本章结尾，保罗提醒提多，敬虔生活的操练最终都来自神的恩典。这恩典在耶稣基督里显现，并教导我们远避罪恶，同时等候我们极大的盼望：“我们伟大神和救主耶稣基督显现的荣耀”（2:13）。教会应当成为信徒操练为基督而活的场所，这通过与成熟信徒的关系，以及真实经历神在耶稣里的救恩恩典来实现。

> [!important]+ 反思与回应
祷告求神帮助你看教会，不只是每周去打卡的地方。求神让你看见教会是属灵操练的场所。积极建立与年长、智慧、敬虔成熟的信徒的关系。并求神借着他的恩典训练你，使你直到耶稣再来，都能为他而活。

### <center>Spiritual Training</center>

> [!question]+ Review

📖 **Passage to read**: ==Titus 02==

> [!info]- 🎙️Audio: [None]()  

When you think about your church, what comes to mind? Maybe it’s singing—believers gathering to lift praises to God. Maybe it’s preaching—your church faithfully teaching the Bible each week. Maybe it’s fellowship—people meeting regularly for encouragement and support. All of these are good. But in Titus 2, Paul has a very specific picture in mind: he sees the church as a place of training.

Paul begins by giving instructions for older men. Then he turns to the older women, telling them what they are to do: “teach what is good, and so train the young women to love their husbands and children, to be self-controlled, pure, working at home, kind” (2:3–5). Then Paul speaks to Titus, the pastor, and instructs him on training young men. Paul’s point is clear: the church is meant to train God’s people to live out gospel faith. Older men train younger men, older women train younger women. If your church has members of all ages, this is a great blessing. Take advantage of relationships with older, more mature believers, and learn from them how to live for Jesus.

At the end of the chapter, Paul reminds Titus that all training in godly living ultimately comes from God’s grace. This grace has appeared in Jesus Christ and trains us to say no to sin as we wait for our great hope: “the appearing of the glory of our great God and Savior Jesus Christ” (2:13). The church is meant to be a place where believers are trained to live for Christ, through relationships with mature believers and through the experience of God’s saving grace.

> [!important]+ Reflect and Respond
Pray that God would help you see your church not as a place you attend once a week to check it off your list. Ask him to help you see the church as a place of spiritual training. Seek relationships with believers who are older, wiser, and more godly. Ask God, by his grace, to train you to live for him until Jesus returns.
