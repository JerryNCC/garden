**[Scene: Emily and Jack are sitting by the **river**, planning a weekend picnic.]**

**Emily**: Jack, have you ever had a **picnic** by the **river** before?

**Jack**: Not really, but it sounds fun! I love the idea of sitting on a blanket, surrounded by nature.

**Emily**: Me too! But last time, we forgot to bring enough food. Let’s not make the same mistake.

**Jack**: Agreed! We should also bring a bag for trash. We don’t want to leave any litter on the **land**.

**Emily**: Good point. By the way, should we bring some chairs, or are we just sitting on the blanket?

**Jack**: Just the blanket is fine. I’ll find a nice flat **rock** to lean my **back** against.

**Emily**: Sounds comfy! Oh, and don’t forget to wear comfy **pants**. Climbing over the **wood** or **rocks** near the river might not be easy.

**Jack**: Yeah, I’ll avoid my new jeans. They’d probably get dirty or torn.

**Emily**: Smart choice. Remember last time, when Mike’s jeans tore, and he had to stay **absent** from the group photo?

**Jack**: Oh, yeah! That was hilarious. But poor Mike. He kept trying to **fix** them with tape.

**Emily**: (laughs) That was so funny! Anyway, let’s meet at the **school** parking lot on Saturday morning and drive together.

**Jack**: Perfect! I’ll bring sandwiches, and you can bring drinks.

**Emily**: Deal! Let’s make it a picnic to remember.
