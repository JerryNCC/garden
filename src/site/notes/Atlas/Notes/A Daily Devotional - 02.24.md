### <center>神所拣选的领袖</center>

> [!info]- 🎙️Audio: [A Daily Devotional - 02.24 - CN]()

请稍作回想，摩西领导神的百姓的起点。当神呼召他时，摩西正是一个逃亡的犯人，因杀人而四处逃命。但是什么让摩西与众不同呢？唯一的原因就是神拣选了他。神与他同在，这就足够了。这一事实——神的同在与祝福——成为本章的核心。在《民数记》第十六章中，我们又看到了叛乱的发生。这一次，叛乱的是一群渴望更多权力、影响力和权威的人。

在这一章中，一群由250位有影响力的人组成的队伍反叛摩西和亚伦。他们中的一些人甚至是祭司，在会幕中事奉，带领百姓敬拜神（第9节）。然而，这对他们来说并不够。他们渴望像大祭司亚伦那样的权威，想要像摩西那样的领导地位。作为回应，神使地面裂开，将他们和他们的家人吞噬，作为对他们叛逆的审判。这一震撼的事件是对以色列百姓的警示——神通过这一显著的行为向他们表明，摩西和亚伦并非人所选择的领袖，而是神亲自拣选、委派的领袖，来带领祂的百姓。

当我们阅读这一充满激烈冲突的章节时，我们会注意到摩西和亚伦有一个显著的特点：他们不断地伏倒在地。而与此同时，可拉和他的追随者却高高在上，试图宣扬他们的权力和控制。那些因叛乱的朋友受到审判的百姓，对摩西和神愤怒地挥拳。然而，摩西和亚伦没有反击。他们一次又一次地在神面前谦卑地伏倒。他们因百姓的罪而哀悼，为他们的罪行感到悲伤。他们伏倒在地，恳求神对这些罪恶、顽固的百姓施行怜悯，尽管他们不配得到怜悯。神听了他们的祷告，并因摩西和亚伦的忠心，赦免了百姓。

> [!important]+ 反思与回应
你最后一次在神面前谦卑自己是什么时候？今天，抽出一点时间，亲自或象征性地伏倒在神面前。为你自己生活中的罪而哀悼，求神因耶稣在十字架上为罪所成就的工作，而施行怜悯，赦免你和他人的罪。正是这种谦卑的祷告姿态，神呼召我们——祂的百姓，去持守。

### <center>God’s Chosen Leaders</center>

> [!question]+ Review
> 1.⁠ ⁠Why did the people become fearful after hearing the spies' report and choose to rebel against God's chosen leader, Moses?
> 2.⁠ ⁠Why was Moses able to intercede on behalf of the people and ask God to forgive their sins?
> 3.⁠ ⁠How is Jesus’ role as a mediator different from Moses’, and how can we be encouraged and inspired by this?

📖 **Passage to read**: ==Numbers 16==

> [!info]- 🎙️Audio: [A Daily Devotional - 02.24 - EN]()  

Think for a moment about the beginning of Moses’s leadership. When God called him, Moses was a fugitive, running for his life after having killed a man. But what made Moses stand out from everyone else? It was simply that God chose him. God was with him, and that was enough. That reality—God’s presence and blessing—becomes the core of this chapter. In Numbers 16, we see another rebellion. This time, it’s a group of people who crave more power, influence, and authority.

In this chapter, a group of 250 influential men rises up against Moses and Aaron. Some of them are even priests, serving in the tabernacle and leading the people in worship (verse 9). But for these men, serving in these roles isn’t enough. They want the authority of Aaron, the high priest, and the leadership Moses holds. In response, God causes the ground to open up and swallow them and their families as a judgment on their rebellion. This dramatic event is a warning to the rest of the Israelites—a sign from God that Moses and Aaron were not just chosen by people, but were specifically appointed by God to lead His people.

As we read through this intense chapter, we notice something about Moses and Aaron: they repeatedly fall on their faces. Meanwhile, Korah and his followers puff themselves up, trying to assert power and control. The people, angered by the judgment of their rebellious friends, shake their fists at Moses and God. But Moses and Aaron do not retaliate. They fall down again and again, in humility before a holy God. They fall down because of the people’s sin, mourning over it. They fall on their faces to ask God for mercy on a sinful, stubborn people who don’t deserve it. And God hears their prayers. He forgives the people because of Moses and Aaron’s faithfulness.

> [!important]+ Reflect and Respond
When was the last time you humbled yourself before God, literally or figuratively? Take a moment today to do that. Fall on your face before God. Mourn over the sin in your life, and ask God for mercy, both for yourself and others. It’s in that posture of humility and prayer that God calls us to be.
