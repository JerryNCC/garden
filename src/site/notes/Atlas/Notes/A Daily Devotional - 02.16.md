### <center>记住安息日</center>

> [!info]- 🎙️Audio: [A Daily Devotional - 02.16 - CN]()

起初，神创造了世界。他在六天内创造了万物，第七天则休息了。这个休息日被称为安息日。神非常重视安息日，并命令祂的百姓也要遵守这一点。事实上，记住安息日并保持其圣洁是神赐给摩西的十诫之一。安息日是一个专门为敬拜神和休息而设立的日子。

在《利未记》25章1至22节中，我们发现神关于安息日的两个出乎意料的指令。这些指令不仅仅适用于百姓，还适用于土地以及整个神的百姓社区。在第1至7节中，神吩咐摩西每七年让土地休息一次，不再耕作、收割，也不谋取利润。这一年被称为安息年。接着，在第8至22节中，神设立了禧年。禧年每五十年一次，内容包括归还被夺走的财产，释放被奴役的人，及土地再一次休息。

乍看之下，这些命令似乎不符合经济常理。如果人们只考虑金钱和利润，一周七天都工作似乎才合乎逻辑。土地和社区的情况也是如此，这些安息日对专注于财务利益的人来说似乎不切实际。但神在通过这些命令教导祂的百姓一个重要的教训：神必须比任何东西都更重要。这就是为什么神命令祂的百姓每周停止工作，休息并花时间敬拜祂。这也是为什么神要求祂的百姓每七年让土地休息，提醒他们所有的食物和财富最终都来自于祂。

> [!important]+ 反思与回应
今天我们从《利未记》中所能学到的教训是明确的：我们必须记住，神比任何事物都更重要——无论是人、财物还是工作。今天花些时间感谢神赐给你的一切，因为这一切都来自祂。求神帮助你在生活中为祂的恩典和良善腾出空间，让祂在你生活中居首位。

### <center>Remember the Sabbath</center>

> [!question]+ Review
> 1.⁠ ⁠How does God call His people to reflect holiness in their daily lives according to Leviticus?
> 2.⁠ ⁠How do the prohibited behaviors (such as prostitution, adultery, eating meat with blood, etc.) reflect God's expectations for His people's lives? What lessons can we learn from these prohibitions for our lives today?
> 3.⁠ ⁠How should God's holiness influence our actions and choices in our relationships with others?

📖 **Passage to read**: ==Leviticus 25:01-22==

> [!info]- 🎙️Audio: [A Daily Devotional - 02.16 - EN]()  

In the beginning, God created the world. He made everything in six days, and on the seventh day, He rested. This day of rest became known as the Sabbath. God cares deeply about the Sabbath, and He commands His people to do the same. In fact, remembering the Sabbath and keeping it holy is one of the Ten Commandments God gave to Moses. The Sabbath is a day set aside for worship and rest.

In Leviticus 25:1–22, we find two surprising instructions from God regarding the Sabbath. It’s not just for the people, but also for the land and the entire community of God’s people. In verses 1–7, God tells Moses to take a break every seven years from farming, harvesting, and making a profit from the land. This is called the Sabbath year. Then, in verses 8–22, God introduces the Year of Jubilee. This year happens every fifty years and includes returning property that has been taken, giving freedom to slaves, and another rest for the land.

 At first glance, these commands may not seem to make economic sense. If the people were only thinking about money and profits, working seven days a week would seem logical. The same goes for the land and the community. These Sabbaths might seem impractical to someone focused on financial gain. But God is teaching His people an important lesson: He must be more important to them than anything else. This is why God commands His people to stop their work once a week—to rest and spend time worshiping Him. This is also why God tells His people to let the land rest every seven years, reminding them that all food and wealth ultimately come from Him.

> [!important]+ Reflect and Respond
The lesson we can take from Leviticus today is clear: we must remember that God is more important than anything—whether it’s a person, possession, or job. Take some time today to thank God for everything you have because it all comes from Him. Ask God to help you make space in your life to remember His grace and goodness, so that He is exalted first in your life.
