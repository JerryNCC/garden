### <center>独一的英雄</center>

> [!info]- 🎙️Audio: [None]()

我们如今来到《马太福音》的最后场景。神的儿子正一步步走向十字架，要为神的子民成就救恩。在这条通往十字架的路上，我们看见许多人，也看见他们对耶稣的不同反应。

首先是那些宗教领袖——祭司长和公会。他们用虚假的指控陷害耶稣，并无情地讥笑他。接着是彼得，这位曾发誓无论如何都要跟随耶稣的门徒，却在最黑暗的时刻三次否认主，转身离开。然后是犹大，那位为了金钱出卖耶稣的人。他的结局极其悲惨，被内疚与绝望吞噬，最终自尽。还有群众，他们在狂热中选择释放一个凶手，却弃绝耶稣。我们也看见罗马巡抚彼拉多，他胆怯地洗手，想要推卸责任。最后是那些兵丁，在把耶稣带去钉十字架之前，无情地戏弄、鞭打他。人物虽然各不相同，但若细细观察，他们的心其实一样——他们都弃绝了耶稣。

重点在这里：这故事中只有一位真正的英雄，就是耶稣。即使被众人拒绝，甚至被自己的门徒离弃，他仍坚定地走向十字架。他知道自己将为他们的罪而死。马太向我们清楚地显明，自人类起初以来，人们一直做的就是拒绝那位创造并爱他们的上帝。整本圣经所讲的也是同一件事：只有一位真正的英雄——就是上帝自己。他是公义的，又是无限恩典与慈爱的上帝。即使必须差遣自己的独生子独自站立，独自走向十字架，他也绝不停止成就拯救罪人的计划。

> [!important]+ 反思与回应
这就是福音的奇妙。耶稣被众人撇下，仍然继续前行。他为那些讥笑他、吐唾沫的人舍命。全心感谢耶稣吧！记念当你还是罪人的时候，他就为你而死，替你偿还那你永远无法偿还的罪债。

### <center>Only One Hero</center>

> [!question]+ Review
> 1.⁠ ⁠What events did Jesus predict to his disciples after entering Jerusalem?
2.⁠ ⁠How did the disciples respond when Jesus was arrested?
3.⁠ ⁠How does this passage show Jesus’s love and salvation for sinners and his disciples?

📖 **Passage to read**: ==Matthew 26:57-27:31==

> [!info]- 🎙️Audio: [None]()  

We are now in the final scenes of Matthew’s Gospel. The Son of God is moving toward the cross to bring salvation to God’s people. Along the way, we meet many different people and watch how they respond to Jesus.

First, there are the religious leaders—the chief priests and the council. They accuse Jesus with lies and mock him without mercy. Then comes Peter, the disciple who once promised to stay with Jesus no matter what. Yet Peter denies him three times, turning his back in the darkest hour. Next is Judas, the one who betrayed Jesus for money. His story ends in despair as he takes his own life, crushed by guilt. Then there is the crowd. In their frenzy they choose a murderer to go free instead of Jesus. We also see Pilate, the Roman governor, who cowardly washes his hands, trying to avoid responsibility. Finally, the soldiers mock and beat Jesus before leading him away to be crucified. So many different faces—but if you look closely, their hearts are the same. Every person in the story rejects Jesus.

Here is the point. There is only one hero here, and it is Jesus. Though rejected by all, even by his own disciples, he keeps walking toward the cross. He knows he will die for their sins too. Matthew gives us a clear picture of what people have done since the beginning of time: turning away from the God who made and loves them. The Bible tells this same story. There is only one true hero—God himself. He is perfectly just and endlessly gracious. He will not stop his plan to save sinners, even if it means sending his only Son to stand alone and die alone on the cross.

> [!important]+ Reflect and Respond
This is the wonder of the gospel. Jesus, abandoned by all, still goes forward. He dies for the very people who mocked him and spat on him. Give thanks to Jesus with all your heart. Remember that while you were still a sinner, he died for you and paid the debt you could never pay.
