### <center>尼布甲尼撒王与西底家王</center>

> [!info]- 🎙️Audio: [A Daily Devotional - 05.28 - CN]()

在犹大中，或许曾有一些人认为这样的日子永远不会到来，尽管神通过祂的先知多次警告他们。神真的会让祂的子民被从祂所应许的土地中带走吗？祂会允许圣殿——那个专为祂敬拜而设立的地方——被摧毁吗？《列王纪下》24至25章给出了痛苦而明确的答案：是的，神，圣洁的以色列神，确实如此看待罪恶，并且祂会追究祂子民的责任。

当《列王纪下》25章开始时，巴比伦王尼布甲尼撒已经击败了犹大，并将成千上万的人掳掠到巴比伦。他只留下了土地上最贫穷的百姓，并任命了一个名叫西底家的王来统治他们。西底家是尼布甲尼撒在之前的王耶何亚斤被掳到巴比伦之后任命的。尽管神通过掳掠来审判犹大，西底家仍然选择在神眼中行恶。更糟的是，他决定反叛巴比伦王，导致了巴比伦的再次入侵。

这一次，不仅仅是一次战斗；尼布甲尼撒的军队围困了耶路撒冷，导致了可怕的饥荒，百姓开始忍受饥饿。最终，他们抓住了西底家，杀死了他的儿子，挖出他的眼睛，并将他作为囚犯带到巴比伦。接着，发生了令人难以置信的事情：巴比伦人摧毁了神的圣殿——以色列人敬拜神的中心。他们还抢走了圣殿中的所有财富，将其带到了巴比伦。当他们抵达巴比伦后，尼布甲尼撒命令将一些犹大的领袖，包括两位祭司，处死。神的子民的失败与掳掠终于完成。

多年来，神一直警告祂的子民这一天的到来。然而，尽管有如此多的警告，百姓和他们的王仍然继续拜偶像，而不是敬拜唯一的真神。他们一再选择罪恶与自私，而不是顺服神的话语。掳掠提醒我们，神确实憎恶罪恶，而罪恶必然带来审判与死亡。但即便如此，这也不是故事的结束！

> [!important]+ 反思与回应
今天，花些时间向神认罪。反思你是否在生活中设立了偶像，而不是单单敬拜祂。思考你在罪与自私方面的倾向，问问自己是否完全顺服神的话语。最重要的是，感谢神，感谢祂的儿子耶稣基督在十字架上为你的罪与背叛付上了全部的代价。

### <center>King Nebuchadnezzar & King Zedekiah</center>

> [!question]+ Review
> 1. ⁠Why was King Josiah deeply moved when he discovered the Book of the Law? What does this reaction teach us about our own spiritual lives today?
> 2. Even though Josiah's reforms couldn't change God's judgment on Judah, God still promised that no disaster would come during his reign. What does this promise mean for our faith life today?
> 3. Did Josiah truly demonstrate trust in God? When we encounter God's Word, can we, like Josiah, respond immediately in faith and take action?

📖 **Passage to read**: ==2 Kings 25:01-21==

> [!info]- 🎙️Audio: [A Daily Devotional - 05.28 - EN]()  

There were some people in Judah who probably thought that day would never come, even though God had warned them repeatedly through His prophets. Would God really let His people be taken from the land He promised them? Would He allow the temple, the place dedicated for His worship, to be destroyed? Second Kings 24-25 answers these questions with a painful, clear yes. God, the holy God of Israel, is serious about sin, and He holds His people accountable.

By the time we get to 2 Kings 25, King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon has already defeated Judah and taken thousands of people into exile. He left only the poorest of the land behind and placed a king named Zedekiah over them. Zedekiah had been appointed by Nebuchadnezzar after Jehoiachin, the previous king, was taken to Babylon. Despite God’s judgment on Judah through exile, Zedekiah still chose to do evil in God’s sight. Even worse, he decided to rebel against Nebuchadnezzar, leading to another Babylonian invasion.

This time, it wasn’t just a battle; Nebuchadnezzar’s army besieged Jerusalem, causing a terrible famine as the people began to starve. Eventually, they captured Zedekiah, killed his sons, gouged out his eyes, and took him as a prisoner to Babylon. Then, the unthinkable happened: the Babylonians destroyed the temple of God—the very center of worship for the Israelites. They also looted all the treasures of the temple and carried them off to Babylon. Once they arrived there, Nebuchadnezzar had several leaders of Judah, including two priests, executed. The defeat of God’s people and their exile was now complete.

For years, God had warned His people about this very thing. Yet, despite His warnings, the people and their kings continued to worship idols instead of the one true God. They kept choosing sin and selfishness instead of obedience to God’s Word. The exile serves as a sobering reminder that God hates sin, and that sin brings judgment and death. But even this is not the end of the story!

> [!important]+ Reflect and Respond
Take a moment today to confess your sins to God. Reflect on the ways you may set up idols in your life instead of worshiping Him alone. Consider your own tendencies toward sin and selfishness, and ask yourself if you are fully obeying His Word. Most importantly, thank God for Jesus Christ, who paid the full penalty for your sin and rebellion on the cross.
