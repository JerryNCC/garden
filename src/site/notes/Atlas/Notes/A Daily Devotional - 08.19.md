### <center>狮子、火窑与祷告——哦！</center>

> [!info]- 🎙️Audio: [None]()

当我们翻开《但以理书》，发现故事的背景仍然是在被掳之中。但这卷书的焦点却集中在一个人身上——先知但以理。他的经历提醒我们，被掳并不意味着神弃绝了祂的子民。绝非如此！这一章让我们看见三件重要的事。

第一，要记得这些事件发生在极大痛苦与艰难之时。有时我们太熟悉《但以理书》的故事——狮子坑、火窑——以至于觉得它们像是孩子们的故事，却忘了其中真实的恐惧与危险。这些并不是娱乐的传说，而是真实的生死关头，是神显明祂拯救大能的时刻。虽然本章的结尾带来盼望，但别忘了，但以理和他的朋友们依然是被掳之民，身在巴比伦，远离故土，被军队掳走，与家人分离。

第二，要注意但以理和他的朋友们紧紧持守作为神子民的身份。他们的选择绝非容易之事。在巴比伦的训练中，他们必须学习异邦的文化，承受极大的同化压力。然而，但以理立定心志：“不以王的膳和王所饮的酒玷污自己”（1:8）。换句话说，他们宁可坚守对神的忠心，也不愿因妥协而失去自己属神的身份。

第三，要看见神的手伸到了巴比伦。被掳并没有使神远离祂的子民，也没有阻挡祂的眷顾。相反，神赐下超乎想象的恩典，连巴比伦王都因他们而蒙福。但以理和他的朋友们比全国所有的术士和谋士更有智慧，以至于王开始倚靠他们。神显明自己不仅是以色列地的神，更是全地的主宰。

> [!important]+ 反思与回应
祷告吧，求神使你因爱耶稣而立定心志，专心跟随祂。求祂帮助你拥抱作为祂儿女的身份，使你在面对压力、试探和仇敌攻击时，仍能坚定站立。

> [!question]+ Review
> 1.⁠ ⁠In Ezekiel’s vision, what does the resurrection of the dry bones symbolize about the spiritual condition of Israel?
2.⁠ ⁠God promises to “put my Spirit within you.” What kind of deeper renewal and restoration does this point to?
3.⁠ ⁠How does Jesus in John 3 respond to this vision, and what does it teach us about the meaning of being “born again”?

📖 **Passage to read**: ==Daniel 01==

> [!info]- 🎙️Audio: [None]()  

When we open the book of Daniel, we find ourselves still in the time of exile. But here the focus narrows down to one man, the prophet Daniel. His story reminds us that exile does not mean God has abandoned his people. Far from it! This chapter gives us three things to see.

First, remember that these events happen during a time of great pain and trouble. Sometimes the stories of Daniel—the lions’ den or the fiery furnace—sound so familiar and almost like children’s tales, that we forget how real the fear and danger were. These were not just stories for entertainment. They were moments of life and death, and moments when God showed his power to save. Even though this chapter ends on a hopeful note, Daniel and his friends were still exiles in Babylon, far from home, taken by force from their families and land.

Second, notice how Daniel and his friends refuse to give up their identity as God’s people. The choice they made was not an easy one. They were being trained in the ways of Babylon, learning its culture, and facing heavy pressure to conform. But Daniel made up his mind: “He would not defile himself with the king’s food or with the wine he drank” (1:8). In other words, he and his friends chose to remain faithful to God, even when compromise would have been easier.

Third, see how God’s hand reaches even into Babylon. Exile did not put God out of reach, nor did it stop him from caring for his people. More than that, God blessed them in such a way that even the king of Babylon noticed. Daniel and his friends were found wiser than all the king’s magicians and advisors, so much so that the king began to rely on them. God showed that he is not just the God of Israel’s land, but the God who rules everywhere.

> [!important]+ Reflect and Respond
Pray that your love for Jesus will move you to follow him with resolve. Ask God to help you embrace your identity as his child, so that you can stand firm when you face pressure, temptation, or the attacks of the enemy.
