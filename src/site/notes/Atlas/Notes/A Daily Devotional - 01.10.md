### <center>骄傲的合一</center>

> [!info]- 🎙️Audio: [A Daily Devotional - 01.10 - CN]() N/A

回想一下你曾经做错的事情。也许你对父母撒了谎，或者有些事情你从未向神坦白。当你回想起那段罪行时，试着理解背后是什么驱动了你。我相信，归根结底，这一切都可以归结为一个东西：骄傲。事实上，骄傲是每一切罪的根源。它是我们自然的欲望，让自己掌控一切，成为我们生命中的神。

我们可以在这个故事中清楚地看到这种骄傲。在故事的开头，我们看到那时的人们讲着相同的语言，住得很近。这是文明的开端。每天，他们都在做新的发现。这对他们来说一定是一个激动人心的时期！但是，随着时间的推移，那份激动逐渐变成了骄傲。当他们看到自己的能力和成就时，他们开始对在神的统治下生活感到不满足。他们想要像神一样。我们可以从他们的话语中听到这种想法，他们计划建造那座塔时说：“来吧，我们建造一座城和一座塔，塔顶通天，我们为自己取个名字”（创世记11:4）。

然而，讽刺的是：神必须降临，来看这座本应通天的塔。不要误以为神担心人类会击败祂！神看到了真正的危险：人类联合起来，不是为了荣耀祂的创造者，而是为了庆祝他们自己的骄傲。他们并不会摧毁神，但他们会摧毁自己。因此，神对他们进行了审判。祂让他们四散，把不同的语言赐给他们，使他们无法彼此理解。

今天，花点时间审视你自己的内心。你是否有试图让自己成为生命中的神？花些时间向神认罪你的骄傲，求祂帮助你在生活中渴望祂的名被高举，愿意跟随祂的儿子耶稣基督。


> [!important]+ 反思与回应
> 神是圣洁的，祂必定会审判罪恶。今天，向神认罪，承认你生活中违背祂旨意的行为和思想。记住，虽然神的审判必然，但祂已通过耶稣基督的牺牲显明恩典，让你脱离审判，得享永生的盼望。

Think about a time when you did something wrong. Maybe you lied to your parents, or maybe there's something you've never confessed, even to God. As you think about that moment, ask yourself what was behind it. My guess is that it was probably pride. In some way, pride is at the root of every sin; it’s our desire to make ourselves the god of our lives.

We can clearly see this human impulse in the story. At the beginning of this chapter, we read that everyone spoke the same language and lived close together. This was the dawn of civilization, and people were making new discoveries every day. It must have been an exciting time for humanity! But somewhere along the way, that excitement turned into pride. People looked at their abilities and capacities, and instead of being thankful to God, their Creator, they became dissatisfied. They wanted to be God. You can hear their pride in their words as they plan to build their great tower: “Let us build ourselves a city and a tower with its top in the heavens, and let us make a name for ourselves” (11:4).

In a twist of irony, God has to come down to see the tower that was supposed to reach the heavens. But don’t misunderstand; God isn’t worried that humanity will rise up and overpower Him! Instead, He sees the danger in a humanity that is united, not in praise of its Creator, but in its own pride and accomplishments. The people wouldn't destroy God; they would destroy themselves. So God judges them for their pride and their ridiculous attempt to reach the heavens by their own strength. He scatters them and gives them different languages so they can no longer understand one another.

> [!important]+ Reflect and Respond
> Take a good look at your heart today. Are there ways you try to make yourself the god of your life? Spend some time confessing your pride to God. Ask Him to help you desire His name to be great in and through your life as you follow His Son, Jesus Christ.
