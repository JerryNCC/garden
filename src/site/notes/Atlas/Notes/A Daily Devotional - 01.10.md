回想一下你曾经做错的事情。也许你对父母撒了谎，或者有些事情你从未向神坦白。当你回想起那段罪行时，试着理解背后是什么驱动了你。我相信，归根结底，这一切都可以归结为一个东西：骄傲。事实上，骄傲是每一切罪的根源。它是我们自然的欲望，让自己掌控一切，成为我们生命中的神。

我们可以在这个故事中清楚地看到这种骄傲。在故事的开头，我们看到那时的人们讲着相同的语言，住得很近。这是文明的开端。每天，他们都在做新的发现。这对他们来说一定是一个激动人心的时期！但是，随着时间的推移，那份激动逐渐变成了骄傲。当他们看到自己的能力和成就时，他们开始对在神的统治下生活感到不满足。他们想要像神一样。我们可以从他们的话语中听到这种想法，他们计划建造那座塔时说：“来吧，我们建造一座城和一座塔，塔顶通天，我们为自己取个名字”（创世记11:4）。

然而，讽刺的是：神必须降临，来看这座本应通天的塔。不要误以为神担心人类会击败祂！神看到了真正的危险：人类联合起来，不是为了荣耀祂的创造者，而是为了庆祝他们自己的骄傲。他们并不会摧毁神，但他们会摧毁自己。因此，神对他们进行了审判。祂让他们四散，把不同的语言赐给他们，使他们无法彼此理解。

今天，花点时间审视你自己的内心。你是否有试图让自己成为生命中的神？花些时间向神认罪你的骄傲，求祂帮助你在生活中渴望祂的名被高举，愿意跟随祂的儿子耶稣基督。


> [!important]+ 反思与回应
> 神是圣洁的，祂必定会审判罪恶。今天，向神认罪，承认你生活中违背祂旨意的行为和思想。记住，虽然神的审判必然，但祂已通过耶稣基督的牺牲显明恩典，让你脱离审判，得享永生的盼望。

> [!question]+ Review
>1. What promises are included in the covenant between God and Noah? Why did God choose to give Noah a sign—the rainbow?
 >2. Why did God decide not to destroy the earth with a flood again, even though He knew Noah's descendants would continue to sin?
>3. From the covenant between God and Noah, what can we learn about God's character, especially His grace and faithfulness?

📖 **Passage to read**: ==Genesis 11==

> [!info]- 🎙️Audio: [A Daily Devotional - 01.10 - EN]()


The great flood sent by God has finally ended, and the waters have subsided. This moment marks a new beginning for humanity. God starts over with Noah and his family, giving them the same command he once gave to Adam and Eve: “Be fruitful and multiply and fill the earth” (Genesis 9:1). Imagine how grateful Noah and his family must have been! They were the only ones spared from God’s judgment. Surely, they were ready and excited to begin this fresh chapter of humanity, right?

But let’s take a step back. God had just brought judgment on nearly the entire human race because of their sin. While Noah was righteous, what about his family? What about their future descendants? What assurance is there that humanity won’t fall into sin again, prompting another worldwide judgment? If I were one of Noah’s sons, I might feel anxious, wondering what the future held.

Throughout the Bible, one truth comes through again and again: God is gracious and merciful. We see this clearly in the covenant he makes with Noah and his family. God promises that he will never again destroy the earth with a flood. He repeats this promise several times and even gives a sign to confirm it—a rainbow in the sky. This beautiful symbol serves as a reminder of God’s commitment to this promise.

Does God know that Noah’s descendants will sin and rebel against him? Yes, he does. But in his mercy, God chooses not to bring destruction again through a flood. Instead, he allows humanity to continue. One day, sin will be dealt with permanently, and God will judge the earth. But for now, he shows his patience and grace, keeping his promises even though we don’t deserve them.

Take a moment to marvel at this God who keeps his word to sinful people. The life we have today is a gift of his grace. Thank him for your life and remember that he is a God who makes and keeps promises to the undeserving. If you belong to Jesus, he has made a promise to you as well—a promise to forgive, accept, guide, and keep you until the day you see him face to face.


> [!important]+ Reflect and Respond
>God is holy, and His righteousness demands judgment on sin. Today, take time to confess your sins to God, acknowledging the ways you have gone against His will. Remember, while judgment is certain, He has shown great grace through the sacrifice of Jesus, rescuing you from judgment and giving you the hope of eternal life.
