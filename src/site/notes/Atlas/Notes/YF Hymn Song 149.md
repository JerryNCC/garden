VERSE 1

What love could remember no wrongs we have done  
Omniscient, all-knowing, he counts not their sum  
Thrown into a sea without bottom or shore  
Our sins they are many, his mercy is more  
临我众罪人的爱何等奇妙；  
全知全能神不再算我罪过；  
将我众罪投入无边的深渊；  
我们罪虽众多，祂怜悯更多。

VERSE 2

What patience would wait as we constantly roam  
What father so tender is calling us home  
He welcomes the weakest, the vilest, the poor  
Our sins they are many, his mercy is more  
我们如羊走迷，主何等忍耐；  
呼唤我回家声，慈祥又紧迫；  
祂拥抱软弱污秽贫穷的人；  
我们罪虽众多，祂怜悯更多。

VERSE 3

What riches of kindness he lavished on us  
His blood was the payment his life was the cost  
We stood (be)’neath a debt we could never afford  
Our sins they are many, his mercy more  
从高天降下恩慈何等长阔；  
主为我流血，舍命赎我罪过；  
我永难偿还，因这罪债沉重；  
我们罪虽众多，祂怜悯更多。

CHORUS

Praise the Lord, his mercy is more  
Stronger than darkness, new every morn  
Our sins they are many, his mercy is more  
赞美主，祂怜悯更多！  
胜黑暗权势，晨恩新做；  
我们罪虽众多，祂怜悯更多！
