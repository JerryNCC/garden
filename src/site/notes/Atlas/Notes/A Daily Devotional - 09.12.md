### <center>王来了——却是要被杀</center>

> [!info]- 🎙️Audio: [None]()

当耶稣进入耶路撒冷时，那并不是一次普通的进城。他骑着门徒牵来的驴驹，群众兴奋地聚集迎接他。有人把衣服铺在路上，有人砍下树枝挥舞着，高喊“和散那归于大卫的子孙！”（太21:9）。这些举动象征着胜利与盼望。人们以为这就是他们等待已久的王，那位大卫的后裔，来治理神的百姓。虽然他们并未真正明白耶稣要带来怎样的国度，也不完全错了。他们迎接的，确实是神所差来的真王。

马太接着记载，耶稣进城后的第一件事，就是去到圣殿——那是神子民敬拜、祷告与献祭的中心。但他所见到的，并不是敬拜，而是买卖。商贩与兑换银钱的人充斥在殿院，趁着远道而来的朝圣者需要献祭的牲畜，大肆牟利。耶稣严厉斥责他们说：“经上记着说：‘我的殿必称为祷告的殿’，你们倒使它成为贼窝了！”（太21:13）。他的行动比言语更为激烈：推翻桌子，把他们赶出殿去。这并不是人们印象中那位温柔的耶稣。在这里，他显明了自己作为君王的权柄，不仅掌管耶路撒冷，更掌管神的圣殿。

那么，这位君王的统治是否已经开始？也许一些门徒这样想。但马太让我们看见，事情的发展另有深意。祭司长和文士们见到百姓都归向耶稣，就心生愤怒。耶稣的确是那位满有权柄的王，马太在这里让我们一窥祂的威荣。但祂却不是世人所期待的那样的王。祂进入耶路撒冷，不是要登上宝座，而是要走上十字架。

> [!important]+ 反思与回应
今日，请你向这位大君王祷告。记念祂是谁，并感谢祂——这位先为子民舍命、如今又永远掌权的王。

### <center>The King Has Come—to Be Killed</center>

> [!question]+ Review
> 1.⁠ ⁠Which three disciples did Jesus take with Him up the mountain during the Transfiguration?
2.⁠ ⁠Which two Old Testament prophets appeared with Jesus in His glory?
3.⁠ ⁠What did the voice from the cloud declare?

📖 **Passage to read**: ==Matthew 21:01-17==

> [!info]- 🎙️Audio: [None]()  

When Jesus entered Jerusalem, it was not a normal entrance. He rode on a young donkey that his disciples had brought to him, and crowds gathered with excitement. People spread their cloaks on the road, cut branches from the trees, and waved them as symbols of victory and hope. They shouted, “Hosanna to the Son of David” (21:9). To them, this was the long-awaited King, the descendant of David who had come to rule over God’s people. They were not fully right about the kind of kingdom Jesus was bringing, but they were not completely wrong either. They were welcoming the true King, sent by God, into his city.

The first thing Matthew tells us about after Jesus enters Jerusalem is his visit to the temple. This was the most important place for worship, prayer, and sacrifice. But what Jesus saw there was not worship—it was business. Merchants and money changers had filled the temple courts, using the needs of travelers to make a profit. Jesus responded with sharp words: “ ‘My house shall be called a house of prayer,’ but you make it a den of robbers” (21:13). And his actions matched his words: he overturned tables and drove out the sellers. This is not the quiet and soft picture of Jesus many imagine. Here, Jesus shows his authority as the King, not only over Jerusalem but even over God’s temple.

But has the King begun his reign? Some of the disciples may have thought so. Yet Matthew gives us a hint of what is ahead. The chief priests and scribes saw the people gathering around Jesus, and they became angry. Jesus was the King with all authority, and Matthew shows us a glimpse of that here. But he would not be a king like the world expected. He came into Jerusalem in triumph—not to be crowned, but to be killed.

> [!important]+ Reflect and Respond
Take time to pray to your King. Remember who Jesus is. Give thanks that he is the King who first laid down his life for his people, and who now reigns over them forever.
