### <center>我如何知道自己已经得救？</center>

> [!info]- 🎙️Audio: [None]()


一位年轻人坐在青年牧师的办公室里，双手抱着头。牧师认识他已经很久了；这名年轻人是教会青年事工中的骨干人物，在教会里的服事、在学校中的福音见证与领导力，都让牧师感到欣慰与期待。然而，这一天他前来，是因为自己正在为一个严肃的问题挣扎——他对自己的得救产生了深深的疑惑。“我怎么才能**确定**，我是真的得救了呢？”他抬起头，眼神中满是诚恳与不安。

你是否也有过这样的时刻？你是否也曾问过自己：我真的永远属于耶稣吗？若真有一份清楚的“检查清单”，一步步对照，确认无误，那该多好啊！不过，使徒约翰并没有给我们一张清单，但他确实帮助我们把这个问题浓缩为**两个重要的记号**，用来分辨一个真正的基督徒。

**第一，真正的基督徒对其他信耶稣的人怀有真实的爱。**  
这是约翰书信中一再出现的主题，在《约翰一书》3:11–24 中更是核心信息之一。约翰指出，彼此相爱的命令是“从起初就有的”（3:11）。换句话说，这一直都是神子民的标志。约翰也进一步清楚说明，这爱究竟是什么样的爱——是像耶稣那样的爱，“他为我们舍了命”（3:16）。这正是我们认识何为爱的方式！这是一种为着其他信徒而甘愿付出、甚至牺牲自己的爱。今天，这样的爱是否正在塑造你的生命与内心呢？

**第二，真正的基督徒承认耶稣基督是神的儿子，并且道成肉身，成为真正的人。**  
这一真理在约翰书信的其他部分有更深入的论述，而在本段经文中，约翰再次简要提及，并将其与彼此相爱并列，作为真正基督徒的两大标志：“神的命令就是叫我们信他儿子耶稣基督的名，并照他所赐给我们的命令彼此相爱”（3:23）。真正的基督徒，既爱神的子民，也信靠耶稣基督——那位道成肉身的神子。

> [!important]+ 反思与回应
那么，这些真正基督徒的记号，今天是否能在你的生命中看见呢？我盼望是的！我盼望你在教会并不完美的现实中，仍然越来越爱神的百姓；我也盼望你在任何处境中，都勇敢地承认耶稣的神性与人性——他是神的儿子。愿你祷告，求神使这些特质在你跟随耶稣的道路上，越来越清楚、越来越坚定地显明出来。

### <center>How Do I Know That I Am Saved?</center>

> [!question]+ Review
> 

📖 **Passage to read**: ==1 John 03.11-24==

> [!info]- 🎙️Audio: [None]()  

A young man sat in his youth pastor’s office, head in his hands. The pastor had known him for a long time; the young man was a prominent part of the youth ministry at church, and the pastor was excited about his life, leadership at church, and gospel ministry at school. Yet the young man had asked to meet because he was struggling with serious doubts about his salvation. “How do I know, for sure, that I am really saved?” he asked, sincere concern in his eyes.

Have you been there? Have you wondered how you can know if you truly belong to Jesus forever? Wouldn’t it be nice if there were a checklist that you could work through to make sure? Well, the apostle John doesn’t give us a checklist, but he does help us boil this question down to two important marks of a true Christian.

First, a true Christian has genuine love for other believers in Jesus. That’s a repeated theme in John’s letter, and it is a major theme in 1 John 3:11–24. John says that the simple command to love one another is one that has been there “from the beginning” (3:11). In other words, this has always been a marker of God’s true people! John even clarifies, helpfully, what kind of love we are to have for other Christians. It’s love like that of Jesus, who “laid down his life for us” (3:16). That is how we know what love is! It’s radically sacrificial love for other believers in Jesus. Does that characterize your life and heart today?

Second, a true Christian affirms that Jesus Christ is God’s Son, come in the flesh as a human being. This is a concept that has shown up more strongly in other parts of John’s letter, but he mentions it again briefly in this passage, as he summarizes the two marks of a real Christian: “This is his commandment, that we believe in the name of his Son Jesus Christ and love one another, just as he has commanded us” (3:23). Real Christians love God’s people, and they believe in Jesus Christ as God’s Son in the flesh.

> [!important]+ Reflect and Respond
_Are those marks of a true Christian evident in your life today? I hope they are! I hope that you find yourself loving God’s people more and more, despite the many imperfections of the church today. I hope that you boldly affirm—in every situation—the divinity and humanity of Jesus, God’s Son. Pray that these characteristics would mark you strongly as you follow Jesus!_
