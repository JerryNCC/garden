### <center>〈使徒行传的结尾〉</center>

> [!info]- 🎙️Audio: [None]()


在《使徒行传》的开头，耶稣从死里复活。升天之前，祂给门徒留下了一个应许：圣灵要降临在他们身上，他们要为祂作见证，直到地极。那时的他们，并不是一群令人印象深刻的人——不过百余人，聚集在耶路撒冷的一间屋子里，安静地等候主的应许成就。

然而，到了《使徒行传》二十八章，一切都不同了。福音像烈火般蔓延开来，迅速扩展、生根，藉着彼得、司提反、巴拿巴、西拉，尤其是保罗的忠心宣讲，遍传各地。与此同时，我们也看到，凡传福音的事工都不会没有反对。如今，我们看见保罗身戴锁链。

当保罗抵达罗马时，他的处境还算良好。他虽被看守，却得以独自居住，也很快与当地信主的弟兄姊妹相见。接下来发生的事并不令人意外——保罗照常开始传福音。他邀请在罗马的犹太领袖们前来探访，从早到晚向他们讲论耶稣，“见证神国的道，并用摩西的律法和先知的话劝他们信耶稣”（徒28:23）。

然而，这并不是保罗事奉的终点。他在罗马住了整整两年，凡到他那里来的人，他都热情接待，无论是犹太人还是外邦人。他“放胆传讲神国的道，将主耶稣基督的事教导人，并没有人禁止”（徒28:30–31）。保罗虽然身陷囹圄，但他的生命仍满有使命与盼望。上帝甚至使用他的囚禁，使福音得以在帝国的心脏——罗马城中广传。

这，就是《使徒行传》的结尾。但其实，这并不是终结，而是起点。整卷书讲述的，是上帝的福音——那关乎耶稣基督的好消息——如何爆发、扩散、扎根于古代世界。随着福音的传播，许多地方建立了教会。而我们即将读到的新约书信，正是那些使徒写给初期教会的信，教导他们如何在基督里忠心生活。

> [!important]+ 反思与回应
当你思想这些事时，请记得福音是怎样开始的：一群胆怯的信徒，在耶路撒冷的楼房中祷告等候。然而，藉着圣灵的大能，信徒从百余人成长为数千人。愿这真理坚固你的信心——那同一位圣灵，今日仍在工作。也愿这真理挑战你——像保罗一样，勇敢作主的见证，在你所在之处传扬耶稣基督。求神使你的信心更加坚定，使你的生命成为那位救主的活见证，因祂仍在改变世界。

### <center>The End of Acts</center>

> [!question]+ Review

📖 **Passage to read**: ==使徒行传 28:11-31==

> [!info]- 🎙️Audio: [None]()  

At the start of the book of Acts, Jesus had just risen from the dead. Before returning to heaven, he gave his disciples a promise: the Holy Spirit would come, and they would be his witnesses to the ends of the earth. It didn’t seem like a strong beginning. Only about one hundred and twenty believers gathered in a small room in Jerusalem, waiting quietly for what Jesus had promised.

Now, by the time we reach Acts 28, everything has changed. The gospel has spread like fire. It has grown, multiplied, and taken deep root through the preaching of Peter, Stephen, Barnabas, Silas, and especially Paul. Yet this growth has not been without hardship. Every step of gospel progress met with opposition—and now, we find Paul in chains.

When Paul finally arrives in Rome, his situation could have been much worse. He’s under guard, but he’s allowed to live by himself. Soon he meets other believers, and before long, he begins to do what he always does—he shares the gospel. He invites the Jewish leaders in Rome to visit him. From morning to evening, he talks with them about Jesus, “testifying to the kingdom of God and trying to convince them about Jesus from the Law of Moses and the Prophets” (Acts 28:23).

But Paul’s work doesn’t stop there. He stays in Rome for two full years, welcoming anyone who comes to see him—Jews, Gentiles, anyone willing to listen. He keeps “proclaiming the kingdom of God and teaching about the Lord Jesus Christ with all boldness and without hindrance” (Acts 28:30–31). Even in prison, Paul’s life is full of gospel purpose. God is using his confinement to spread the good news in the very heart of the Roman Empire.

And that’s how Acts ends. It’s not really the end of the story, though. Acts tells us how the gospel of Jesus—the message of salvation—spread across the ancient world. Churches sprang up everywhere. The letters we’ll read next in the New Testament were written to these very communities of believers, guiding them to live faithfully for Christ.

> [!important]+ Reflect and Respond
As you reflect on this, remember where it all began: a small, frightened group of followers in Jerusalem. Yet through the power of the Holy Spirit, the gospel reached thousands. Let that encourage you. The same Spirit is at work today. And may it also challenge you—to be a bold witness for Jesus, wherever God has placed you. Pray that your faith in Christ grows deeper, and that your life becomes a clear testimony to the Savior who still changes the world.
