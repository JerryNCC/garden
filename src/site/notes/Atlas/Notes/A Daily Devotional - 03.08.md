### <center>悔改</center>

> [!info]- 🎙️Audio: [A Daily Devotional - 03.08 - CN]()

神呼召基督徒活出圣洁与顺服的生活，但祂也知道我们会时常跌倒。这就是为什么神为罪人提供了完美的代求者——祂自己的儿子。虽然神要求祂的百姓顺服，但为了救赎我们所需的完美顺服，最终只能由完美的神亲自提供。所以，作为神的百姓，我们不仅被呼召要活出圣洁与顺服，也被呼召在犯错时怀着谦卑的心悔改，承认我们远远未能达到祂完美律法的标准。

这正是《申命记》30章的信息核心。神预料到祂的百姓会经历不顺服、叛逆与顽固，这些都不会让祂感到惊讶。第一节预示着，因着他们的不顺服，神的百姓将因惩罚被流放到外邦。然而，神并不会抛弃他们。祂会管教他们，但祂也会继续邀请他们悔改，呼召他们无论身处何地都可以回到祂面前。当祂的百姓怀着谦卑的心悔改，并信靠神，神必定垂听。这是多么美好的应许，来自一位充满恩典的神！摩西在第三节中描述了神对这种悔改的回应：“耶和华你们的神必恢复你们的境况，怜悯你们，把你们从耶和华你们的神所分散的万民中聚集回来。”

但这段经文中还有更深的含义。神的悔改邀请不仅仅是让祂的百姓回转，祂还应许要改变他们的心。祂要为他们施行心的割礼，使他们的爱完全归向祂。这是神要解决根本问题——心的问题。我们以前曾听过“心的割礼”这一说法，但在这里，神应许祂亲自来完成这项工作！祂将改变祂百姓的心，使他们渴望祂所渴望的，爱祂所爱的。

> [!important]+ 反思与回应
你是否拥有一颗新心？你是否在日渐爱神，并从内而外不断被改变，变得更加像祂？今天，请花些时间祷告，感谢神对你无尽的恩典，并求祂继续改变你的心，使你能够更加顺服祂。

### <center>Repentance</center>

> [!question]+ Review
> 1. ⁠Why does God emphasize that His people must “carefully obey all His commandments” in Deuteronomy 28? What is the relationship between obedience to God's commandments and receiving His blessings?
> 2. ⁠How do you understand that God’s law for His people is both a pathway to blessing and a warning? How can this understanding help us properly view God's commandments?
> 3. ⁠When facing temptations or difficulties in life, how can you rely on God's word to stay obedient? What specific actions can you take to live under the authority of God's word?

📖 **Passage to read**: ==Deuteronomy 30:01-10==

> [!info]- 🎙️Audio: [A Daily Devotional - 03.08 - EN]()  

God calls Christians to live holy and obedient lives, but He also knows that they will fall short at times. That’s why God has provided the perfect advocate for sinful people: His own Son. While God demands obedience from His people, the perfect obedience needed for salvation can only be fully provided by the perfect God Himself. So, as God’s people, we are called not only to holiness and obedience, but also to humble repentance whenever we fall short of His perfect law.

This is the heart of the message in Deuteronomy 30. God expects His people to struggle with disobedience, rebellion, and stubbornness. These things don’t surprise Him. Verse 1 looks ahead to a time when, because of their disobedience, God’s people will be exiled to foreign nations as a consequence. But God will not abandon them. He will discipline them, but He will also continue to invite them to return to Him, no matter where they are. When His people repent with humble hearts and turn to Him in faith, God will listen. What an amazing promise from such a gracious God! Moses describes God’s response to this repentance in verse 3: “The LORD your God will restore your fortunes and have mercy on you, and He will gather you again from all the peoples where the LORD your God has scattered you.”

 But there’s even more in this passage. God’s invitation to repentance isn’t just about bringing His people back; He promises to change their hearts. He will circumcise their hearts, so that their love will be fully for Him. This is a promise to address the root of the problem—the heart problem. We’ve seen the idea of the circumcision of the heart before, but here God promises that He will do this work Himself! He will transform the hearts of His people, so they will desire what He desires and love what He loves.

> [!important]+ Reflect and Respond
Do you have a new heart? Are you growing to love God more? Are you being transformed daily to be more like Him, from the inside out? Take time to pray today. Thank God for His endless grace to you, and ask Him to continue changing your heart so you can obey Him more and more.
