### <center>耶利哥的“战役”</center>

> [!info]- 🎙️Audio: [A Daily Devotional - 03.14 - CN]()


约书亚其实并没有亲自参与耶利哥的战役，以色列人也没有。实际上，这场战役根本不算是一场真正的战斗。神为约书亚和以色列人打了这场“战役”，而且这场战斗是极为不平衡的。

如果你不相信这一点，可以从《约书亚记》6章的前几节开始看。神在这里给了约书亚一个历史上最奇特的作战计划。神吩咐约书亚，让百姓连续六天绕着耶利哥城行走，祭司们与百姓一同走，手持号角，抬着约柜。在第七天，以色列军队要绕城走七圈，之后祭司吹响号角，百姓大声喊叫，耶利哥城的城墙便会倒塌。没有任何军事策略，也没有侵占城市的详细计划。就这样，绕城走十三圈，吹响号角，高声呐喊。神到底在做什么呢？神正在向百姓显明，祂，只有祂，才会为百姓打胜仗，带领他们进入应许之地。这就是神向约书亚发出的话：“看哪，我已将耶利哥交在你手中了”（6:2）。

果然，事情照着神所说的发生了。百姓在约书亚的带领下，遵循神的指示，绕城走了六天，第七天绕了七圈。号角响起，百姓喊叫，城墙倒塌。接下来，百姓轻松地走进城中，几乎没有遇到什么阻力，便控制了这座城市。然而，《约书亚记》的作者特别提到了一位女性及她的家人，他们的结局与耶利哥其他人截然不同。拉哈布——曾经的妓女，在对神的信心中站在神的百姓一边——被神的百姓救出了，并成为神的家族的一员。即使在神对祂百姓敌人的审判之中，神仍然向拉哈布显明了祂的恩典。

> [!important]+ 反思与回应
我们有时会忘记，我们所信的是一位不需要我们帮助的神。我们常常试图以各种方式“帮忙”祂。但神——无论过去还是现在——都希望为祂的百姓打胜仗。祂愿意引领我们，指导我们，赐给我们力量，并通过祂在基督里的恩典拯救我们。今天，请为自己祷告，求神帮助你完全信靠祂，信任祂为你打每一场战斗——包括你与罪恶与死亡之间的最大一场战斗。

### <center>The “Battle” of Jericho</center>

> [!question]+ Review
> 1. ⁠Why does God command the people to restore the covenant signs of circumcision and the Passover? What significance do these covenant signs have for God’s people?
> 2. ⁠What lessons can leaders learn from Joshua’s humility and obedience when he encounters the commander of the Lord’s army?
> 3. ⁠How can we today understand baptism and the Lord’s Supper as the signs of the new covenant, and how can we practice these sacraments in our lives?

📖 **Passage to read**: ==Joshua 06==

> [!info]- 🎙️Audio: [A Daily Devotional - 03.14 - EN]()  

Joshua didn’t actually fight the battle of Jericho. Neither did the people of Israel. In reality, the battle wasn’t much of a battle at all. God fought this “battle” for Joshua and the people, and it turned out to be a pretty one-sided contest.

If you’re unsure, start by looking at the first few verses of Joshua 6. It’s there that God gives Joshua one of the strangest battle plans in military history. God tells Joshua to have the people march around the city of Jericho for six days in a row, with priests walking with them, holding trumpets and carrying the ark. On the seventh day, the Israelite army is to march around the city seven times. Then the priests will blow the trumpets, the people will shout, and the walls of Jericho will collapse. No battle tactics. No detailed plan for taking the city. Just walking around the city thirteen times, blowing trumpets, and shouting. What is God doing here? God is showing the people that He, and He alone, will fight for them to bring them into the promised land. That’s how God begins His message to Joshua: “See, I have given Jericho into your hand” (6:2).

And sure enough, everything happens just as God said it would. The people, led by Joshua, obey God’s instructions. They march around the city for six days, and then seven times on the seventh day. The trumpets are blown, the people shout, and the walls fall down. After that, it’s easy for the Israelites—they simply walk in and face almost no resistance as they take the city. But the writer of Joshua makes sure to point out what happens to one woman and her family, whose story is different from the rest of Jericho’s people. Rahab—a former prostitute who chose to align herself with God’s people in faith—is spared by the Israelites and becomes part of God’s community. Even in the judgment He brings on the enemies of His people, God shows grace to Rahab.

> [!important]+ Reflect and Respond
Sometimes we forget that we serve a God who doesn’t need our help. We often try to “assist” Him in different ways. But God—now and always—wants to fight for His people. He wants to lead us, guide us, empower us, and save us by His gracious action in Christ. Pray today that you would trust God to take care of you completely. Trust Him to fight your battles—including your greatest battle against sin and death.
