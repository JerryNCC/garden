### <center>以色列的王敬拜那位王</center>

> [!info]- 🎙️Audio: [A Daily Devotional - 04.21 - CN]()

在《撒母耳记下》第六章中，庆祝活动继续进行。大卫，神所膏立的以色列王，已经在犹大和以色列两地稳固地掌握了王权。人民齐心协力支持他，神也在战斗中赐予他胜利，打败了敌人的非利士人。接下来，大卫的任务是将约柜带回耶路撒冷，这是他统治的中心城市。然而，这本应是一次纯粹的庆祝时刻，却因两件发生的事件而带上了严肃的教训。

第一件事涉及一个名叫乌撒的人，他在协助运送约柜。当队伍向耶路撒冷前进时，拉车的牛突然跌倒。乌撒没有多想，就伸手去扶约柜，以防它摔落。这一动作直接违反了神的命令——明确规定没有人可以触摸约柜。因而，乌撒立刻被神击杀。即便是大卫，也因这一事件感到震惊，并对神产生了深深的敬畏。神为什么要这样做呢？神是在提醒大卫和以色列百姓，祂的圣洁远比一切都重要——甚至比人的生命还要重要。神才是祂百姓的真正王——那位统治大卫的王。这位王是无限圣洁、充满公义的。

第二件事介绍了大卫的妻子米甲，她是扫罗的女儿。当约柜终于被带入耶路撒冷时，我们看到了大卫谦卑和敬拜神的心。在看到约柜回归神的子民之时，大卫“在耶和华面前跳跃、舞蹈”（6:16）。人民因大卫真诚的敬拜和对神的喜乐而爱戴他，这展现了他对神和百姓的深厚感情。然而，米甲却不高兴。她严厉地责备大卫，指责他像“那些无耻的男人一样，露出自己”（6:20）。作为扫罗的女儿，米甲认为国王应当严肃、庄重。但大卫，作为一个合神心意的人，知道神的王子应当以对真神的热情敬拜为标志。

> [!important]+ 反思与回应
我们所敬拜的神，本可以像击杀乌撒一样立即将我们所有人除掉。然神却选择了施恩与怜悯，将自己的儿子钉死在十字架上，替代罪人受死。今天，让我们带着极大的喜乐赞美神！

### <center>Israel’s King Worships the King</center>

> [!question]+ Review
> 1. ⁠How does David's transformation from a shepherd boy to a king reflect God's sovereignty and plan in his life? What can we learn about God's guidance and arrangement from this?
> 2. ⁠Why do the people of Israel choose to confirm David as king in 2 Samuel 5? What does this decision mean for their faith life and collective identity?
> 3. ⁠How can we, like the people of Israel, unite around Jesus as our King and Leader? How can we express our loyalty to Jesus in our daily lives?

📖 **Passage to read**: ==2 Samuel 06==

> [!info]- 🎙️Audio: [A Daily Devotional - 04.21 - EN]()  

The celebration continues in 2 Samuel 6 as David, the newly anointed king of God’s people, is firmly established over both Judah and Israel. The people are united in their support of him, and God is giving him victories in battle over the enemy Philistines. The next step for David is to bring the Ark of the Covenant back to Jerusalem, the central city of his rule. What should have been a time of pure celebration, however, is overshadowed by two incidents that carry a serious message.

The first event involves a man named Uzzah, who is helping oversee the transport of the Ark. As the procession moves toward Jerusalem, the oxen pulling the cart stumble. Without thinking, Uzzah reaches out to steady the Ark. His action directly breaks God’s command, which clearly stated that no one should touch the Ark. Because of this, Uzzah is struck dead by God on the spot. Even David is shaken by the event and struck with fear. Why did God do this? God was reminding David and the people that His holiness is far more important than anything else—even human life. God is the true King of His people, the King who rules over King David as well. And this King is infinitely holy and just.

The second event introduces David’s wife, Michal, who is the daughter of Saul. As the Ark is finally brought into Jerusalem, we see a glimpse of David’s humble and worshipful heart. Overjoyed by the return of the Ark to Jerusalem, David is “leaping and dancing before the LORD” (6:16). The people adore him for his sincere worship and genuine joy in the Lord, showing his heart of love for both God and the people. Michal, however, is not pleased. She confronts David with harsh words, accusing him of acting like “one of the vulgar fellows [who] shamelessly uncovers himself” (6:20). Michal, being Saul’s daughter, believes a king should act with seriousness and dignity. But David, a man after God’s own heart, knows that a king of God’s people should be known for his passionate worship of the true King.

> [!important]+ Reflect and Respond
We serve a God who, in His justice, could have struck us all dead, just like Uzzah by the Ark. Yet, this is the same God who chose to show mercy and grace by allowing His own Son to be struck dead in our place. Praise God for this today, with great joy.
