### <center>耶稣是我们的标准</center>

> [!info]- 🎙️Audio: [None]()

当我们来到登山宝训时，首先要注意耶稣的听众。尽管众多群众围绕着他，但马太清楚记载：“耶稣看见许多的人，就上了山，既坐下，门徒到他跟前来。”（太5:1）因此，接下来的教训，并不是向普通群众，而是向已经选择跟随他的门徒所说的。这一点非常重要。

接着，耶稣对律法发表了重要的声明。他说：“不要以为我来要废掉律法和先知，我来不是要废掉，乃是要成全。”（太5:17）有人可能认为耶稣反对律法，或者来放宽圣洁的要求。但耶稣说的是相反的。他强调，门徒的义必须超过当时最虔诚的法利赛人的义。耶稣并不是削弱圣洁和顺服的要求，反而提高了标准。

在教导中，耶稣重复一个模式：“你们听见有话说……只是我告诉你们……”（太5:21–22，27–28，31–32）对于当时的律法师，这会是极大的震撼。耶稣不是在重复传统，也不是传递人类的教导。祂以自己的权柄诠释并应用神的律法，直接向神的子民发言。祂的话语承载着神旨意的全部权威。

这向我们展示了登山宝训的核心：一切都围绕着耶稣本人。祂是完全成全律法的那一位。祂拥有解释和应用律法的权柄。对门徒而言，现在的圣洁标准不再只是律法的字句，而是耶稣本人。跟随祂意味着将生命塑造成与祂相似的样式，在各方面越来越像主耶稣基督。

> [!important]+ 反思与回应
所以，让我们祷告：愿我们以耶稣为圣洁的标准，感谢神因祂的名所赐的救恩和义。求圣灵帮助我们在顺服中成长，使我们的生命更多地反映救主的样式。

### <center>Jesus Is the Standard</center>

> [!question]+ Review
> 1.⁠ ⁠Why was Jesus led by the Spirit into the wilderness? (Matt 4:1)
2.⁠ ⁠What were the three temptations Satan presented to Jesus, and how did Jesus respond? (Matt 4:3–10)
3.⁠ ⁠What does it mean that Jesus is described as the “perfect and true Israel” in the text?

📖 **Passage to read**: ==Matthew 05==

> [!info]- 🎙️Audio: [None]()  

When we come to the Sermon on the Mount, we should first notice who Jesus is speaking to. Crowds had gathered around him, but Matthew is clear: “Seeing the crowds, he went up on the mountain, and when he sat down, his disciples came to him” (5:1). So, the words that follow are directed not to the general crowd, but to his disciples—those who had already chosen to follow him. That matters a great deal.

Then Jesus makes an important statement about the law. He says, “Do not think that I have come to abolish the Law or the Prophets; I have not come to abolish them but to fulfill them” (5:17). Some people think Jesus was against the law, that he came to lower the standards or make holiness easier. But Jesus says the opposite. He insists that his disciples’ righteousness must exceed even that of the Pharisees, the most devoted religious leaders of the day. Rather than lessening the weight of holiness and obedience, Jesus is raising it.

As he continues, Jesus sets a pattern in his teaching. He repeats the phrase, “You have heard that it was said … but I say to you …” (5:21–22, 27–28, 31–32). For anyone listening, especially teachers of the law, this would have been startling. Jesus is not just quoting tradition or passing along human teaching. He is speaking with his own authority, interpreting and applying God’s law directly to God’s people. His words carry the full weight of God’s will.

This shows us the heart of the Sermon on the Mount: it is centered on Jesus himself. He is the one who fulfills the law perfectly. He is the one who has the authority to explain and apply it. And now, for his disciples, the standard is no longer just the letter of the law. The standard is Jesus. To follow him means to shape our lives after him, becoming more and more like him in every way.

> [!important]+ Reflect and Respond
So let us pray that we will look to Jesus as our measure of holiness. Thank God for the salvation and righteousness that come in his name. And ask the Spirit to help us grow in obedience, that our lives might reflect more of our Savior.
