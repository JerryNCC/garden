### <center>亚干的罪</center>

> [!info]- 🎙️Audio: [A Daily Devotional - 03.15 - CN]()

《约书亚记》第7章以一种阴沉的语调开始：有一个人，名叫亚干，违背了神的命令，将耶利哥的战利品据为己有，而没有归入耶和华的库中。这是对神通过约书亚所下达命令的公然违背，我们知道这对亚干来说不会有好结果。但我们可能没想到的是，这对整个神的子民也不会有好结果。

当他们准备征服下一座城时，他们的期望很高，士气也很旺盛。攻打艾城的行动应该会像攻打耶利哥一样顺利，对吧？错了。他们被艾城的军队击败，并被赶出了那片土地。约书亚感到震惊，只能俯伏在神面前。神对约书亚说话，清楚地告诉他发生了什么：有人违背了祂的命令。神引导约书亚找出罪魁祸首，亚干的罪被揭露出来：他偷了一件外衣、一些银子和金子，并将这些财宝藏在他的帐篷底下。惩罚是迅速、果断且严厉的；亚干和他的全家因这罪被石头打死并被焚烧。

这段经文很难理解，也可能让人难以接受。我们能从《约书亚记》第7章中学到什么？首先，我们需要明白，神的子民中一个人的罪会影响整个群体。神惩罚了亚干，但整个以色列民族都因他的罪而承受了后果——他们的战士在攻打艾城的失败中丧生。罪从来不是完全个人化或孤立的；它总是会对群体产生影响。

其次，我们需要看到，神对罪的态度极其严肃，往往比我们想象的更严肃。亚干和他的全家因他的罪被处死。为什么？因为神的圣洁甚至比人的生命更重要。在神的子民中，没有贪婪、自私和违背祂命令的余地。神希望人们顺服祂，并将祂看得比世上的一切都重要。

> [!important]+ 反思与回应
我们知道，神通过耶稣基督赐给我们恩典；若没有祂，我们都会落得和亚干一样的结局！今天请祷告，求神的恩典激励你每天更加认真地对待罪。求祂帮助你看到，罪不仅影响你，也影响你整个信仰群体——你的家人、朋友和教会。

### <center>Achan’s Sin</center>

> [!question]+ Review
> 1. ⁠What was the battle plan God gave to Joshua in Joshua 6? How does this plan differ from typical military strategies?  
> 2. ⁠How did the walls of Jericho fall? What does this event reveal about God fighting for His people?  
> 3. ⁠What is the significance of Rahab’s story in the destruction of Jericho? How does her outcome demonstrate God’s grace?

📖 **Passage to read**: ==Joshua 07==

> [!info]- 🎙️Audio: [A Daily Devotional - 03.15 - EN]()  


Joshua 7 starts with a dark tone: one man, Achan, disobeys God by taking treasure from Jericho for himself instead of giving it to the Lord’s treasury. This is a clear violation of God’s command given through Joshua, and we know this won’t end well for Achan. What we might not expect is that it won’t end well for the entire people of God either.

As they prepare for their next battle in conquering the land, their hopes are high, and their spirits are strong. The invasion of Ai should go as smoothly as Jericho, right? Wrong. The people are defeated by Ai’s army and driven out of the land. Joshua is stunned and can only fall on his face before God. God speaks to Joshua and makes it clear what happened: someone in the community has disobeyed His command. God guides Joshua to identify the culprit, and Achan’s sin is revealed: he stole a cloak, some silver, and some gold, hiding them under his tent. The punishment is swift, decisive, and severe; Achan and his entire family are stoned and burned because of his sin.

This is a tough passage, and it can be hard to accept. What can we learn from Joshua 7? First, we need to understand that sin by one member of God’s community affects the whole community. God punished Achan, but the entire nation of Israel felt the consequences of his sin when their men died in the failed attack on Ai. Sin is never just personal or isolated; it always impacts others.

Second, we need to see that God takes sin extremely seriously, often more seriously than we do. Achan and his family were put to death for his sin. Why? Because God’s holiness is more important than even human life. There’s no place in God’s community for greed, selfishness, or rejecting His word. God wants people who will obey Him and value Him above everything else.

> [!important]+ Reflect and Respond
We know God gives us grace through Jesus Christ; without Him, we’d all share Achan’s fate. Pray today that God’s grace would move you to take sin more seriously every day. Ask Him to help you see that sin doesn’t just affect you but also your whole community—your family, friends, and church.
