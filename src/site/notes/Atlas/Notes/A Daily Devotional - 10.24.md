### <center>扎根与结果的人生</center>

你是否曾与至亲挚爱的人道别？也许是祖父母，也许是一位至交。那一刻的谈话，你大概至今仍记忆犹新。《使徒行传》第二十章便记载了这样一个动人的场景：使徒保罗向以弗所教会的长老们作最后的嘱咐。这是他亲手建立的教会之一，而他知道，这将是他们最后一次见面。可想而知，他们一定深深铭记他临别的叮咛。

保罗首先提醒他们自己一生最看重的事——那就是福音。他提起自己在他们中间时，从未退缩，不论什么对他们有益处的事，他都毫不保留地传讲。他的信息简单却充满力量：人当向神悔改，并信靠主耶稣基督（徒20:20–21）。稍后，他又说，因自己已将“神一切的旨意都传给他们听”，所以他在神面前是清白的（徒20:27）。换句话说，保罗已经尽了作传道人该尽的本分。他的临别话语，从始至终都围绕着福音的核心。

接着，保罗转向一个或许出人意料的主题——慷慨。他提醒以弗所人，当他在他们中间时，从未贪图他们的金银财物，反而亲手劳作，帮助软弱的人。最后，他以一句耶稣的话作结：“施比受更为有福。”

为什么保罗要以“施予”来作为离别的总结呢？因为在他看来，慷慨正是福音在生命中结出的真实果子。一个被福音扎根、改变的人，必然会以爱与奉献来回应他人。

保罗渴望以弗所的信徒，不仅持守真理，更要让福音在他们的生命中开花结果——活出无私、乐善好施的生命见证。

> [!important]+ 反思与回应
那么，你呢？福音是否已成为你生命的中心？你的信仰是否在生活中结出慷慨的果实？求神使你勇敢传扬耶稣基督的救恩，也求祂赐你一颗乐意给予的心，因为你最宝贵的财富，已经在基督里得着。

> [!question]+ Review
> 1. What kind of social and cultural environment did Paul encounter in Athens, and how did he adjust his approach to fit his audience?
> 2. When Paul saw the altar “to an unknown god,” how did he use it as a bridge to share the gospel? What can we learn from this for our own evangelism today?
> 3. How did the Athenians respond differently to Paul’s message, and what lessons can we learn from this about sharing the gospel and trusting God’s work?


📖 **Passage to read**: ==使徒行传 20.17-38==

> [!info]- 🎙️Audio: [None]()  

Have you ever said goodbye to someone you deeply love—maybe a grandparent or a close friend? If so, you probably remember that last conversation very clearly. In Acts 20, we read about such a moment: Paul’s farewell to the elders of the church in Ephesus. This was one of the churches he helped start, and he knew it would be the last time he’d see them. You can imagine how seriously everyone took his final words.

Paul begins by reminding them of what mattered most to him—the gospel. He recalls how, during his time with them, he “did not shrink from declaring” anything that would help them grow. His message was simple but powerful: people must turn to God in repentance and put their faith in Jesus Christ (20:20–21). Later, Paul explains that because he has taught them “the whole counsel of God,” he is innocent of their blood—he has done his duty as a faithful messenger of the gospel (20:27). Paul’s farewell is soaked in the message of Jesus.

But then Paul turns to a topic that might surprise us—generosity. He reminds the Ephesians that when he was with them, he never desired their silver or gold. Instead, he worked hard to help others and to set an example of care for the weak. Paul ends his speech with a simple but powerful reminder of Jesus’ own words: “It is more blessed to give than to receive.”

Why would Paul end his final message this way? Because generosity is one of the clearest signs that the gospel has truly taken root in a person’s heart. A life shaped by the gospel will always bear fruit—especially in selfless giving and love toward others.

Paul wanted the Ephesian believers to remain grounded in the gospel and to let it shape their lives. That’s his parting wish.

> [!important]+ Reflect and Respond
So what about you? Is the gospel of Jesus at the center of your life? Is it producing fruit in the way you live and give? Ask God to make you bold in sharing the good news of Jesus. Pray that your heart would be generous toward others, knowing that your true treasure is in Christ himself.
