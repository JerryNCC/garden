### <center>昂贵的一杯水</center>

> [!info]- 🎙️Audio: [A Daily Devotional - 04.30 - CN]()

电影 《角斗士》 讲述了一位蒙羞的罗马将军——马克西穆斯，他凭借在竞技场上的英勇表现重新赢得荣耀。而 《勇敢的心》 则以好莱坞的方式再现了苏格兰英雄威廉·华莱士率军抗击英格兰统治者的故事。然而，撒母耳记下 23 章 中所描述的勇士们，比他们更加英勇非凡。他们奋勇作战，誓死效忠他们的王大卫，因为他们深信他值得追随。

这些勇士的英勇令人惊叹。约设巴设别用一支长矛，在一场战斗中击杀了 八百名敌人。沙玛在非利士人来犯之际，独自一人坚守阵地，即便同伴们四散而逃，他依然誓死捍卫自己的土地，最终取得胜利。比拿雅，这位曾在坑中徒手击杀狮子的勇士，面对一名强壮的埃及人时，仅凭一根棍杖迎战。他巧妙地夺过对方的长矛，反手将其杀死。这些人为何如此奋战？因为他们对大卫王忠心耿耿，愿意为捍卫神所拣选的王付上任何代价。

然而，这段经文中最能彰显大卫王价值的，不是这些英勇战绩，而是三个勇士的故事。他们冒着生命危险，冲破非利士人的防线，只为了给大卫取一杯井水。但当他们将水带回时，大卫的反应出乎意料——他拒绝饮用。相反，他将水倒在地上，作为献给神的祭物，并称这水为勇士们以生命换来的血。在大卫眼中，他忠诚的战士们比自己的需求更加重要。

这段经文展现了一幅忠诚与敬重的美丽画面。然而，它的结尾却令人沉思。在大卫的勇士名单中，最后一个名字是谁？赫人乌利亚——那位被大卫夺取妻子的勇士，那位被大卫谋害的忠臣。大卫是伟大的王，却不是完美的王。他最终辜负了自己最忠诚的战士。而这正提醒我们，以色列仍在等待一位真正的王——一位不会背叛子民，而是愿意舍命救赎他们的王。

> [!important]+ 反思与回应
今天，让我们向神祈求勇气，像这些勇士一样，忠心跟随耶稣。求神赐下力量，使我们刚强抵挡罪恶，勇敢为真理而战，并无论付出何等代价，都坚定不移地忠于基督。

### <center>A Costly Cup of Water</center>

> [!question]+ Review
> 1. How does David describe God in 2 Samuel 22:2-3? How do these metaphors reflect God's role in his life?
> 2. In 2 Samuel 22:8-16, what imagery does David use to describe God's appearance? How do these descriptions emphasize God's power?
> 3. In 2 Samuel 22:21, David says, "The Lord has dealt with me according to my righteousness." Does this mean he considers himself sinless? What is the true meaning behind this statement?

📖 **Passage to read**: ==2 Samuel 23.08-39==

> [!info]- 🎙️Audio: [A Daily Devotional - 04.30 - EN]()  

The movie Gladiator tells the story of Maximus, a disgraced Roman general who regains honor through his courage in the Colosseum. Braveheart gives us a Hollywood version of William Wallace, the Scottish leader who fought against English rule. But the warriors described in 2 Samuel 23 go beyond both of them. These men fought fiercely for their king, David, because they believed he was worth following.

Their courage was remarkable. Josheb-basshebeth took down eight hundred men in a single battle with just his spear. Shammah stood his ground when the Philistines attacked, even as his fellow soldiers ran away—he refused to give up and won the fight. Benaiah, a man known for killing a lion in a pit, faced off against a powerful Egyptian. Armed with only a staff, he took the Egyptian’s spear and used it against him. Why did these men fight with such bravery? Because they were fiercely loyal to David. They were willing to risk everything to defend God’s chosen king.

But what really highlights David’s worthiness in this passage? It’s the story of three warriors who risked their lives to bring him a cup of water. They broke through enemy lines just to fetch water from a well for their king. But when they returned, David did something unexpected—he refused to drink it. Instead, he poured it out as an offering to God, calling it the blood of the men who had risked their lives. To David, the lives of his men were too valuable for such a small personal comfort.

This passage shows an incredible picture of devotion and honor. But it ends with a sobering reminder. Who is listed last among David’s mighty men? Uriah the Hittite—the man whose wife David took, the man David had killed. David was a great king, but he was not the perfect King. He failed his own loyal warrior in the worst possible way. This reminds us that God’s people still needed a greater King—one who would never betray His followers but instead lay down His own life for them.

> [!important]+ Reflect and Respond
Today, ask God for the courage to follow Jesus with the same kind of devotion these warriors had. Pray for strength to fight against sin, stand for truth, and remain faithful to Christ—no matter the cost.
