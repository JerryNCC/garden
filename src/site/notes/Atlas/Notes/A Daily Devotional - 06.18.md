### <center>挣扎是真实的</center>

> [!info]- 🎙️Audio: [A Daily Devotional - 06.18 - CN]()

约伯记第三章，书中一个新的篇章展开了——约伯与他的三位朋友，也就是所谓的“安慰者”，展开了一场漫长的对话。这段对话将持续四十章，而约伯的朋友们有很多话要说。这节经文重点呈现了约伯的首次长篇独白——他在极度痛苦中发出的哀叹。

读这章时，你会感受到约伯言语中的痛苦。他与三位朋友默坐了七天七夜，期间不断用碎瓦片刮擦自己发痒难耐的皮肤。终于，他开口了，倾诉出满腔的悲伤和苦涩。约伯咒诅自己出生的那一天，甚至希望自己从未出生。他的话语揭示出一个生命遭遇极大破碎的人，甚至觉得死去比活着更好。约伯甚至表达了对死亡的渴望，生活中已无任何喜乐可言。他用冷冷的话语总结自己的痛苦：“我叹息当作我的食物，我的哀声如水滚滚而流……我无宁日，惟有黑暗临到我身”（约伯记3:24-26）。这正是一个生命被无尽苦难缠绕的人的心声。

在这里，神的话语向我们显明了一个义人、敬虔且忠心的人所经历的真实痛苦。约伯没有用宗教套话或空洞安慰来掩饰自己的伤痛。他坦诚地向朋友和神倾诉自己的哀痛。约伯爱神，敬拜神，神也看他为忠心。然而，他没有软化或掩盖自己的痛苦，而是清楚而诚实地描述出来。虽然痛苦深重，却没有使他怀疑神的品格或心生愤怒。约伯坚定地持守信心，拒绝放弃对神的信靠。

> [!important]+ 反思与回应
今天，祷告求神帮助你成为像约伯那样的人——在挣扎中仍然诚实，却始终忠于耶稣。求神赐你力量，帮助你在最艰难的时刻仍紧紧抓住祂和祂的话语。

### <center>The Struggle Is Real</center>

> [!question]+ Review
> 1. Why did Satan believe that if Job’s health was taken away, Job would abandon God?
> 2. ⁠How did Job respond to his wife’s advice during his severe suffering?
> 3. On what foundation was Job’s faith built that allowed him to trust God even in the midst of suffering?

📖 **Passage to read**: ==Job 03==

> [!info]- 🎙️Audio: [A Daily Devotional - 06.18 - EN]()  

In Job 3, a new section of the book begins—a long conversation between Job and his friends, who are called “comforters.” This dialogue will continue for forty chapters, and Job’s friends have plenty to say. This passage shows Job’s first long speech—a cry of deep sorrow during his terrible suffering.

As you read, you can feel the pain in Job’s words. He has been sitting quietly with his three friends for seven days, scraping his painful skin with a broken piece of pottery. At last, he speaks. What comes out is grief and bitterness. Job curses the day he was born. He wishes he had never existed. His words reveal a man whose life has fallen apart so badly that death seems better than life. Job even expresses a desire to die. Nothing brings him joy anymore. He sums up his pain with these bleak words: “For my sighing comes instead of my bread, and my groanings are poured out like water.… I have no rest, but trouble comes” (Job 3:24–26). This is the voice of a man whose life feels like endless suffering.

At this point, God’s word shows us real pain from a man who is righteous, godly, and faithful. Job doesn’t hide behind religious sayings or easy answers. Instead, he openly expresses his anguish to his friends and to God. He loves and worships God, and God sees him as faithful. Yet Job does not soften or hide his suffering. He describes it clearly and honestly. Even though his pain is great, it does not turn into anger or doubt about God’s character. Job stays faithful to God, refusing to give up on his faith.

> [!important]+ Reflect and Respond
Today, pray that God will help you be like Job—honest about your struggles but faithful to Jesus no matter what. Ask God for strength to hold on to Him and His word, even in the hardest times.
