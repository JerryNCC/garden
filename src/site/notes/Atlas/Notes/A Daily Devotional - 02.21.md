### <center>任何人都能做到，但神选择祂的领袖</center>

> [!info]- 🎙️Audio: [A Daily Devotional - 02.21 - CN]()

以色列人依然在旷野中徘徊，摩西作为神所选的领袖引导着他们。然而，出现了一个问题。摩西的哥哥亚伦和姐姐米利暗开始心生愤怒和嫉妒。在《民数记》第十二章中，他们决定挑战神对摩西的选召，质疑摩西作为领袖的地位。他们认为自己能够做得更好，并开始表达不满。表面上，他们似乎对摩西娶的古实女子心生不满，但问题的实质远不止如此。无论是摩西的妻子西坡拉，还是另一位妻子，核心问题是摩西作为神百姓的独特角色。亚伦和米利暗渴望更多的权力、权威和荣耀。他们认为自己在神的使用中与摩西不相上下。他们的骄傲和自私驱使他们反对自己的兄弟。

然而，神在这段经文中指出了一个关键问题。摩西不仅仅是一个普通的领袖；他是神为祂的百姓特别选立的领袖。神对亚伦和米利暗明确指出，摩西与祂有着独特的关系。神与摩西“面对面”交谈（12:8），这是神赐予摩西的特殊恩典，表明摩西的领导角色并非他自愿选择，而是神亲自设立的。反对摩西，就是反对神。米利暗和亚伦的嫉妒和骄傲，不仅是对摩西的反叛，更是对神治理他们的拒绝。

神对他们叛逆的回应迅速而严厉。在第四节，圣经写道：“耶和华忽然对摩西、亚伦和米利暗说话。”神降下大麻风，使米利暗得病，这是一种使她在百姓中不洁的皮肤病。这是一个明显而可怕的提醒，表明罪的力量是如此强大，一旦它占据我们的心，便会在我们的生活中留下深刻的印记。

> [!important]+ 反思与回应
每当我们犯罪时，其实我们正做着米利暗和亚伦所做的事。我们拒绝让耶稣引导我们，反而执意要自我领导。请花些时间，向神认罪，承认最近在何处抵抗祂的引导。求祂帮助你谦卑地跟随耶稣，记住祂是你生命的主，也是你灵魂的救主。

### <center>Anyone Can Do It, But God Chooses His Leaders</center>

> [!question]+ Review
> 1.⁠ ⁠What is the core issue of the Israelites' complaint in this passage? What are they truly longing for?

> 3.⁠ ⁠What lessons can we learn from this passage about submitting to God and trusting His promises?

📖 **Passage to read**: ==Numbers 12==

> [!info]- 🎙️Audio: [A Daily Devotional - 02.21 - EN]()  

The Israelites are still wandering in the wilderness, being led by God’s chosen leader, Moses. But there’s a problem. Moses’s brother, Aaron, and his sister, Miriam, start to get angry and envious. In Numbers 12, they decide to challenge God’s choice of Moses as the leader. They think they can do a better job and begin to express their dissatisfaction. On the surface, it seems like their issue is with Moses’s wife, a Cushite woman, but this isn’t really the heart of the matter. Whether it’s Moses’s first wife, Zipporah, or a second wife, the real issue is Moses’s unique role as the leader of God’s people. Aaron and Miriam want more authority, more recognition, and more power. They believe they’ve been used by God just as much as Moses has. Their pride and selfishness drive them to rebel against their own brother.

There’s one big problem, though, that God makes clear in this passage. Moses isn’t just any leader; he is the leader chosen by God for His people. God points this out to Aaron and Miriam, explaining that Moses has a unique relationship with Him. God speaks “mouth to mouth” with Moses (12:8). This is a special privilege and shows that Moses’s leadership isn’t something he chose for himself—it’s a role that God Himself established. To rebel against Moses is to rebel against God. Miriam and Aaron’s jealousy and pride show that they are not only rejecting Moses, but they are also rejecting God’s rule over them.

God’s response to Miriam and Aaron’s rebellion is immediate and severe. In verse 4, we are told, “Suddenly the LORD said to Moses and to Aaron and Miriam.” Miriam is struck with leprosy, a skin disease that would make her unclean in the community. It’s a physical, visible reminder of the devastating power of sin when it’s allowed to take hold of our lives. 

> [!important]+ Reflect and Respond
Every time we sin, we’re doing what Miriam and Aaron did. We refuse to follow Jesus and try to lead ourselves. Take some time to confess to God the ways you’ve done this recently. Ask Him to help you humbly follow your Leader, Jesus, remembering that He is the Lord of your life and the Savior of your soul.
