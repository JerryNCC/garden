### <center>亚哈与先知</center>

> [!info]- 🎙️Audio: [A Daily Devotional - 05.14 - CN]()

对于以色列北国来说，情况似乎已经糟糕透顶了，对吧？他们的领导层已经在罪恶中沉沦到了极点。但接着，亚哈王登场了，他是俄姆利的儿子。就在一切看似不能更糟糕的时候，亚哈找到了让事情变得更糟的方式。尽管在他之前有许多邪恶的以色列君王，亚哈仍然成为了最邪恶的君王。听听对他统治的描述：“亚哈，俄姆利的儿子，在耶和华眼中行恶，超过在他之前的一切君王。若是他行耶罗波安的罪恶还觉得轻松，他就娶了耶洗别为妻，去事奉巴力，拜他”（列王纪上16:30–31）。亚哈不仅允许百姓继续拜偶像，他还亲自引领百姓走向偶像崇拜，甚至为自己找了一个比他更邪恶的妻子！

然而，在以色列历史最黑暗的时刻，神为他们送来了光明。先知以利亚登场了。列王纪上17章介绍了这位先知，他将成为邪恶的亚哈王的强烈对比。他对亚哈说的第一句话便是审判的话：全地将经历两年的干旱。宣告这个预言后，以利亚逃命，藏匿起来。然而，干旱成真了，这证明了以利亚确实是神的先知。这表明神肯定了以利亚的先知身份，并与他同在。神通过让以利亚行神迹，明确了以利亚所说的话是真实的。

因此，在以色列历史最黑暗的时期——当以色列王陷入无法言喻的罪恶与偶像崇拜时——神为祂的百姓兴起了一位真正的先知。以利亚将神的话语带入这个黑暗的局面。尽管亚哈强大，神却使用以利亚——一个看似普通的人——来传讲祂的话语，并以大能行事。神并没有沉默，祂没有忘记祂的百姓和他们的领袖。祂继续通过祂忠心的先知以利亚发声。

> [!important]+ 反思与回应
今天，让我们感谢神，因为祂从不抛弃祂的百姓，祂也没有抛弃你和我。祂已经把祂的话语带进这个充满罪恶的黑暗世界，最有力的方式就是通过道成肉身的耶稣——祂的儿子。今天，反思这些真理时，感谢神。

### <center>Ahab and the Prophet</center>

> [!question]+ Review
> 1. ⁠Why are the kings of Israel described as falling deeper into sin? What sinful patterns can you see in the actions of Baasha, Elah, Zimri, and Omri?
> 2. How does God speak His judgment through the prophets (like Ahijah and Jehu)? What does the role of these prophets represent in Israel’s history?
> 3. ⁠When faced with a message of judgment, how should we respond to God's patience and mercy? What does such a response look like in our lives today?

📖 **Passage to read**: ==1 Kings 16:29-17:24==

> [!info]- 🎙️Audio: [A Daily Devotional - 05.14 - EN]()  

For the northern kingdom of Israel, things couldn’t seem worse, could they? The leaders have sunk as low as possible in sin. But here comes King Ahab, son of Omri. Just when it seems like it couldn’t get any worse, Ahab finds a way to make it worse. Even with all the evil kings that came before him, Ahab manages to be the worst of them all. Listen to the description of his reign: “And Ahab the son of Omri did evil in the sight of the LORD, more than all who were before him. And as if it had been a light thing for him to walk in the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, he took for his wife Jezebel … and went and served Baal and worshiped him” (1 Kings 16:30–31). Not only does Ahab let the people continue worshiping idols, but he also leads them in his personal devotion to Baal worship. And somehow, he finds a wife who is even more wicked than he is.

Yet, at the darkest moment in Israel’s history, God sends a light. Enter Elijah, the prophet. First Kings 17 introduces Elijah, who will serve as the sharp contrast to the evil King Ahab. His first words to Ahab are words of judgment: a drought will come for two years. After delivering this prophecy, Elijah runs and hides from Ahab. The drought comes, proving that Elijah is truly a prophet of God. This shows that God is affirming Elijah’s role as a genuine prophet and aligning Himself with Elijah. God makes it clear that Elijah’s words are true by allowing him to perform great signs.

So, in the darkest period of Israel’s history—when the king of Israel has fallen into unspeakable sin and idolatry—God raises up a true prophet for His people. Elijah will bring God’s message into this dark situation. Even though Ahab is powerful, God uses Elijah, a seemingly ordinary man, to speak His words and act with great power. God is not silent. He has not forgotten His people or their leaders. He continues to speak His word through His faithful prophet, Elijah.

> [!important]+ Reflect and Respond
Let us thank God today that He does not abandon His people. He has not abandoned you or me. He has spoken His word into the darkness of this sinful world, most powerfully through the Word made flesh: Jesus, His Son. Thank God today as you reflect on these truths.
