### <center>聚集聆听上帝的话语</center>

> [!info]- 🎙️Audio: [A Daily Devotional - 02.07 - CN]()


出埃及记的故事开始时，上帝的子民在埃及法老的压迫下为奴。随着上帝为他们预定的拯救计划展开，祂让摩西向法老传达一个明确的信息：“让我的子民去，他们好事奉我”（出埃及记8:1）。摩西一次又一次地把这个信息传达给那固执的埃及王。上帝的目的是把祂的子民从奴役中解救出来，引领他们过上事奉祂的生活。

上帝已经行了奇迹：祂将祂的子民从埃及救出来，赐下天上的玛拿给他们食用，并从磐石中引出水，解他们在旷野中的口渴。现在，上帝对摩西说：“你去使百姓自洁，今天和明天自洁；第三天，耶和华要降临在西奈山，在万民眼前显现”（出埃及记19:10–11）。时刻终于来临，脱离了奴役的百姓将要见到他们的上帝，并开始事奉和敬拜祂。

接下来发生了什么呢？他们举行了盛大的敬拜礼仪吗？他们开始歌颂上帝吗？上帝是否派遣他们去做某项任务？并没有。出埃及记20章的第一句话是：“上帝吩咐了这一切的话” （出埃及记20:1）。上帝的子民，在得以脱离奴役之后，聚集在旷野，预备等待。然后——上帝开始对他们说话。这就是对上帝的敬拜与事奉：祂的子民集聚一堂，预备好自己，等待着，怀着愿意顺从祂话语的心听祂说话。

虽然我们在这里不能详细探讨所有的诫命，但有一点至关重要，那就是时间的安排。这些诫命是上帝给那些祂已经拯救出来的百姓的律法。上帝并没有在他们仍然在埃及时就将诫命交给他们，让他们的顺服成为他们获得自由的条件。相反，上帝先拯救了他们，然后才教导他们如何出于爱与感恩来顺服祂。

> [!important]+ 反思与回应
上帝救赎祂的子民脱离奴役，是为了他们能够聚集在一起，聆听并遵行祂的话语来事奉祂。今天，我们也可以祈祷，求上帝帮助我们以祂所喜悦的方式敬拜与事奉祂。祈求我们每天都能致力于聆听祂的话语，并依照祂的话语去行。

📖 **Passage to read**: ==Exodus 20==

> [!info]- 🎙️Audio: [A Daily Devotional - 02.20 - EN]()  

The story of Exodus begins with God's people in slavery under Pharaoh in Egypt. As God planned their deliverance, He had Moses deliver a clear message to Pharaoh: "Let my people go, that they may serve me" (8:1). Moses repeated this message again and again to the stubborn king. God's purpose was to bring His people out of slavery and lead them into a life of serving Him.

God had already done the miraculous: He had freed His people from Egypt, provided them with manna from heaven to eat, and brought water from rocks to quench their thirst in the wilderness. Now, God speaks to Moses: “Go to the people and consecrate them today and tomorrow. For on the third day the LORD will come down on Mount Sinai in the sight of all the people” (19:10–11). The moment has come. The people, freed from slavery, are about to meet their God and begin to worship and serve Him.

But what happens next? Do they have a great worship service? Do they start singing songs of praise? Does God send them on a mission to serve? No. The first words of Exodus 20 say, “And God spoke all these words” (20:1). God’s people, freed from slavery, gather together in the wilderness, prepared and waiting. And then—God speaks to them. This is worship and service to God: His people gathering, preparing, waiting, and listening with hearts ready to obey His word.

While we won’t explore all the details of the commandments here, it’s important to note the timing. These words are laws given by God to people He has already saved. He didn’t give them the commandments while they were still in Egypt, making obedience a requirement for their freedom. Instead, God saved them first and then showed them how they could obey Him out of love and gratitude.

> [!important]+ Reflect and Respond
God rescued His people from slavery so they could serve Him by gathering to hear and live under His word. Today, we can pray that God will help us worship and serve Him in the way He desires. Pray that we would commit ourselves to daily listening to His word and obeying it.
