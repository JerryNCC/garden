### <center>神的圣洁</center>

> [!info]- 🎙️Audio: [None]()

要明白《以西结书》，我们先得掌握一些基本背景。到以西结开始宣讲的时候，他已经在巴比伦被掳约五年了。他的听众，是那些已经亲身经历过神因罪而降的审判的人。在他的事奉中，以西结主要针对三个主题：神对自己百姓的审判、神对列国的审判，以及将来神要为祂的子民施行复兴与拯救的日子。而贯穿全书的重要主题之一，就是——神的圣洁。

在被掳多年的日子里，以西结蒙神赐下异象。第一次的异象，从“暴风”、从“发火的火焰”与“大云”开始（1:4）。从其中显出极其奇妙的景象：四个活物——天使。他们行动迅速，如同“闪电的光”一般（1:14）。以西结又看见“轮中套轮”，随着活物同向转动。其上有穹苍，再上面有宝座。宝座上坐着一位形状仿佛人的，周身有火，有辉煌的光辉，并有虹的颜色围绕。无论任何画作、影像，都无法完全描绘以西结所见的荣耀。

这是我们从经文首先要领受的：神的荣耀超越人的言语。以西结已尽力用人间的语言来形容，但人言毕竟有限。神不像我们——祂是无限尊荣的。

虽然以西结无法完全述尽那荣耀的景象，他却给我们示范了最恰当的回应。当他面对神的圣洁、荣美与荣耀时，便俯伏在地。而就在此时，这位圣洁尊荣的神开口对他说话。

> [!important]+ 反思与回应
我们必须谨记：神与我们本质有别。祂是我们的朋友，但祂也是那位我们当俯伏敬拜的主。并且，我们要满心感恩——因着耶稣基督的宝血，我们如今可以亲近这位圣洁的神，爱祂、认识祂，并与祂相交。

### <center>The Holiness of God</center>

> [!question]+ Review
> 1.⁠ ⁠In Lamentations chapter 1, how does Jerusalem acknowledge its sin, and what does this reveal about God’s justice and mercy?
2.⁠ ⁠Why was the fall of Jerusalem almost unimaginable for the Israelites? What does this show about their misunderstandings of God?
3.⁠ ⁠How does the message of this chapter point to the hope found in Jesus Christ? How can we today be a “voice of hope” in the world?

📖 **Passage to read**: ==Ezekiel  01==

> [!info]- 🎙️Audio: [None]()  

To understand the book of Ezekiel, it helps to start with a few basic facts. By the time Ezekiel begins his prophetic work, he has already been living in exile in Babylon for about five years. His audience is made up of people who have already felt God’s judgment for their sin. In his ministry, Ezekiel speaks to three main themes: God’s judgment on his own people, judgment on the nations, and the future day when God will restore and save his people. Running through all of this is one of the book’s biggest themes—the holiness of God.

After years in exile, Ezekiel is given visions of God. The first vision opens with a “stormy wind,” a “great cloud,” and “flashing fire” (1:4). Out of this comes something amazing: four living creatures—angels. They move with incredible speed, “like a flash of lightning” (1:14). Ezekiel also sees something like a wheel within a wheel, moving together with the living creatures. Then above them is a great expanse, and above that expanse is a throne. On the throne is a figure with a human shape, blazing with fire, brilliant light, and colors like a rainbow. No picture or film could ever capture the wonder of what Ezekiel saw.

This is the first thing we must take from the passage: God’s glory is beyond human words. Ezekiel describes it as best he can, but he is working with the limits of human language. God is not like us—he is infinitely greater.

Even though Ezekiel cannot fully describe the vision, he shows us exactly the right response. Faced with God’s holiness, beauty, and glory, he falls on his face. And in that moment, this holy and majestic God speaks to him.

> [!important]+ Reflect and Respond
We must remember this truth: God is “other” than we are. He is our friend, but he is also the one before whom we fall down in worship. And we give thanks that through the blood of Jesus, we can come near to this holy God, to love him and to know him as our own.
