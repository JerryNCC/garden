### <center>你与我同在</center>

想想一个你深爱并熟悉的人。试着想象你花许多时间去阅读关于他的资料，了解他的一切，却始终未曾真正与他建立更深的关系。可悲的是，我们与神的关系往往就是这样。我们学习许多关于祂的真理——这些当然是美好且必要的！但有时，我们就停在知识的层面，忘了神真正渴望的是：借着祂的儿子，与我们建立个人的关系。

大卫所写的诗篇第23篇，描绘了一段这样的关系。大卫不仅“知道”神，更与祂同行、信靠祂，并深深爱着祂。

这篇诗篇以“耶和华是我的牧者”开头。祂不是一个遥远的牧者，而是亲自看顾祂羊群的牧人。祂赐下安息、供应和引导，引领羊群走在正路上。即使行过死荫的幽谷，祂仍紧紧与我们同在。大卫说：“你与我同在。”这句话，改变了一切。

接着，大卫转换了图像。神不只是牧者，更是设宴款待的主：“在我敌人面前，你为我摆设筵席……我的杯满溢。”（诗篇23:5）这是一场充满平安、喜乐与丰盛的筵席。大卫深知，纵使敌人环伺，神仍亲自照顾他。诗篇的结尾是一句充满盼望的宣告：神的恩惠与慈爱必随着他一生，他也必永远住在耶和华的殿中。

那么你呢？神对你而言，是一堆事实和知识，还是一位你真实认识、热爱并敬拜的活神？大卫的祷告让我们看见，神并不遥远。祂愿作你的牧者，引导你、保守你，最终接你进入祂的荣耀同在。祂愿设宴请你同席，让罪、撒但和死亡都无能为力。

这一切，神已借着耶稣成就。

> [!important]+ 反思与回应
今天，就向神祈求吧！不只是知道更多关于祂的事，而是更多地认识祂。感谢祂借着耶稣的生、死与复活，使我们可以亲近祂。赞美祂，因祂愿作你的牧者与款待你的主。也求祂每天帮助你紧紧跟随祂，与这位天父建立真实的关系。

📖 **Passage to read**: ==Psalm 23==

> [!info]- 🎙️Audio: [A Daily Devotional - 07.02 - EN]()  


Think about someone you truly love and know well. Imagine spending hours reading about them, learning every fact—but never really growing closer to them. Sadly, that’s often how we treat our relationship with God. We learn a lot about him—and that’s good and important! But sometimes we stop there, forgetting that God actually wants us to know him personally. Through his Son, God invites us into a real relationship.

Psalm 23, written by David, gives us a picture of that kind of relationship. David doesn’t just know things about God—he walks with him, trusts him, and loves him.

The psalm begins with the image of God as a shepherd. Not just any shepherd, but one who cares deeply for his sheep. He provides them with rest, food, and guidance. He leads them on the right paths and stays close even when they walk through dark and scary places. David says, “You are with me.” That changes everything.

Later, David shifts the picture. God isn’t just his shepherd—he’s also his host. “You prepare a table before me in the presence of my enemies … my cup overflows” (Psalm 23:5). This is a feast of safety, joy, and abundance. David knows that God will take care of him—even when enemies are near. The psalm ends on a strong note of hope: David is sure that God’s goodness and love will follow him all his life, and that he will live with God forever.

What about you? Is God just someone you learn about, or someone you know? Do you worship him as a living person who walks with you and loves you? David’s prayer shows us that God is not distant. He wants to be your shepherd. He wants to guide you, protect you, and welcome you into his presence. He wants to give you a seat at his table—so even sin, Satan, and death lose their power.

And he’s made all this possible through Jesus.

> [!important]+ Reflect and Respond
So today, ask God to help you not only learn about him, but to know him better. Thank him for Jesus—his life, death, and resurrection that bring us close to God. Praise him for being your shepherd and host. And ask him to help you stay close to him every day, walking with your heavenly Father.
