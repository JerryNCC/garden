### <center>恩赐虽多，主却惟一</center>

> [!info]- 🎙️Audio: [None]()

你是否曾经骨折过？哪怕只是手指的一小节，也能带来刺痛与不便。也许还得请医生固定，让它慢慢复原。一个微小的部位受伤，全身都会受到影响。正如保罗所说，教会就是“基督的身体”（12:27），身体的每一部分都同样重要。

哥林多教会充满各样恩赐，人才济济。然而，有些人却开始觉得自己的恩赐比别人更高、更重要。这种心态带来了骄傲与纷争——保罗对此毫不容忍。他提醒他们：“恩赐原有分别，圣灵却是一位；职事也有分别，主却是一位”（12:4–5）。换句话说，恩赐虽多，却都出自同一位神。

保罗用生动的比喻描绘了教会的真实样貌——就像一个活生生的身体。每一个肢体都有独特的功能，却彼此紧密相连。若一只手对头说“我不需要你”，岂不是荒唐？神亲自设计了祂的教会，使每一位信徒都能在其中发挥作用，彼此配搭、共同建造。那些在人看来微不足道的肢体，其实反而是“不可缺少的”（12:22）。当我们轻看别人时，就等于忽略了神的心意。

今天的教会同样需要这样的提醒。我们常不自觉地看重那些显眼、有才华的人，却忽略了神眼中每一个弟兄姊妹的价值。神看重的是合一——一个身体，由不同的肢体组成，却因同一位主而联合。

> [!important]+ 反思与回应
今天，请花一点时间祷告。求神帮助你用祂的眼光看待教会。为祂赐给众人的各样恩赐感恩，并求祂赐你一颗爱人之心，使你珍视每一位属主的弟兄姊妹——不仅是那些显眼的，更包括那些默默服事、同样宝贵的肢体。让我们记得：教会虽有许多肢体，却是一体，在基督里同属一个身体。

### <center>Many Gifts, One God</center>

> [!question]+ Review

📖 **Passage to read**: ==1 Corinthians 12==

> [!info]- 🎙️Audio: [None]()  

Have you ever broken a bone? Even something small—a pinky finger, perhaps—can cause a surprising amount of pain. You might need a doctor to reset it, or a splint to keep it steady. When one small part of the body suffers, the whole body feels it. That’s how important every part of us is. Paul uses this exact picture when he calls the church “the body of Christ” (12:27). Every member matters.

The church in Corinth was full of gifted people. They were talented in many ways. But sadly, some began to think that their gifts were more valuable than those of others. This attitude led to pride and division—something Paul could not ignore. He reminds them, “There are varieties of gifts, but the same Spirit; and there are varieties of service, but the same Lord” (12:4–5). In other words, our gifts may differ, but they come from one God.

Paul paints a vivid picture of what the church should look like—a living body. Each part is different, but every part is essential. It would be absurd, Paul says, for a hand to tell the head it’s not needed. God has designed His church so that each believer contributes something unique and necessary for the whole. Even the members who seem least important are, in fact, “indispensable” (12:22). When we dismiss or ignore others, we are forgetting how God Himself has arranged His body.

We need this reminder today. Churches can easily fall into the same trap—valuing certain people more than others because of their visibility or talents. But God sees differently. He delights in the unity of His people, each one serving according to the grace He has given.

> [!important]+ Reflect and Respond
Take a moment to pray today. Ask God to help you see your church as He does. Thank Him for the many gifts He has placed among His people. And pray that you would love and value every brother and sister in Christ—not just the ones who stand out, but all who belong to the one body of Christ.
