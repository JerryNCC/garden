> The Sentences and Vocabs are based on HSK level 1.
> However I have selected the sentences with new vocabulary. 
> Please use the audios and this note for shadowing and dictation practice.

> [!warning]- **How to do shadowing?**
> - Play the audio, listen to the pronunciation and imitate the pronunciation after listening the first time. 
> - Repeat shadowing will improve your pronunciation.
> - After that try read the words out loud without any help and ask your parents to check your pronunciation. (FEEDBACK very important)

> [!warning]- **How to do dictation?**
> - Practice writing first on a blank paper using this note while playing the audio
> - Mark a cross for the words that you don't know how to write
> - After that focus memorizing on the words you are not familiar
> - After that, test yourself to dictate the words again with the audios.
> - Ask your parents to help checking your handwriting.
