### <center>信心算为义</center>

> [!info]- 🎙️Audio: [A Daily Devotional - 01.13 - CN]()

想象自己是亚伯兰。神赐给了你极大的应许—祝福、繁荣和保护。你渴望信靠祂，但有一个挥之不去的问题让你无法忽视：你和撒莱仍然没有孩子。这正是亚伯兰在《创世记》第15章中向神倾诉的内容：“主耶和华啊，我没有儿女，你还要赐给我什么呢？你没有给我后裔”（15:2–3）。对此，神温柔地重申了祂的应许。第6节尤为重要：“亚伯兰信耶和华，耶和华就以此为他的义。” 首先，亚伯兰相信神，信靠祂的话语。其次，神看见这种信心，将其算为义。

接下来的章节内容可能会让我们感到困惑。神通过一种特殊的仪式，给了亚伯兰一个祂应许的可见记号。在当时，当一位君王征服一群人时，他通常会要求他们执行一个特定的仪式。被征服的一方会与君王立约，将动物劈成两半，并从中间走过。这种行为象征他们的承诺：如果他们背弃誓言，不再侍奉君王，他们就活该像这些动物一样被劈成两半。这是一种极为严肃的誓言，用他们的生命作保证。

亚伯兰按照指示准备了动物，但接下来发生了一件非凡的事情。并非亚伯兰从这些被劈开的动物中间走过，而是我们读到：“有冒烟的炉，并烧着的火把，从那些肉块中经过”（15:17）—象征神同在的记号穿过了这些肉块。是神，而不是亚伯兰，从中间走过。这意味着神以自己的生命作保证，祂在说：“如果我无法履行我的应许，愿我像这些动物一样。” 神确实守住了祂的应许。许多年后，神以人的形态降世，并死在十字架上，以履行祂的约并祝福祂的子民。


> [!important]+ 反思与回应
你希望如何在神的眼中成为义人——正确和良善的人呢？想一想你如何回应神的话语——圣经，它告诉我们关于耶稣的好消息。耶稣为罪而死，能够使罪人成为义人。你相信吗？

### <center>Faith Counted as Righteousness</center>

📖 **Passage to read**: ==Genesis 15==

> [!info]- 🎙️Audio: [A Daily Devotional - 01.13 - EN]()


Imagine being Abram. God has given you incredible promises—blessings, prosperity, and protection. You long to trust Him, but there’s one lingering issue you can’t ignore: you and Sarai still have no children. This is exactly what Abram brings up to God in Genesis 15: “O Lord GOD, what will you give me, for I continue childless… You have given me no offspring” (15:2–3). In response, God gently reaffirms His promises. Verse 6 is key: “And he believed the LORD, and he counted it to him as righteousness.” First, Abram believes God and trusts His word. Second, God sees that faith and credits it as righteousness.

What happens next in the chapter might seem puzzling to us. God gives Abram a visible sign of His promise through a unique ceremony. In those days, when a king conquered a group of people, he would often require them to perform a specific ritual. The conquered group would make a covenant with the king by cutting animals in half and walking between the pieces. This act symbolized their commitment: if they broke their promise to serve the king, they deserved to be cut in half like the animals. It was a solemn pledge, made with their very lives.

Abram prepares the animals as instructed, but then something extraordinary happens. It’s not Abram who walks between the severed animals. Instead, we read that “a smoking fire pot and a flaming torch” (15:17)—symbols of God’s presence—pass through the pieces. God, not Abram, walks through. This means God is making the promise on His own life, saying, “If I fail to keep my promise, may I be like these animals.” And God did keep His promise. Many years later, God came in human form and died on the cross to fulfill His covenant and bless His people.

> [!important]+ Reflect and Respond
> How do you hope to be righteous—right and good—in God’s sight? Think about the way you respond to God’s word, the Bible, which tells us the good news about Jesus, whose death for sin can make sinners righteous. Do you believe it?
