### <center>劳碌中的喜乐</center>

> [!info]- 🎙️Audio: [A Daily Devotional - 07.19 - CN]()

所罗门开始抬头仰望。他尚未走到寻求的终点，但他的心已经在转变。在这一章中，他对上帝的提及变得更为亲密、更为真实。他也开始尊重那些在世间辛勤劳作的人——他们或许并不富有，却在上帝所赐的生活与工作中，得着满足与喜乐。

本章一开始，所罗门提到圣殿——上帝子民敬拜的所在。他要传达的信息是：你们进到圣殿敬拜时，要存敬畏的心。他提醒我们那句耳熟能详的话：在圣洁的神面前，应当寡言，因为祂至高、至圣、超越万有。再次地，所罗门警告我们，在这位无比圣洁、公义、有权能的神面前，我们当谨慎言语与行为。

接着，他又回到关于财富的话题。他提醒我们：财富无法带来真正的满足。富人因忧虑而难以安眠，反倒是那整日辛勤劳作的工人，能享受平静的睡眠。所罗门还讲到，有人因愚昧的投资失策而失去所有。财富可以在瞬间蒸发。所以，若将盼望寄托在金钱上，终将大失所望。

于是，所罗门在他的旅程中进入一个停顿。他尚未给出完整的答案，却指出了一个方向：在神所赐的人生与劳碌中得喜乐，总比哀伤与失望更为美善。他写道：“神赐人一生的日子不多，不如吃喝，且在他一切劳碌中享福，因为这是他的份。”（传5:18）这是一个重要的洞见。在日常的劳作中存感恩之心，享受神所赐的简单恩典，这样的生活实在美好。

然而，问题仍在：若喜乐是正确的生命之道，我们该如何得着真正的喜乐？所罗门此刻尚未完全揭晓答案。

> [!important]+ 反思与回应
所以，我们该自问：你有喜乐吗？在你的生活、工作、人际关系中，有属天的喜乐吗？圣经告诉我们，喜乐不是信徒生活中的“额外奖励”，而是与基督真实关系的自然流露。今日就向神祷告吧。求祂赐你那从祂而来的喜乐，帮助你更深地爱耶稣——以致在日常琐碎中、在工作里、在对话中，你能经历那真正的满足与喜乐。唯有祂，才能使你的心真正欢畅。

### <center>Joy in the Toil</center>

> [!question]+ Review
> 1. ⁠What earthly things did Solomon pursue in Ecclesiastes 2, and what conclusion did he ultimately come to after experiencing them?
> 2. The words “vanity” and “striving after wind” are repeated throughout this chapter—what kind of emotion or reflection do they represent in Solomon’s search for meaning?
> 3. In the end, Solomon says, “This also, I saw, is from the hand of God” (Ecclesiastes 2:24). What kind of hope does this statement offer in the midst of his reflections? How can we understand the idea of “joy from God”?

📖 **Passage to read**: ==Ecclesiastes 05==

> [!info]- 🎙️Audio: [A Daily Devotional - 07.19 - EN]()  

Solomon starts to look higher. He’s not finished with his search yet, but something is shifting. In this chapter, he begins to talk about God in a way that feels more personal, more real. He begins to show respect for ordinary people—those who work hard, who may not have much, but find joy in what God has given them.

He opens the chapter by pointing to the temple, the place where God’s people worship. And what’s his message? Go to worship with reverence. Fear God. Be careful with your words. Why? Because God is holy, far above us. Solomon reminds us to think before we speak—to honor God not just with rituals or promises, but with quiet, humble hearts.

As he keeps going, Solomon turns again to the subject of riches. He warns us that wealth doesn’t satisfy. Rich people can lose sleep, always worrying. But the laborer—the one who works hard all day—can sleep in peace. He even tells of someone who lost everything in a bad business deal. Wealth can vanish in a moment. So if you build your hope on money, you’ll be let down.

And so Solomon reaches a kind of pause in his journey. He doesn’t give a full answer yet, but he does say this: It’s good to find joy in the life and work God has given you. It’s better than misery and frustration. He writes, *“To eat and drink and find enjoyment in all the toil with which one toils under the sun the few days of his life that God has given him, for this is his lot”* (5:18). That’s something. There’s beauty in living with gratitude, in doing your work and enjoying the simple things, all as a gift from God.

But the big question remains: If joy is the right way to live, where do we find it? Solomon doesn’t fully say—at least, not yet.

> [!important]+ Reflect and Respond
So we ask: Do you have joy? In your life, your work, your relationships? The Bible says that joy isn’t just a nice bonus—it’s what flows out of knowing Jesus. So pray today. Ask God to give you joy. Ask him to help you love Jesus more, so that even in the ordinary things—your chores, your job, your conversations—you would feel real joy, the kind that only comes from him.
