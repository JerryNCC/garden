### <center>抵挡敌意</center>

> [!info]- 🎙️Audio: [A Daily Devotional - 06.07 - CN]()

在世界许多地方，耶稣的跟随者因忠于圣经中的真神，常常面临反对，甚至生命的威胁。我们也应当坚定自己对基督和福音的委身，因为将来或许有一天，我们也会因信仰遭遇反对或逼迫。

尼希米召集了支持神呼召、同心重建城墙的人。他们勤奋劳作，然而反对的声音很快就出现了。还记得尼希米记第二章里的撒门巴列和托比雅吗？他们起初嘲笑尼希米和工人，说一只小狐狸都能推倒刚建成的耶路撒冷城墙。但嘲讽很快转变为严重的威胁。撒门巴列和托比雅联合其他恨恶神子民的人，密谋攻击尼希米和他的团队。

尼希米的回应为我们今天面对反对乃至将来可能的逼迫树立了榜样。首先，他祷告。在第四节，他呼求神“垂听”，求神将那些讥讽反转回他们自己头上。随着攻击的威胁日益临近，尼希米再一次祷告，求神保护那些工人和城墙。然而，祷告并非他唯一的行动。尼希米亲自承担起保护城市和人民的责任。重建工作继续，但现在有了守卫——持剑、矛、弓的士兵分布在城墙周围，警戒防守。

撒门巴列、托比雅及其同伙的攻击最终未曾发生。也许是因为耶路撒冷加强的防备让他们退却，我们不得而知。但我们确定的是，神信实地保护了尼希米和他的子民，保守了他们所蒙呼召完成的工事。故事继续在第四章展开，生动描绘了基督徒的生活：神的子民为他辛勤劳作，将他的恩典和救恩传扬出去，凭借神的能力推动他的国度，同时警醒防备罪恶和魔鬼的诡计。

> [!important]+ 反思与回应
你愿意委身帮助更多人认识并爱慕耶稣吗？当你全心投入神的工作时，你是否也警醒防备撒但对你心灵的攻击？在亲近神的话语时，别忘了为此祷告思考。

### <center>Building Opposition</center>

> [!question]+ Review
> 1. Why was Nehemiah deeply grieved about Jerusalem and its broken walls? What did he honestly tell the Persian king?
> 2. ⁠How did Nehemiah encourage the people of Jerusalem to join in rebuilding the wall? What specific steps did he take?
> 3. Why did Sanballat and Tobiah oppose Nehemiah and the returning exiles? How did their opposition affect Nehemiah’s mission?

📖 **Passage to read**: ==Nehemiah 04==

> [!info]- 🎙️Audio: [A Daily Devotional - 06.07 - EN]()  

In many places around the world, followers of Jesus face opposition—sometimes even threats to their very lives—because of their faithfulness to the God of the Bible. We too need to strengthen our commitment to Christ and the gospel, knowing that one day we might face similar opposition or persecution for believing in Him.

Nehemiah gathered men who supported God’s call to rebuild the wall. They worked diligently, but soon opposition arrived. Remember Sanballat and Tobiah from Nehemiah 2? They started by mocking Nehemiah and the workers, saying a little fox could topple the newly built walls of Jerusalem. But their mockery soon turned into a serious threat. Sanballat and Tobiah joined forces with others who hated God’s people, planning an attack against Nehemiah and his team.

Nehemiah’s response offers us a model for facing opposition today—and maybe even persecution in the future. First, he prayed. In verse 4, he asks God to “hear” and to “turn their insults back on them.” As the threat of attack grew, Nehemiah prayed again, asking God to protect the men and the wall. But prayer was not all he did. Nehemiah committed himself to guarding the city and its people. The work went on, but now with guards—men armed with swords, spears, and bows—standing watch and defending the city.

The attack from Sanballat, Tobiah, and their men never came. Perhaps the stronger security scared them off; we don’t know for sure. What we do know is that God was faithful to Nehemiah and his people. He protected the work they were called to do. As the story continues through chapter 4, it gives us a vivid picture of the Christian life: God’s people working hard for Him, sharing His blessing and salvation, advancing His kingdom by His power—while staying alert against sin and the devil’s tricks.

> [!important]+ Reflect and Respond
Are you committed to helping others know and love Jesus more? As you devote yourself to His work, are you on guard against Satan’s attacks on your heart and soul? Take time to pray about these things as you reflect on God’s Word.
