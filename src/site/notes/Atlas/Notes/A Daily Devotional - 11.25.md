### <center>敬虔的领袖</center>

> [!info]- 🎙️Audio: [None]()


圣经向我们讲述的是一则宏大的故事。起初，神创造世界，也照着自己的形象造人。随后，人类堕落在罪中。然而，神并没有丢弃他所造的世界。他呼召亚伯拉罕，与他立约，赐下大福的应许，要临到万族万民。神从亚伯拉罕的后裔兴起一个子民、一个国家、一个国度，并在大卫和所罗门时期达到巅峰。即便后来因罪恶，他们遭遇审判与被掳，神仍然信实不变，差遣先知提醒他们他的应许，并指向那将要来的弥赛亚。

直到耶稣基督亲自来到世上。祂的死与复活成为整个故事的转折点。复活之后，祂升天，应许将再临，并把自己的百姓——教会——留下来，在世上敬拜祂、在圣洁中成长，并将福音传到万邦。这便是提摩太前书和其他书信所处的背景。保罗正在栽培一位年轻同工——提摩太——教导他如何把神的教会治理得合乎主心意。那么，教会要如何在这使命上持守忠心、不偏不倚呢？保罗的答案很清楚：教会需要敬虔的长老。

这段经文并不是在描绘“完美无瑕的基督徒”。保罗深知，在天家以前，没有人能达到完全的圣洁。他在这里给提摩太描绘的，是属灵成熟、效法基督的品格，是那些要带领神百姓的人身上必须显明出来的生命特质。教会的领袖必须敬虔、忠诚，因为他们的品格会深刻影响全会众的方向与圣洁程度。因此，保罗描述合宜的监督，该是怎样的人：“无可指责，只作一个妇人的丈夫，有节制，自守，端正，乐意接待远人，善于教导；不因酒滋事，不打人，只要温和，不争竞，不贪财”（3:2–3）。这是一个极其尊贵、也极其严肃的呼召。

你有没有留意到，一处长老与执事资格的关键差异？就是长老必须“善于教导”。保罗在此所说“监督”的职分，似乎包含了我们今日所谓的“长老”和“牧师”；而“执事”则是另一个相关却有别的职分。对保罗来说，“长老／牧师”这类人，是在教会中以正直和敬虔的品格带领群羊，又能忠心而准确地将神的话教导给祂的百姓的人。

> [!important]+ 反思与回应
你自己也许并不是长老或执事。然而，这段经文同样向你说话。那位塑造教会领袖的圣灵，也在每一位信徒里面动工。在耶稣的帮助下，你同样可以在节制、温柔、乐意接待人等方面不断成长。今天就求神帮助你，在品格上更像基督，好叫你无论在教会中的哪一个位置，都能好好地服事祂的子民。

📖 **Passage to read**: ==1 Timothy 01:01-11==

> [!info]- 🎙️Audio: [None]()  

The Bible tells one great story. It begins with God creating the world and making human beings in his image. Then comes the tragedy: we fall into sin. Yet God does not abandon his world. He calls Abraham and makes him a promise—a promise of blessing that will reach all nations. From Abraham’s family, God forms a people, a nation, a kingdom that reaches its high point under David and Solomon. Even when that kingdom falls into sin, judgment, and exile, God stays faithful. He sends prophets to remind his people of his promises and to point ahead to the coming Messiah.

Then Jesus comes. His death and resurrection are the turning point of the whole story. After he rises, he ascends to heaven, promises to come again, and leaves his people—the church—to worship him, to grow in holiness, and to take the gospel to the world. That is the setting of 1 Timothy and the other letters. Paul is shaping and training a young man, Timothy, to help lead God’s church well. But how will the church stay focused and faithful in this mission? Paul’s answer is clear: godly elders are essential.

This passage is not a checklist for perfect people. Paul knows no believer will reach full holiness until glory. Instead, he gives Timothy a portrait of mature, Christlike character. This is what should be visible in the lives of those who lead God’s people. Church leaders must be trustworthy and godly, because their lives will influence the tone, direction, and holiness of the whole congregation. So Paul describes the kind of man who should serve as an overseer: “above reproach, the husband of one wife, sober-minded, self-controlled, respectable, hospitable, able to teach, not a drunkard, not violent but gentle, not quarrelsome, not a lover of money” (3:2–3). It is a serious and weighty calling.

There is one key difference between the list for elders and the list for deacons: elders must be able to teach. The role Paul is outlining under the word “overseer” seems to include what we would call both elders and pastors. Deacons belong to a distinct but related office. Elders and pastors belong together in one category: men who guide the church with integrity and godly character and who can handle the Scriptures faithfully, teaching God’s people what he has said.

> [!important]+ Reflect and Respond
You may not be an elder or a deacon. Still, this passage speaks to you. The same Spirit who shapes church leaders is at work in every believer. By Jesus’s help, you too can grow in self-control, gentleness, and hospitality. Ask God today to form this kind of character in you, so that wherever he has placed you in his church, you can serve his people well.
