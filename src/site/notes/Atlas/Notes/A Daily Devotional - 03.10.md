### <center>刚强壮胆</center>

> [!info]- 🎙️Audio: [A Daily Devotional - 03.10 - CN]()


圣经中最伟大的时刻——耶稣基督的生、死与复活——虽然仍遥不可及，但在此之前，神的子民故事中有许多重要的事件。而《约书亚记》第一章便是其中的关键时刻！摩西的去世提醒我们严肃的罪与审判，但这一章其余部分充满了激动人心的期待。神为祂的百姓兴起了一位新领袖，终于是他们进入应许之地的时刻。

神对约书亚的呼召包含了一个你或许听过很多次的名句：“你当刚强壮胆”（1:6, 9）。征服应许之地的挑战在过去四十年中并没有变得更轻松；那片土地依旧充满了坚固的城池和强大的敌军。约书亚必须刚强无畏，带领神的百姓进入那片土地。然而，请注意在这两个重复的命令——“刚强壮胆”之间，真正意味着什么。神呼召约书亚遵行律法。约书亚力量与勇气的核心，正是他对神话语的忠心和顺服。

约书亚迅速召集领袖们，带着一个期待已久的信息穿过以色列百姓：“预备起来；神要赐给我们祂应许的土地。”他如此急切地传递这个消息，表明他对神应许的信心。他迅速响应神的呼召，把对神话语的信心传递给所有百姓。

最后，在本章的最后几节中，我们看到另一个鼓舞人心的时刻。神的百姓以信心和忠诚回应了神所拣选的新领袖。他们承诺要像顺服摩西一样顺服约书亚。甚至他们在誓言的最后，用重复神对约书亚所说的话结束：“你当刚强壮胆”（1:18）。

> [!important]+ 反思与回应
在你学习约书亚时，让他的领导力指引你想到神的最终领袖——耶稣基督。正是耶稣，神对他说：“你是我的爱子，我喜悦你”（马可福音 1:11）。是耶稣召唤所有人跟随祂。正是基督的百姓，坚定地确认祂作为整个世界的救主、主宰和君王的呼召。

> [!question]+ Review
> 1. ⁠Why does Moses emphasize the relationship between Moses and God in Deuteronomy 1 and 34? How does his failure point us to God's grace?
> 2. How does Joshua's obedience and courage serve as an example of faith for the people? What can we learn from his leadership about following God?
> 3. How do the people respond to Joshua's leadership after Moses' death? What does their obedient attitude teach us about our faith today?

📖 **Passage to read**: ==Joshua 01==

> [!info]- 🎙️Audio: [A Daily Devotional - 03.10 - EN]()  


The grandest moment of the Bible—the life, death, and resurrection of Jesus—is still a long way off. But there are many important events along the way. Joshua 1 is one of those key moments! The death of Moses serves as a serious reminder of sin and judgment, but the rest of the chapter is full of excitement and anticipation. God is raising up a new leader for His people, and it’s finally time for them to enter the promised land.

God’s call to Joshua includes a well-known phrase you’ve likely heard many times: “Be strong and courageous” (1:6, 9). The challenge of taking the land hasn’t gotten any easier over the past forty years; it’s still filled with strong armies and walled cities. Joshua must be brave and unafraid as he leads God’s people into the land. But notice something important between those two repeated phrases in verses 6 and 9—what it truly means for Joshua to be strong and courageous. God calls Joshua to obey the law. The heart of Joshua’s strength and courage is his obedience to the word of God. 

Joshua quickly gathers his leaders and sends them to the Israelites with a long-awaited message: “Get ready to go; God is giving us the land He promised.” His urgency to share this message shows his faith in God’s promises. He responds to God’s call by spreading this confidence in God’s word to all the people.

Finally, in the last verses of the chapter, we see an encouraging moment. God’s people respond with faith and loyalty to this new leader. They promise to obey him, just as they obeyed Moses. They even end their pledge by repeating the words God spoke to Joshua: “Only be strong and courageous” (1:18).

> [!important]+ Reflect and Respond
As you learn about Joshua, let his leadership remind you of the ultimate leader, Jesus Christ. It is Jesus to whom God said, “You are my beloved Son; with you I am well pleased” (Mark 1:11). It is Jesus who calls all people to follow Him. And it is Christ’s people who affirm His call as Savior, Lord, and King of the world.
