### <center>基督的心意</center>

> [!info]- 🎙️Audio: [None]()


如今，尤其是在美国，人们常常只谈论耶稣的一个方面：他的榜样。即便是无神论者，也会称他为一位谦卑的人——他受苦、医治病人、以非凡的方式爱人。基督徒知道，耶稣远不止于一个榜样，但我们也必须承认，他绝不是少于这一点。他是我们的君王、救主和主，但他同时也是谦卑服事、以他人为先、甘愿受苦的完美榜样。保罗在腓立比书 2:1–11 中正是要教导我们这一点。

腓立比的教会正面临一个严重的问题：分裂与争斗。稍后保罗还会点名两位制造纷争的人——你可以想象当教会听到这封信被读出时，他们的脸会有多么通红！保罗的呼吁很明确：“若在基督里有什么安慰、爱心有什么共鸣、圣灵有什么交通、心中有什么慈悲怜悯，你们就要意念相同，爱心相同，有一样的心思，有一样的意念。凡事不可出于私心或虚荣，而要存心谦卑，各人看别人比自己强。”（2:2–3）他希望这场纷争结束。福音里的百姓必须在基督里合一，必须把他人的需要放在自己的需要之上。那么，他们应如何做到呢？

保罗指向耶稣基督——他们的救主——作为终极的榜样。从第 5 节起，他描述了耶稣从神的右边降世为人的奇异过程。但这只是谦卑的开始。耶稣“既有人的样式，就自甘卑微，顺服至死，且死在十字架上。”（2:8）耶稣本有权利永远掌权、享受荣耀，但他选择谦卑自己，为了拯救罪人甘愿受死。因此，保罗写道，耶稣必永远被高举，万膝必跪，万口必承认他为主。这，就是基督的心意——也是腓立比信徒得以合一的关键。

> [!important]+ 反思与回应
祷告吧，求主让你有基督的心意，与弟兄姊妹相处。祷告吧，因福音的缘故，你能以他人为念，就如耶稣为你的永恒益处甘愿牺牲一样。

### <center>The Mind of Christ</center>

📖 **Passage to read**: ==Philippians 02:01-11==

> [!info]- 🎙️Audio: [None]()  

Today, many people, especially in the U.S., are comfortable speaking about one side of Jesus: his example. Even those who do not believe in God can point to him as a humble man who suffered, healed others, and loved people in remarkable ways. Christians know that Jesus is far more than an example, but we should also recognize that he is not less than this. He is our King, Savior, and Lord—but he is also the perfect example of humble service, of putting others first, even in suffering. Paul makes this clear in Philippians 2:1–11.

The church in Philippi was struggling with a serious problem: disunity and conflict. Later in the letter, Paul names two of the people causing trouble—you can imagine their faces when the church heard the reading! Paul’s message is clear: “Complete my joy by being of the same mind, having the same love, being in full accord and of one mind. Do nothing from selfish ambition or conceit, but in humility count others more significant than yourselves” (2:2–3). He wants the fighting to end. Christians must be united in Christ. They must put the needs of others above their own. But how can they do this?

Paul points them to Jesus Christ, their Savior, as the ultimate example. In verse 5, he describes the astonishing way Jesus left his position at the right hand of God to become a human being. This was only the beginning of his humility. Jesus “humbled himself by becoming obedient to the point of death, even death on a cross” (2:8). Though he had the right to live in glory forever as God, he chose to humble himself to save sinners. And because of this, Paul writes, Jesus will be exalted forever. Every knee will bow, and every tongue will confess that he is Lord. This is the mind of Christ—and it is the key to unity among believers.

> [!important]+ Reflect and Respond
Pray that you would share this mind of Christ as you relate to others. Pray that, because of the gospel, you would look to the needs of others, just as Jesus looked to your eternal needs when he gave his life for you.
