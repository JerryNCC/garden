### <center>《认识以斯拉》</center>

> [!info]- 🎙️Audio: [A Daily Devotional - 06.02 - CN]()

以斯拉记第七章及其后的事件，发生在圣殿奠基后的五十七年——也就是我们上一章所读到的那座圣殿。如今，圣殿已经重建，逾越节也再次被守住，百姓已经回归故土。而现在，是时候来认识以斯拉了。

关于以斯拉，最重要的一件事，是他是一位祭司。而且不仅仅是普通的祭司，他的家谱可以一直追溯到亚伦——摩西的哥哥，也是第一位大祭司。圣经描述他是“精通耶和华诫命的文士”（7:6），但他不仅仅是个有学问的人——经文还说，“耶和华他神的手帮助他”（7:6）。这是个关键的信息：以斯拉不仅懂律法，更是有神同在的人。

第十节又告诉我们，以斯拉“定志考究遵行耶和华的律法，又将律例典章教训以色列人”。他不仅研究神的话，更立志践行，而且教导别人也如此行。他不只是个学者，他是个行道者，也是个传道者。如今，神的百姓重回故土，有了圣殿，也有了同样重要的一样事物：一个熟悉神话语、热爱神话语，并能引导他们敬拜与侍奉的属灵领袖。

我们再次看到，神借着一位外邦君王成就祂的计划。这一次，是波斯王亚达薛西。他差遣以斯拉回到犹大地，还允许所有被掳之民一同回归。这显然是出于神的手，祂使王的心向以斯拉施恩，也带领祂的百姓再度归回。我们再一次被提醒：神并没有放弃祂的百姓！

继续阅读以斯拉的生平与领导时，请留心他内心的动力：对神和祂话语的爱。他热切渴望百姓以正确的方式敬拜神。在这点上，以斯拉为我们指向那位更伟大的祭司——神的道将要成为肉身，降临人间；祂要借着自己在十字架上的牺牲，为百姓开出敬拜的道路，成就真正的敬拜。

> [!important]+ 反思与回应
所以，现在是一个值得反思的时候：别人是否会说，你“立志考究”神的话语，甘愿遵行，并乐意向人传讲？今天就向神祷告，求祂赐你这样专注与火热的心，使你更加渴望认识并遵行祂的话，好叫你能向人传扬耶稣基督的恩典与爱。

### <center>Meet Ezra</center>

> [!question]+ Review
> 1. ⁠Why did the Israelites begin observing the festivals and offering sacrifices even before the temple was rebuilt? What does this show about their spiritual renewal?
> 2. ⁠Why did the older generation weep when the foundation of the new temple was laid? What does this say about their feelings toward the past glory?
> 3. How does this passage point us to the truth that real hope is not in an earthly temple, but in a greater Savior?

📖 **Passage to read**: ==Ezra 07==

> [!info]- 🎙️Audio: [A Daily Devotional - 06.02 - EN]()  

The events of Ezra 7 and what follows take place fifty-seven years after the temple’s foundation was laid—the same temple we read about last time. It’s now been rebuilt. The Passover has been celebrated again. The people are back in the land. And now, it’s time to meet Ezra.

What’s the most important thing to know about Ezra? He’s a priest. And not just any priest—his family line goes all the way back to Aaron, Moses’ brother and the first high priest. Ezra is also described as someone “skilled in the Law of Moses” (7:6). But more than just being skilled, we’re told that “the hand of the Lord his God was on him” (7:6). That’s important. Ezra wasn’t just a good teacher—God was with him.

In verse 10, we read something else: Ezra had “set his heart to study the Law of the Lord, and to do it and to teach his statutes and rules in Israel.” He wasn’t just a student of Scripture—he lived it out. And he didn’t stop there—he also taught it to others. God’s people were back in the land. They had the temple again. And now they had something just as important: a leader who knew God’s word, loved it, and could help them walk in it.

Once again, we see God working through a foreign king. This time, it’s Artaxerxes of Persia. He sends Ezra back to Judah and even gives permission for any exiled Jew to return with him. Clearly, this is God’s doing. He’s giving Ezra favor with the king, and he’s bringing his people home again. Once more, we’re reminded—God hasn’t given up on his people.

As you keep reading about Ezra’s life and leadership, notice what drives him: a love for God and his word. He’s deeply concerned about worshiping God the right way. And in that, Ezra points us forward—to someone greater. A better priest is coming. One who is God’s Word in the flesh. One who will make true worship possible by giving himself for our sin on the cross.

> [!important]+ Reflect and Respond
So here’s a question worth asking: would someone say that you’ve “set your heart” on studying God’s word, living it, and sharing it with others? Ask God to help you grow in this kind of love and commitment. Pray that you would give yourself more fully to knowing and obeying his word, so you can share with others the good news of Jesus Christ.
