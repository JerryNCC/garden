### <center>脱离罪恶，差遣服事</center>

> [!info]- 🎙️Audio: [A Daily Devotional - 07.28 - CN]()

在圣经中我们不断看见一个事实：上帝并不需要人来成就祂的计划。祂是神，祂能成就万事。然而，尽管祂无所不能，祂却乐意使用人，尤其是那些信靠祂、爱祂、承认祂为主的人。

《以赛亚书》第六章向我们展示了这幅图画。先知以赛亚看见一幅异象——上帝坐在高高的宝座上，满有荣耀。天使围绕着祂，不断呼喊：“圣哉，圣哉，圣哉！”整个殿宇震动，烟云充满其间。真正的属灵经历，总是从我们看见上帝的圣洁与荣耀开始。

以赛亚的回应十分真实：他喊着说：“祸哉，我灭亡了！”他知道自己是个罪人，嘴唇不洁，不配站在圣洁的上帝面前。当我们真正明白神的圣洁时，我们也会认清自己的污秽与败坏。我们的罪使我们与神隔绝，且我们无法靠自己修补这断裂。

但就在这时，转机出现了。一位天使从祭坛上取了一块烧着的炭，将它触在以赛亚的嘴唇上，说：“你的罪孽除掉了。”这是一幅洁净的画面，预表神的怜悯与赦罪。神亲自洁净罪人，使他们焕然一新。这正是耶稣为我们所做的：除去我们的罪，使我们得以成为新造的人。

然而，很多人对救恩的认识常常止步于此——只停留在“被赦免”。但以赛亚的经历并未止于赦罪。神接着发出呼召：“我可以差遣谁呢？”这时，以赛亚毫不犹豫地回应：“我在这里，请差遣我！”真正的救恩，不只是使人得赦免，更是差遣人去为祂而活。

这不仅是以赛亚的故事，也是每一个基督徒的召命。如果我们是属耶稣的，祂已洁净我们的罪，并差遣我们进到祂的工场中。我们蒙召去使人认识祂、敬拜祂。

> [!important]+ 反思与回应
所以今天，就向神祷告吧：愿祂帮助你正确回应祂的恩典，不只是接受，更是愿意被差遣，走进祂为你预备的使命中。投身在祂的工作中，为祂而活。

### <center>Saved from Sin and Sent to Serve</center>

> [!question]+ Review
> 1. ⁠Why does Isaiah use the image of a vineyard to describe God’s people? What message does this picture convey?
> 2. What does God's reaction to the vineyard’s failure to produce good fruit reveal about his character and expectations?
> 3. As God’s people today, how should we respond to his call to grow and bear fruit in Christ?

📖 **Passage to read**: ==Isaiah 06==

> [!info]- 🎙️Audio: [A Daily Devotional - 07.28 - EN]()  

One thing we see again and again in the Bible is that God doesn’t need people to carry out his plans. He’s God—he can do anything. But even though he doesn’t need us, he chooses to use us. And not just anyone—he loves to work through people who trust him, love him, and call him their Lord.

This is what we see in Isaiah 6. Isaiah has a vision of God—seated on a high throne, full of glory. Angels are around him, crying out that he is holy, holy, holy. The whole scene is shaking, filled with smoke. That’s where it begins. A real encounter with God always starts with seeing who he truly is—holy, perfect, and full of glory.

Isaiah’s response is exactly what you’d expect from someone who sees God like that. He says, “Woe is me! I am lost!” He knows he’s a sinner. His lips are unclean. He’s not worthy to stand before God. When we see God’s holiness, we see how far away from him we really are. Our sin separates us from him, and we can’t fix that on our own.

But then something happens. One of the angels flies toward Isaiah with a burning coal from the altar. He touches Isaiah’s lips and says, “Your guilt is taken away.” It’s a picture of God’s mercy. God is the one who makes us clean. That’s what he does for us through Jesus—he takes away our guilt and makes us new.

This is where many of us tend to stop. We think salvation ends with being forgiven. But it doesn’t. After Isaiah is cleansed, God speaks: “Whom shall I send?” Isaiah answers right away: “Here I am! Send me.” That’s what salvation leads to. God saves us, and then he sends us. We’re not just forgiven—we’re called to join his work.

That was true for Isaiah, and it’s true for us too. If we belong to Jesus, we’ve been cleansed from our sin, and we’ve been given a mission. We are sent out to help others know and worship him.

> [!important]+ Reflect and Respond
So today, ask God to help you respond to his grace—not just by receiving it, but by stepping into the life he’s calling you to live. Join him in what he’s doing in the world.
