### <center>面对后果</center>

> [!info]- 🎙️Audio: [A Daily Devotional - 04.25 - CN]()

神确实赦免了大卫的罪。然而，当我们阅读撒母耳记下第十三章时，我们会发现一个重要的真理：尽管神立即赦免罪，罪的影响却可能持续一生。大卫与拔示巴的罪——神所赦免的罪——最终给他的家庭带来了可怕的后果。罪总会留下痛苦与破碎，即便罪人已经悔改并蒙神赦免。

拿单曾经警告过大卫。在撒母耳记下第十二章，神宣布作为惩罚，大卫的孩子将会死去。但拿单还告诉了他另一件事：“这是耶和华所说的：‘我必从你家中兴起灾祸攻击你’”（12:11）。撒母耳记下第十三章便是这句话的悲惨应验。大卫的儿子暗嫩对他的同父异母的妹妹他玛生出淫念。在狡猾的朋友约拿达的帮助下，他假装生病，把她骗到房间里。当她来照顾他时，他竟强暴了她，随后立刻厌弃她，将她赶走，使她蒙羞。

悲剧并未就此结束。他玛的亲哥哥押沙龙对暗嫩的恶行充满愤怒。但他并未选择以敬虔的方式伸张正义，而是等待时机复仇。两年后，在积累了两年的仇恨与苦毒后，押沙龙终于逮到机会。他说服父亲派暗嫩前往乡间放羊，然后让暗嫩喝醉，随即命仆人将其杀害。

淫欲、强暴、仇恨、复仇、谋杀——所有这些罪恶都发生在大卫的家中，而这仅仅是其中一个章节！罪的影响远超我们的想象。神的赦免并不会抹去罪在今生带来的伤害。大卫虽然蒙赦免，但他的罪行给家庭带来的痛苦却无法逆转。

> [!important]+ 反思与回应
今天，花些时间向神承认你的罪，相信因着耶稣在十字架上的牺牲，你已经完全被赦免。坦诚地向神倾诉你的挣扎——祂的恩典足够支撑你。当你今天努力跟随基督时，要记住，罪从来都不仅仅是个人的问题，它总会在不知不觉中影响他人。愿这个事实，以及你对基督的爱，激励你活出圣洁的生命！

### <center>:Facing Consequences</center>

> [!question]+ Review
> 1.  ⁠How did Nathan warn David in 2 Samuel 12 about the consequences of his sin?  
> 2. ⁠What terrible events happened in David’s family as described in 2 Samuel 13? How did these events fulfill Nathan’s prophecy?  
> 3. Even though David was forgiven by God, his sins still affected his family. How does this truth remind us about the consequences of sin?

📖 **Passage to read**: ==2 Samuel 13==

> [!info]- 🎙️Audio: [A Daily Devotional - 04.25 - EN]()  

God truly forgave David for his sin. But when we look at the events in 2 Samuel 13, we see an important truth: even though God forgives sin immediately, the effects of sin can last a lifetime. David’s sin with Bathsheba—the very sin God forgave—led to terrible consequences in his own family. Sin always leaves behind pain and brokenness, even for those who repent and are forgiven by God.

Nathan had warned David about this. In 2 Samuel 12, God declared that David’s child would die as part of his punishment. But Nathan also told him something else: "This is what the Lord says: ‘I am going to bring disaster on you from your own household’" (12:11). What follows in 2 Samuel 13 is the tragic fulfillment of those words. One of David’s sons, Amnon, becomes obsessed with his half-sister Tamar. With the help of his cunning friend Jonadab, he tricks her into coming to his room by pretending to be sick. Then, in a terrible act of wickedness, he rapes her and immediately rejects her, sending her away in shame.

The tragedy continues. Tamar’s brother Absalom is filled with anger at what Amnon has done. But instead of seeking justice in a godly way, he waits for the perfect moment to get revenge. Two years later—after two years of hatred and bitterness—Absalom finally seizes his chance. He persuades his father to send Amnon to the countryside, where he gets him drunk and then has his servants kill him.

Lust, rape, hatred, revenge, murder. All of this happened in David’s own family—and this is just one chapter! Sin always spreads farther than we expect. God’s forgiveness does not erase the damage our sins can cause in this life. David was forgiven, but the pain his actions brought upon his family could not be undone.

> [!important]+ Reflect and Respond
Take some time today to confess your sins to God. Trust that through Jesus’ death on the cross, you are completely forgiven. Be honest with God about your struggles—His grace is more than enough for you. And as you seek to follow Christ today, remember that sin is never just a personal issue. It always affects others in ways we may not realize. Let this truth, along with your love for Christ, lead you to walk in holiness today.
