**Verse 1:**
As little children we would dream of Christmas morn  
And all the gifts and toys we knew we’d find  
But we never realized a baby born one blessed night  
Gave us the greatest gift of our lives  

**Chorus:**
We are the reason that he gave His life  
We are the reason that He suffered and died  
To a world that was lost He gave all He could give  
To show us the reason to live  

**Verse 2:**
As the years went by we learned more about gifts  
Giving of ourselves and what that means  
On a dark and cloudy day a man hung crying in the rain  
Because of love  
Because of love  

**Chorus:**
We are the reason that he gave His life  
We are the reason that He suffered and died  
To a world that was lost He gave all He could give  
To show us the reason to live  

**Bridge**
I finally found the reason for living  
It’s in giving every part of my heart to Him  
In all that I do, every word that I say  
I’ll be giving my all just for Him, for Him  

**Chorus:**
We are the reason that he gave His life  
We are the reason that He suffered and died  
To a world that was lost He gave all He could give  
To show us the reason to live  
He is my reason to live
