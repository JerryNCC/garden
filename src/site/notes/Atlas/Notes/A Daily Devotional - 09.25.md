四百年来，神一直沉默，无先知，无新启示。但如今，这静默被打破，神再次动工。祂的应许开始成就——先是施洗约翰的降临，如今是所应许的弥赛亚耶稣基督。

路加告诉我们，天使加百列来到一位名叫马利亚的少女那里，她已经许配给约瑟。加百列带来极其惊人的信息：“你要怀孕生子，可以给他起名叫耶稣。他要为大，称为至高者的儿子。”（1:31–32）试想这一刻，一个少女竟被告知她要怀上神的儿子。当马利亚询问这如何成就时，天使的回答更是奇妙：“圣灵要临到你身上，至高者的能力要荫庇你，因此所要生的圣者，必称为神的儿子。”（1:35）答案简单却深奥——这孩子的诞生是神亲自成就的神迹。

马利亚的回应令人敬佩。她说：“我是主的使女，情愿照你的话成就在我身上。”（1:38）她以安静的信心将自己交托给神：“主啊，无论你说什么，我都愿顺服。”祭司撒迦利亚面对较小的应许尚且难以相信，但马利亚却信靠神必成就这看似不可能的事。

然而，她的信心并非盲目。马利亚探访亲戚以利沙伯，以利沙伯腹中的婴孩因感受到神儿子的同在就跳动起来。随后，马利亚唱出她的尊主颂，这首诗歌充满圣经话语和神的应许。她的心因认识神的话并相信祂的计划而欢喜。

你是否愿意顺服神的话语和祂在你生命中的旨意？让马利亚的祷告成为你的祷告。求神使你成为祂的仆人，在生命的每一个层面按着祂的话语而活。

> [!question]+ Review
> 1.⁠ ⁠What was Luke’s purpose in writing his Gospel, and what assurance did he want Theophilus and the readers to have?
2.⁠ ⁠What message did the angel deliver to Zechariah while he was serving in the temple?
3.⁠ ⁠Why was Zechariah struck mute, and how does this event show that God’s plan is not hindered by human doubt?

📖 **Passage to read**: ==Luke 01.26-56==

> [!info]- 🎙️Audio: [None]()  

For four hundred years, God had been silent. No prophets, no new words. But now the quiet is broken. God is moving again. His promises are starting to unfold—first with the coming of John the Baptist, and now with the promised Messiah, Jesus Christ.

Luke tells us that the angel Gabriel visits a young girl named Mary, who is engaged to Joseph. Gabriel brings an astonishing message: “You will conceive and give birth to a son, and you shall call his name Jesus. He will be great and will be called the Son of the Most High” (1:31–32). Imagine this moment. A teenage girl is told she will carry the Son of God. When Mary asks how this could happen, the angel gives an even greater surprise: “The Holy Spirit will come upon you, and the power of the Most High will overshadow you; therefore the child to be born will be called holy—the Son of God” (1:35). The answer is simple and profound. This birth will be a miracle, made possible by God himself.

Mary’s reply is remarkable. She says, “Behold, I am the servant of the Lord; let it be to me according to your word” (1:38). With quiet faith, she places her life in God’s hands. “Whatever you say, Lord, I will follow.” Zechariah the priest had struggled to believe a lesser promise, but Mary trusts God to do what seems impossible.

Her faith is not blind. Mary visits her relative Elizabeth, and the baby in Elizabeth’s womb leaps at the presence of the Son of God. Mary then sings her Magnificat, a song filled with Scripture and the promises of God. Her heart rejoices because she knows God’s word and believes his plan.

> [!important]+ Reflect and Respond
Will you submit to God’s word and will in your life? Let Mary’s prayer be your own. Ask God to make you his servant, ready to live according to his word in every part of your life.
