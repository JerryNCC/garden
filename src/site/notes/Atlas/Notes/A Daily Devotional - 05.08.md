### <center>万国的祝福</center>

> [!info]- 🎙️Audio: [A Daily Devotional - 05.08 - CN]()

如果说旧约中有一个高峰，那个以色列历史的巅峰时刻，那么它就出现在《列王纪上》第十章。这段经文标志着以色列君主制的高潮，是神对亚伯拉罕应许的极致体现——至少在人类的视角来看。神对亚伯拉罕的应许是关于祝福的——不仅是对他家族的祝福，也是对地上万国的祝福。

随着所罗门王国在财富、权力和影响力上的增长，所罗门的名声也逐渐传播开来。最终，示巴女王听闻了所罗门非凡的财富与智慧，决定踏上漫长的旅程前去拜访他。她带着复杂的问题而来，准备挑战这位以色列王。她还带来了丰厚的礼物——“香料、极多的金子和宝石”（10:2）。

看来，女王希望测试所罗门的智慧。她向他提出了各种问题，准备进行一次真正的挑战。然而令她惊讶的是，所罗门回答了她所有的问题；没有任何问题是他无法解释的（10:3）。接着，经文告诉我们，在与所罗门交谈并见识了他所有的财富、仆人和珍宝后，“她就气喘吁吁”了（10:5）。

我们无法知道女王对所罗门的祝福是否反映了她个人对以色列神的信仰，但她的祝福语依然美丽地概括了神通过所罗门和他的百姓所赐予的祝福：“你的臣子有福了！常常站在你面前听你智慧话语的仆人有福了！愿耶和华你的神得以称颂，他喜悦你，立你作以色列的王”（10:8-9）。所罗门和神的百姓已经达到了他们的巅峰，连示巴女王也意识到了这一点，并因而被祝福。神已在他的治理下建立了他的百姓，以至于连远方的君王都前来见证并接受神的伟大祝福。

> [!important]+ 反思与回应
神的国度——通过他儿子的死和复活建立的——是一个充满祝福的国度，一个吸引并祝福各国人民的国度。来自各族各方各国的人都被邀请来归向耶稣，真王，通过他体验救恩和祝福。《列王纪上》第十章是对未来的预兆。祈求神开你的眼睛，让你看见他真实的国度——耶稣的国度。

### <center>Blessing to All the Nations</center>

> [!question]+ Review
> 1. ⁠What understanding of the temple does Solomon express in his prayer in 1 Kings 8? Why does he believe that the temple cannot contain the God of the universe?
> 2. Solomon’s prayer mentions God's grace and mercy. How does this passage reflect God’s tolerance and acceptance of sinners who repent?
> 3. How do you understand the symbolic role of the “temple” mentioned in 1 Kings 8? In today’s faith life, how can we avoid over-relying on material or external “temples”?

📖 **Passage to read**: ==1 Kings 10:01-13==

> [!info]- 🎙️Audio: [A Daily Devotional - 05.08 - EN]()  

If there’s a high point in the Old Testament, a moment where the story of Israel reaches its peak, it’s found in 1 Kings 10. This passage marks the climax of Israel's monarchy, the pinnacle of the fulfillment of God’s promise to Abraham—at least from a human perspective. God’s promise to Abraham was about blessing, not just for his family, but for all the nations of the earth.

As Solomon’s kingdom grew in wealth, power, and influence, his reputation spread far and wide. Eventually, the Queen of Sheba hears about Solomon’s extraordinary wealth and wisdom, and she decides to take a long journey to visit him. She arrives prepared with tough questions, intending to challenge the king. But she also brings generous gifts—“spices and very much gold and precious stones” (10:2).

It seems the queen wanted to test Solomon’s wisdom. She asks him all sorts of questions, prepared for a real challenge. To her astonishment, Solomon answers every question she asks; there is nothing that escapes his understanding, and he explains everything to her (10:3). The passage then tells us that after talking with Solomon and seeing his wealth, servants, and treasures, “there was no more breath in her” (10:5).

We don’t know if the queen’s words of blessing for Solomon reflect personal faith in the God of Israel, but they still beautifully capture the essence of the blessings God has poured out on Solomon and his people: “Happy are your men! Happy are your servants, who continually stand before you and hear your wisdom! Blessed be the LORD your God, who has delighted in you and set you on the throne of Israel” (10:8–9). Solomon and God’s people have reached their height, and even the Queen of Sheba recognizes it and is blessed by it. God has established his people under his rule, so much so that even distant rulers come to witness and receive the great blessing of God.

> [!important]+ Reflect and Respond
The kingdom of God—established through the death and resurrection of his Son—is a kingdom full of blessing, one that draws people from every corner of the earth. People from all nations, tribes, and tongues are invited to come to Jesus, the true King, to experience salvation and blessing through him. 1 Kings 10 is a glimpse of what is to come. Pray that God would open your eyes to see his true kingdom—Jesus’s kingdom.
