### <center>雅各——作梦者  </center>

> [!info]- 🎙️Audio: [A Daily Devotional - 01.21 - CN]()

创世记第28章展现了雅各和以扫这两位兄弟之间鲜明的对比。雅各被神拣选为承载祂应许的人，他离开家乡，到亲族中寻找妻子。而以扫则随自己的欲望行事，再次娶妻，这次是选择了以实玛利的后代。这显然是他为了赢得父亲的喜爱，甚至是为了与雅各抗衡而做出的笨拙尝试。

在第10节中，我们看到雅各孤身一人踏上前往哈兰的旅程。夜幕降临，他不得不停下来休息。周围一片荒凉，他只能用一块石头当枕头躺下入睡。在这个寂静而荒芜的地方，神在梦中向雅各显现。雅各梦见一架梯子从地上通到天上，天使在梯子上来回攀爬。这一异象究竟有什么含义呢？

这梯子似乎象征着天与地之间的联系。通过这个梦，神向雅各显示，祂是那位主动迈出第一步接近人类的神。这一时刻提醒我们，神一贯的方式是不变的：祂亲近祂的子民。正如祂曾对亚伯拉罕许下应许，如今祂直接对雅各说话，重申了这些应许。在这旷野之中，神向雅各保证：“我必不离弃你，直到我成就了我所应许的”（28:15）。

雅各的回应值得我们深思。首先，他因神的同在与话语而惊叹；其次，他承认神的伟大与临近；最后，雅各开始敬拜。他立石为柱，许下誓言，甚至承诺将所得的一成献给神。这是雅各生命中的一个转折点——从一个为自己而活的人，转变为以信心回应神的人。

> [!important]+ 反思与回应
当你默想这个故事时，不妨思考自己如何回应神的应许与信实。你是否因祂的临近而感到惊奇？是否在生活的每个领域中都花时间敬拜祂？像雅各一样，让我们以信心回应神的信实，将祂的同在带入我们每天的生活中。

### <center>Jacob the Dreamer</center>

> [!question]+ Review
> 1. How did Jacob deceive Isaac to receive the blessing meant for Esau?
> 2. Why does God still choose people like Jacob to fulfill His plans?
> 3. How does Romans 5:8 demonstrate God’s love and faithfulness toward sinners?

📖 **Passage to read**: ==Genesis 28==

> [!info]- 🎙️Audio: [A Daily Devotional - 01.21 - EN]()

Chapter 28 of Genesis shows us a striking contrast between Jacob and Esau, two very different brothers. Jacob, chosen by God to carry His promise, leaves home to find a wife among his own people. Esau, driven by his own desires, marries again, this time choosing someone from Ishmael’s family. It’s a clumsy attempt to gain his father’s approval and perhaps rival Jacob.

In verse 10, we find Jacob on a lonely journey toward Haran. Night falls, and he has to stop to rest. With nothing else around, he uses a stone as a pillow and lies down to sleep. In this quiet and desolate place, God comes to Jacob in a dream. Jacob sees a ladder reaching from earth to heaven, with angels moving up and down. What does this vision mean?

The ladder seems to represent a connection between heaven and earth. Through this dream, God shows Jacob that He is the one who takes the first step to reach out to humanity. This moment reminds us of God’s unchanging pattern: He draws near to His people. Just as He made promises to Abraham, God now speaks directly to Jacob, affirming those same promises. In this wilderness moment, God assures Jacob, “I will not leave you until I have done what I promised” (28:15).

Jacob’s response is worth noting. First, he is awestruck by God’s presence and words. Then, he recognizes God’s power and nearness. Finally, Jacob begins to worship. He sets up a stone as an altar, makes vows, and even promises to give God a tenth of all he receives. This is a turning point for Jacob. A man who once lived for himself is now responding to God in faith.

> [!important]+ Reflect and Respond
As you reflect on this story, consider how you respond to God’s promises and faithfulness in your life. Are you amazed that He comes near to you? Do you take time to worship Him in every part of your life? Like Jacob, let’s respond to God’s faithfulness with faith of our own, carrying His presence into our day.
