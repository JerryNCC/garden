### <center>上帝的掌控与人的选择</center>

> [!info]- 🎙️Audio: [A Daily Devotional - 02.03 - CN]()
  

在《出埃及记》第4至5章中，上帝差遣摩西和亚伦去见法老，要求他释放以色列人。然而，这次会面并不顺利。法老不仅拒绝了他们的请求，还让以色列人的生活变得更加艰难，强迫他们自己去收集制作砖块所需的稻草。摩西和亚伦对此感到心灰意冷，转而向上帝求助。在《出埃及记》第6章中，上帝再次向他们保证，他会拯救他的子民，并差遣他们回到法老面前，这次带着彰显上帝大能的神迹。  

《出埃及记》第7章记录了一场非凡的对决：摩西和亚伦与埃及的术士们交锋。这些术士凭借邪术竟能模仿一些神迹，比如将杖变成蛇，甚至复制了第一个灾难：将水变为血。这些术士的能力很可能来源于撒但，显示出邪恶势力在这个世界上确实存在。然而，他们的力量终究无法与真神的权能抗衡。随着故事的发展，我们清楚地看到撒但的力量是有限的，最终无法阻挡上帝的主权计划。  

本章的一个关键主题是上帝对事件的绝对掌控与法老个人决定之间的关系。在第3节中，上帝说：“我要使法老的心刚硬。”在第4节中，上帝告诉摩西和亚伦：“法老必不听你们的话。”而在第13节、第14节和第22节中，圣经则简单地陈述法老的心刚硬。上帝的主权与法老的选择并存，且毫无矛盾。上帝正在成就他完美的计划，而法老则要为自己拒绝上帝的决定承担责任。  

> [!important]+ 反思与回应
这种互动提醒我们，上帝掌管万事。他的计划永不会被阻止，他的旨意必然成就。同时，我们也被呼召以谦卑和顺服来回应他。不要像法老那样刚硬自己的心。相反，要感谢上帝的恩典，因他拣选了我们成为他的子民。今日，请聆听他的话语，预备好遵行他的呼召。

### <center>God’s Control and Human Choice</center>

📖 **Passage to read**: ==Exodus 07==

> [!info]- 🎙️Audio: [A Daily Devotional - 02.03 - EN]()

In Exodus 4–5, God sent Moses and Aaron to speak to Pharaoh, asking him to let the Israelites go. The meeting didn’t go as planned. Pharaoh refused their request and made life even harder for the Israelites, forcing them to gather their own straw for making bricks. Moses and Aaron, disheartened by the worsening situation, turned to God for help. In Exodus 6, God reassured them with his promise to deliver his people and sent them back to Pharaoh, this time with powerful signs to perform.  

Exodus 7 describes an extraordinary showdown between Moses and Aaron and the magicians of Egypt. Using their dark arts, the magicians managed to mimic some of the signs, turning staffs into serpents and even replicating the first plague: turning water into blood. These magicians, likely drawing their power from Satan, showed that demonic forces can exert real influence. But they were no match for the power of the true God. As the story continues, it becomes clear that Satan’s power is limited and ultimately cannot stand against God’s sovereign will.  

One key theme in this chapter is the interaction between God’s absolute control over events and Pharaoh’s own decisions. In verse 3, God says, “I will harden Pharaoh’s heart.” In verse 4, God tells Moses and Aaron, “Pharaoh will not listen to you.” Then, in verses 13, 14, and 22, the text states that Pharaoh’s heart was hardened. Both God’s sovereignty and Pharaoh’s choices are presented side by side without contradiction. God is working out his perfect plan, yet Pharaoh is fully responsible for his decision to resist God.  

> [!important]+ Reflect and Respond
This interplay reminds us that God is in control of all things. His plans cannot be stopped, and his purposes will always come to pass. At the same time, we are called to respond to him with humility and obedience. Don’t harden your heart like Pharaoh did. Instead, thank God for his grace in choosing you as his own. Be attentive to his word and ready to obey his call today.
