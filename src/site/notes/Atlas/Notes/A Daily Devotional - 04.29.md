### <center>主是我的磐石</center>

> [!info]- 🎙️Audio: [A Daily Devotional - 04.29 - CN]()

许多运动队在夺得胜利后，都会高唱皇后乐队（Queen）的歌曲 We Are the Champions 以示庆祝。如果大卫王也有一首胜利之歌，那它必然截然不同。在《撒母耳记下》的这段记载中，大卫已然成为当时地区最强大的统治者。他的国度完全在掌控之中，扫罗的家族和其他王位竞争者都已不复存在。非利士人和其他敌对民族也已被他和军队击败。然而，大卫并未炫耀自己的能力，而是用一首诗歌赞美耶和华，将一切荣耀归于神，因为他深知，自己的成功完全出于神的恩典。

大卫的诗歌以一段充满力量的宣告开篇：

“耶和华是我的磐石，我的山寨，我的救主，
我的神，我的磐石，我所投靠的，
祂是我的盾牌，是拯救我的角，
是我的高台，是我的避难所，
我的救主啊，你是那救我脱离强暴的。”（撒下 22:2-3）

对大卫而言，神才是他真正的力量源泉，祂是他的防护者、拯救者，救他脱离一切危险。

大卫也明白，神的伟大权能主宰着他人生的每一个瞬间。在第 8-16 节中，大卫用充满气势的诗意语言描绘了神的显现：“祂使天下垂，亲自降临”，“耶和华从天上打雷”（撒下 22:10,14）。大卫看到神亲自为他争战，他深知，自己所获得的每一场胜利，都是神大能的手所赐。

随后，大卫说出了一句看似带有自夸之意的话：

“耶和华按着我的公义待我，
按着我手中的清洁赏赐我。”（撒下 22:21）

这是否意味着大卫自认为完美无瑕呢？当然不是！我们知道他曾犯下严重的罪，特别是在拔示巴和乌利亚的事件上。然而，大卫并非宣称自己无罪，而是在表明，他的一生是以对神的忠心为根基的。即使他曾犯罪，他仍会真诚悔改，寻求神的赦免（正如在《诗篇》第 51 篇中所展现的）。

> [!important]+ 反思与回应
今天，当你向神祷告时，不妨回想这首得胜的诗歌。如果你信靠耶稣，你已经经历了神最终极的拯救。借着基督的死与复活，我们得以胜过撒旦、罪恶和死亡。这正是值得颂扬的美好福音！

📖 **Passage to read**: ==2 Samuel 22==

> [!info]- 🎙️Audio: [A Daily Devotional - 04.29 - EN]()  

Many sports teams celebrate victories by singing Queen’s We Are the Champions. If King David had a victory song, it would have been quite different. By this point in 2 Samuel, David had become the most powerful leader in his region. His kingdom was fully under his rule. Saul’s family and other rivals were gone. The Philistines and other enemy nations had been defeated. But instead of boasting about his own strength, David sang a song praising the Lord, giving Him full credit for his success.

David begins with a powerful declaration:

“The LORD is my rock and my fortress and my deliverer, my God, my rock, in whom I take refuge, my shield, and the horn of my salvation, my stronghold and my refuge, my savior; you save me from violence.” (2 Sam. 22:2–3)

For David, God was his true source of strength. He was David’s defender and protector, the one who rescued him from danger.

David also recognized that God’s power was behind everything that had happened in his life. In verses 8–16, he describes God’s appearance in dramatic, cosmic terms. God “bowed the heavens and came down,” and He “thundered from heaven” (22:10, 14). David saw God as the one waging war against his enemies and knew that every victory he had won was because of God’s mighty hand.

Then, David made a statement that might seem prideful at first:

“The LORD dealt with me according to my righteousness; according to the cleanness of my hands he rewarded me.” (2 Sam. 22:21)

Was David claiming to be perfect? Certainly not! We know about his sins, especially what happened with Bathsheba and Uriah. But David wasn’t saying he had never failed. Rather, he was declaring that his life was marked by faithfulness to God. Even when he sinned, he repented and sought God’s forgiveness (as seen in Psalm 51).

> [!important]+ Reflect and Respond
As you pray today, remember this song of deliverance. If you have faith in Jesus, you have already experienced God’s ultimate victory. Through Christ’s death and resurrection, we have been given victory over Satan, sin, and death. That’s something worth singing about!
