### Good desserts at Aloha Cafe - simple

Last Saturday, my friend and I visited Aloha Cafe, a new restaurant on the main street opposite the bus station.

When we walked in, we **felt welcome**. The staff **greeted us cheerfully**, saying, "Aloha! Welcome." The cafe **was cosy**, with small wooden tables and chairs. A waitress in a flowery apron showed us to our table and gave us **the menu**. The prices were affordable. We **ordered** two cups of hot chocolate, a plate of pasta, and the cafe’s special dessert, the Aloha Waffle. While we waited, we looked at the walls, which had photos of Hawaii and hanging orchid plants.

After 20 minutes, the food arrived. The Aloha Waffle **looked amazing**, like something for Instagram! It had fresh fruit and cream on top. The warm waffle with the cold toppings **tasted delicious**. However, the pasta **was disappointing**. It did not have enough sauce and tasted bland.

Overall, Aloha Cafe is a nice place to relax. The staff **is friendly**, the prices are **good,** and the cafe **looks beautiful**. But the food quality is not always the same. I recommend visiting to try the Aloha Waffle!

### Good desserts at Aloha Cafe - harder

A new restaurant called Aloha Cafe opened on the main street of my town opposite the bust station. My friend and I decided to check it out, so we went there for tea last Saturday.

We felt comfortable right away as we stepped into the cafe. Cheerful voices called our "Aloha! Welcome." The place **looked cosy** with small round wooden tables and matching wooden chairs. A smiling waitress wearing a pretty flowery apron showed us to our table and handed us the menu. The food prices **looked reasonable**. We ordered two cups of hot chocolate, a place of pasta and their house specialty called the Aloha Waffle. While waiting for our food, we **admired the interesting decor**. The walls **were decorated with** photographs of Hawaii while a few orchid plants hung from the ceiling.

Our food was served after twenty minutes. **It was worth the wait** because the Aloha Waffle was **an Instrgrammable work of art**. The waffle was topped with colourful pieces of fresh fruit and cream. The cold topping the the hot waffle made a delectable combination. In contrast, **we found** the pasta dish **very ordinary**. there was too little sauce, so the dish **was rather tasteless**.

To conclude, Alhoa Cafe is **a pleasant place to hang out**. It has good service and **decent prices**. On the minus side, the **quality** of the food **is not consistent**. Still, I would recommend that my friends visit this cafe and try the wonderful Aloha Waffle.
