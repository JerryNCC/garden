### <center>致命的对决</center>

> [!info]- 🎙️Audio: [A Daily Devotional - 05.15 - CN]()

故事至此，以利亚一直在幕后行事。他传讲神的话语，却刻意避开亚哈王。但现在，这一切将发生改变。以利亚要站到台前。他要在亚哈面前现身，不是为自己，而是为要让王和众百姓看清，谁才是以色列真正的神。

在我们进入迦密山的决战前，值得先提一提俄巴底亚。这人担任亚哈王宫中的总管，职位不低，却身处邪恶之中。但他仍然敬畏耶和华，未曾像其他人一样拜偶像。更难能可贵的是，他在耶洗别追杀先知时，暗中救下了一百位耶和华的先知，将他们藏起来，供给他们饮食。俄巴底亚安静却坚定的信仰，提醒我们，即使身处黑暗之中，依然可以忠于神。

接下来，就是对决的时刻了。亚哈或许心想，这是当众羞辱以利亚、彻底除掉他的好机会。众人齐聚迦密山。以利亚向百姓提出一个简单的试炼：那位能从天降火、焚烧祭物的神，就是真神。巴力的先知先登场。他们呼喊、跳舞，甚至用刀割自己的身体，试图唤起巴力的回应。但天上无声无息，一点火光也无。

接着轮到以利亚。他却反而让挑战更困难——他吩咐人将大量的水倒在祭坛上，湿透了木柴与祭物。他要众人清楚地看到，若有火降下，必定是出于神的作为，而非人的安排。以利亚祷告，天火随即而降，焚烧了祭物、木柴、石头，甚至连沟中的水也被烧尽。百姓伏地敬畏，终于认出：耶和华才是真神。他们照着以利亚的话，除灭了巴力的假先知。

百姓本该早已记得，是神将他们从埃及为奴之地中救出，引领他们走过旷野，赐下应许之地，又为他们兴起大卫作王。但正如我们常常会忘记一样，他们也忘了。所以，神藉着天降烈火，再一次提醒他们——祂是独一的神，配得他们的敬畏与敬拜。

> [!important]+ 反思与回应
愿我们今天也花些时间祷告，求神再次提醒我们祂是谁。祂与世上的任何人事物都不相同——满有怜悯、公义、圣洁、能力和慈爱。唯有祂，配得我们全心全意的敬拜与信靠。世上一切，都无法与祂相比。

### <center>A Fatal Duel</center>

> [!question]+ Review
> 1. ⁠How does the Bible show that Ahab was more evil than the kings before him? What specific sins are described in 1 Kings 16:30–31?
> 2. How did God respond through Elijah during one of the darkest times in Israel’s history? What does this reveal about God’s character and actions?
> 3. In times of darkness or confusion in your life, have you experienced God bringing light through His word or someone He used? Share an example.

📖 **Passage to read**: ==1 Kings 18:01-40==

> [!info]- 🎙️Audio: [A Daily Devotional - 05.15 - EN]()  

So far in the story, Elijah has stayed behind the scenes. He speaks God’s word, but keeps his distance from King Ahab. But now, that’s about to change. Elijah will step out into the open. He will stand before Ahab, not for his own sake, but to show the king and the people who the true God of Israel really is.

Before we talk about the showdown on Mount Carmel, it’s worth noticing a man named Obadiah. He had a hard job—he worked for King Ahab, one of the most wicked kings in Israel’s history. Even so, Obadiah still feared the Lord. He didn’t bow to the idols like others did. In fact, he secretly saved one hundred of God’s prophets when Queen Jezebel was hunting them down. He hid them and gave them food and water. Obadiah’s quiet courage reminds us that it’s possible to stay faithful to God even in dark times.

Now we come to the contest. Ahab probably saw this as the perfect moment to discredit Elijah—and maybe finally get rid of him. Everyone gathers on Mount Carmel. Elijah gives the people a simple test: the real God will send fire from heaven to burn the sacrifice on the altar. Baal’s prophets go first. They cry out, dance, and even cut themselves to get their god’s attention. But nothing happens. Not a sound. No fire.

Then it’s Elijah’s turn. But he makes it harder for himself. He pours lots of water on the altar, soaking everything. He wants it to be clear—if fire comes, it has to come from God. Then he prays. And fire falls from heaven. It burns the sacrifice, the wood, the stones, the water—everything. The people fall down in fear. They finally see the truth: the Lord is the only God. And they follow Elijah’s command to remove the false prophets of Baal.

The people should have remembered. God had rescued them from slavery in Egypt. He led them through the wilderness, gave them the promised land, and raised up David as their king. But like all of us, they forgot. So here, God reminds them—through a powerful sign from heaven—that He alone is God. He alone should be worshiped and feared.

> [!important]+ Reflect and Respond
Take time today to ask God to remind you of who He is. He’s not like anyone else. He is full of mercy, power, justice, holiness, and love. He is the only one who deserves your full heart. Nothing else comes close.
