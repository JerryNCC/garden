### <center>水变酒</center>

> [!info]- 🎙️Audio: [None]()


约翰是那位带领我们看见耶稣神迹目的的福音书作者。他并不称这些作为“神迹奇事”，而是称为“神迹”。那么，神迹的作用是什么呢？它指向超越自身的事物。耶稣所行的神迹正是如此，它们显明更深的真理——祂是谁，祂来是要成就什么。在约翰福音2章1至12节，我们读到第一个神迹：耶稣使水变成酒。

那时，耶稣、祂的母亲和门徒们都参加一场婚宴。忽然，出了一个难题——酒用尽了。对主人家而言，这是一件极大的羞耻。耶稣的母亲马利亚向祂求助。耶稣便吩咐仆人，将几口大水缸倒满水，然后送到管宴席的那里。在这个过程中，水竟变成了酒。管宴席的尝了那酒，就称赞新郎，把好酒留到最后才拿出来。这个头一个神迹向我们显明了什么呢？

从这件事，我们学到许多功课。首先，耶稣显出祂对自然界的权能，能使水的本质改变成酒。这是创造的作为，唯有神才能成就。其次，耶稣显出祂对平凡人的关怀。祂本可以袖手旁观，但祂没有；祂在一场乡村婚宴上满足了一个简单的需要。祂并非远离世事，而是亲近我们日常的生活。

门徒们的回应如何呢？约翰在第11节告诉我们，耶稣藉着这神迹显出祂的荣耀，祂的门徒就信了祂。这正是所有神迹的目的：使人信祂是神的儿子。

> [!important]+ 反思与回应
我们的回应也当如此——信靠耶稣。求神坚固你的信心，信靠那位能使水变酒、并能成就远超过此的主，把生命的每一部分都交托给祂。

### <center>Water into Wine</center>

> [!question]+ Review
> 1.⁠ ⁠How does John 1:1–3 describe Jesus’ eternal nature and His role in creation?
2.⁠ ⁠What is the special meaning of the word “dwelt” in the phrase “the Word became flesh and dwelt among us”?
3.⁠ ⁠Why does John begin his Gospel with Jesus’ identity and essence rather than with genealogy or historical details?

📖 **Passage to read**: ==John 02:01-12==

> [!info]- 🎙️Audio: [None]()  

John is the gospel writer who helps us see the purpose behind Jesus’s miracles. He doesn’t call them miracles but signs. And what does a sign do? It points to something beyond itself. That’s what Jesus’s signs are meant to do. They show us a deeper truth about who he is and what he came to do. In John 2:1–12, we read about the first of these signs: Jesus turning water into wine.

Jesus, his mother, and his disciples are guests at a wedding. A problem comes up—the wine runs out. For the hosts, this is a serious embarrassment. Mary, the mother of Jesus, turns to him for help. Jesus gives instructions to the servants. They fill large jars with water and bring them to the master of the feast. Somewhere in the process, the water becomes wine. The master tastes it and praises the bridegroom for saving the best wine for last. What does this first sign tell us about Jesus?

We learn a lot from this event. First, Jesus shows his power over the natural world. He can change the very substance of water into wine. This is a real act of creation, something no one else can do. Second, Jesus shows his care for ordinary people. He could have ignored the need and done nothing. But he doesn’t. He meets a simple, social need at a small-town wedding. He is not distant or detached from everyday life.

How do the disciples respond? John tells us in verse 11 that Jesus revealed his glory through this sign, and his disciples believed in him. That is the goal of all Jesus’s signs: to bring people to faith in him as the Son of God.

> [!important]+ Reflect and Respond
Our response should be the same. Believe in Jesus. Ask God to strengthen your faith in the one who turns water into wine—and who can do far more than that. Trust him with every part of your life.
