### <center>作神葡萄园的结果子者</center>

> [!info]- 🎙️Audio: [A Daily Devotional - 07.27 - CN]()

旧约中的先知，有一个重要的使命，就是帮助百姓从上帝的眼光看事情。这正是以赛亚在第五章所做的。他以一首歌开场——这首歌旨在向百姓展现上帝如何看待他们的罪与悖逆。

以赛亚称这是一首“为我所亲爱的”所唱的爱情之歌（5:1）。这位“亲爱的”就是上帝，而这首歌是唱给祂百姓听的。以赛亚用葡萄园比喻上帝的子民。上帝亲自栽种这葡萄园，充满慈爱地精心照料。祂耕种土地，清除石头，甚至建造瞭望台来保护它。上帝为这园子所需的一切都已预备妥当，本应结出甘甜的葡萄，然而结果却是野葡萄——酸涩无用的果子。藉着这个比喻，以赛亚深刻地揭露出上帝子民的败坏：他们并未照祂所期望的成长。

紧接着，以赛亚转向上帝的回应。到这一刻，我们很容易明白上帝为何愤怒。若是你倾注了心力、时间和爱，却仍得不到应有的结果，你也会感到失望。所以上帝宣告：祂将撤去对葡萄园的保护，围墙将被拆毁，仇敌将闯入，攻占并吞噬祂的百姓。这是对那不愿顺服、拒绝成长的百姓所发出的审判。

这段信息并不仅限于古代以色列人，也关乎你我。耶稣说：好树结好果子，坏树结坏果子。若我们属祂，是祂用宝血买赎的子民，就当为父神结出果子。这果子虽不能拯救我们，却能显明我们心灵的光景，正如在以赛亚的时代一样。

如今我们就是神的葡萄园，栽植在基督里。祂呼召我们靠着圣灵的能力，在祂里面成长，并结出荣耀祂的果子。

今天就向天父祷告，求祂修理你心灵的园地，使你在耶稣里茁壮成长，并结出合祂心意的果子，使祂的名得荣耀。

### <center>Bearing Fruit as God’s Vineyard</center>

> [!question]+ Review
> 1. ⁠What kind of glorious future does Isaiah describe in chapter 2, and why is it so important?
> 2. Why were God's people unable to live out this vision? What went wrong with them?
> 3. How does the Lord respond to His people's rebellion? What does this reveal about His character?

📖 **Passage to read**: ==Isaiah 05:01-07==

> [!info]- 🎙️Audio: [A Daily Devotional - 07.27 - EN]()  


One thing Old Testament prophets did was help people see things from God’s point of view. That’s what Isaiah is doing in Isaiah 5. He begins with a song—a song meant to show the people how God sees their sin and rebellion.

Isaiah says it’s a love song, sung for someone dear to him (5:1). That someone is God. And the ones the song is about are God’s people. Isaiah compares them to a vineyard. God planted this vineyard with care. He cleared the land. He took out the stones. He even built a watchtower to protect it. God did everything needed for it to grow good grapes. But instead of sweet grapes, it grew wild ones. The fruit was bad—useless. Through this image, Isaiah shows how much God gave to his people, and how they failed to grow as they should.

Then Isaiah shifts to God’s response. And by this point, it’s not hard to understand why God is upset. If you poured time, love, and energy into something that failed, you’d feel it too. So God says he will remove his protection from the vineyard. The walls will be torn down. Enemies will come in. The people will be taken over and broken. That’s God’s judgment on those who refuse to grow and obey.

This message isn’t just for Israel. It’s for us too. Jesus said good trees bear good fruit, and bad trees bear bad fruit. If we belong to him, we’ve been bought with his blood. We are now called to bear fruit for God. That fruit doesn’t save us, but it does reveal what’s in our hearts—just like it did in Isaiah’s day.

We are God’s vineyard now. We are planted in Christ. And through the Spirit, we are called to grow and bear fruit that honors him.

So ask your Father today to shape your heart. Ask him to help you grow strong in Jesus and bear the kind of fruit that brings glory to him.
