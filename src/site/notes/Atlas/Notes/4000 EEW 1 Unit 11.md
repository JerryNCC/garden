### Keeping Our Earth Clean

Across the world, places are increasing their efforts to recycle and help the environment. Recycling is when trash is reused and not thrown away. In recent **history**, more and more **cities** and **countries** have started recycling. These places have developed their recycling programs to stop our Earth from being covered with trash and **black**, dirty air. 

According to the Environment Protection Agency in the United States, recycling also helps save energy. The agency encourages the recycling of **glass** and **plastic** bottles, paper, and aluminum cans. Many European countries have strong recycling programs as well. Austria, Germany, and Norway are well known for being leaders in recycling, and South Korea and Wales are countries that have a lot of recycling as well.

There are many reasons why some countries recycle more than others. The **fact** is that these governments support recycling, and they are **aware** of its importance. There is also a lot of money spent on recycling. However, it is also necessary for **people** to try hard to recycle what they can from their own homes.

Other ways to fight the waste **problem** also exist. Many cities place recycling bins on their **streets**. There are recycling projects across some cities. - and in these projects companies **advertise** the need to recycle. This helps keep the city streets **clean**. 

**Electric** cars are another way to keep the environment clean. The motors of these cars are electric. They get their power from electricity and **batteries** rather than from gas.

The hope is that **eventually** all cities in all countries will recycle and make our Earth a cleaner place. We must protect **nature** and **never** stop thinking about how to protect it. So **think** before you throw away something that can be recycled!
