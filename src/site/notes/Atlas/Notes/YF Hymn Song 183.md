Light of the World  
You stepped down into darkness  
Opened my eyes let me see  
Beauty that made this heart adore You  
Hope of a life spent with You  

**CHORUS:**  
Here I am to worship  
Here I am to bow down  
Here I am to say that You’re my God  
You’re altogether lovely  
Altogether worthy  
Altogether wonderful to me  

**VERSE 2:**  
King of all days  
Oh so highly exalted  
Glorious in heaven above  
Humbly You came to the Earth You created  
All for love’s sake became poor  

**BRIDGE:**  
And I’ll never know how much it cost  
To see my sin upon that cross  
TAG:  
Call upon the name of the Lord  
And be saved
