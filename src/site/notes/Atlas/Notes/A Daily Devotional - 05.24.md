### <center>审判与流亡的战鼓</center>

> [!info]- 🎙️Audio: [A Daily Devotional - 05.24 - CN]()

在J.R.R. 托尔金的《指环王》一书中，探险队站在摩利亚矿洞的深处，阅读着一场许多年前在他们脚下发生的战斗的记载。故事中描述了敌人的鼓声越来越近，战斗即将到来，他们听见了那渐近的鼓声。这有些像我们读到以色列王国衰退时的情形。我们听到了审判和流亡的战鼓声，起初还很远，但如今它们越来越近。神对罪的惩罚即将降临，王国的统治不会永远持续下去。然而，即便是在这场衰退的过程中，我们也能看到神的恩典的微光。即使在审判中，神永远不会完全抛弃祂的百姓！

伟大的先知以利沙已经去世，王朝的更替依旧继续。耶罗波安二世登上了以色列的王位，而他并不出乎意料地再次成为一位不敬畏也不顺服神的王。作者用熟悉的词汇总结了他的统治：“他行耶和华眼中看为恶的事，并没有离开尼巴的儿子耶罗波安使以色列人犯罪的罪” (14:24)。

尽管耶罗波安二世的恶行，圣经却告诉我们，“他照耶和华以色列神的话恢复了以色列的边界” (14:25)。在这样的一个恶王统治下，神依然允许以色列的王国一度得以扩展！这段经文告诉我们，首先，耶罗波安看见了百姓的苦难，那是非常痛苦的。然而，更重要的是，我们看到神对祂的应许保持信实。神向祂的百姓显明祂的爱，这份爱并没有将他们从地球上完全抹去。即使在审判中，神的计划从来都不是要将祂的百姓完全消灭。是的，神会惩罚罪恶，但随着圣经故事的展开，我们越来越多地听到关于神如何保守祂那忠诚的剩余子民的事，即便是在流亡、惩罚和审判之中。

> [!important]+ 反思与回应
感谢神，尽管祂本可以公正地放弃我们，但祂却差遣祂的儿子耶稣，为我们带来了完美且永恒的救恩。通过耶稣，我们得到了罪的赦免和永生的希望。今天，感谢神赐给我们的伟大恩典。

### <center>Drums of Judgment and Exile*</center>

> [!question]+ Review
> 1. ⁠⁠Why did Jehoash want to repair the temple of God? What specific actions did he take to accomplish this goal?
> 2. Even though Jehoash was a faithful king, why did God's judgment still come upon Israel?
> 3. ⁠How did Jehoash demonstrate reverence and responsibility towards God in the process of repairing the temple? What lessons can we draw from his actions for our own faith life today?

📖 **Passage to read**: ==2 Kings 14:23-29==

> [!info]- 🎙️Audio: [A Daily Devotional - 05.24 - EN]()  

In J.R.R. Tolkien’s *The Fellowship of the Ring*, the Fellowship stands deep in the Mines of Moria, reading about a battle that was fought many years earlier on the very ground they stand. The story describes the sound of drums getting closer and closer as the enemy approaches. The battle is coming, and they can hear it. It’s a bit like what we experience when we read about Israel’s monarchy declining. We hear the drums of judgment and exile, at first in the distance, but now drawing nearer and nearer. God’s punishment for sin is approaching, and the monarchy will not last forever. Yet, even as this decline continues, we also see glimpses of God’s grace. Even in judgment, God will not abandon His people forever!

The great prophet Elisha has passed away, and the cycle of kings continues. Jeroboam II now takes the throne in Israel, and, unsurprisingly, he is another king who does not fear or obey God. The writer sums up his reign in familiar terms: "He did what was evil in the sight of the LORD. He did not depart from all the sins of Jeroboam son of Nebat, which he made Israel to sin" (14:24).

Despite the wickedness of Jeroboam II, we see that "he restored the border of Israel... according to the word of the LORD, the God of Israel" (14:25). In the midst of such a bad king, God still allowed the kingdom of Israel to grow for a time! The passage tells us that, first, Jeroboam saw the affliction of his people, which was very bitter. But more importantly, we see that God was being faithful to His promise. God was showing His love for His people—a love that would not completely erase them from the earth. God’s plan, even in judgment, was never to destroy them entirely. Yes, God will punish sin, but as the story of the Bible unfolds, we hear more and more about how God preserves a faithful remnant of His people, even through exile, punishment, and judgment.

> [!important]+ Reflect and Respond
Thank God that, even though He could have justly given up on us, He sent His Son, Jesus, to bring perfect and eternal salvation. Through Him, we find forgiveness from sin and the hope of eternal life. Praise God for His amazing grace today.
