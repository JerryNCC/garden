### <center>终于！</center>

在《撒母耳记下》5章的事件发生之前，先知撒母耳曾经悄悄地走到耶西家中，膏立了年轻的大卫作为以色列的下一任王。如今，经过多年——在荒野中的漂泊、在异乡的寄居、以及无数次险象环生的经历之后——大卫终于迎来了掌管整个王国的时刻。《撒母耳记下》第五章是充满喜悦和达到高峰感的篇章。我们看到大卫被坚实地立为王，得到了百姓的全力支持，并在打败神和祂百姓的敌人后巩固了他的王权。

大卫从一个牧羊少年到成为王，没有任何合理的解释，除了这是一位全能的神按祂主权所安排的计划。大卫是父亲家中的最小儿子，曾经是一个无名小卒，而如今，他却掌管了整个神的子民。大卫的伟大与权力是神在他生命中所施展的手段，除此之外没有任何其他的解释。我们也需要认识到，尽管这不是圣经故事的终点，但毫无疑问，这是故事中的一个伟大高峰。我们看到神的国度达到了一个辉煌的高点：祂的百姓（以色列人）在祂的地方——耶路撒冷——并在祂所拣选的王、大卫的统治下。

百姓们在长老的带领下齐聚一堂，认定大卫是他们的合法王：“看哪，我们是你的骨肉……耶和华曾对你说：‘你必牧养我的百姓以色列，你必作以色列的领袖’”（5:1–2）。神的百姓同心合意，承认大卫是神所立的王，愿意向他效忠。这对神的百姓而言，是一个关键的时刻——圣经故事中的一个真正的高点。

正如以色列百姓齐聚大卫四周，确认他神所赋予的领导地位，我们也应当围绕我们的伟大领袖——耶稣——团结起来。祂是为我们争战的那一位。祂是为神的百姓带来真正合一的那一位。耶稣是那位最终的英雄——出人意料的英雄，祂通过自己在十字架上的牺牲死亡与三日后的复活，战胜了我们的敌人——罪、撒旦和死亡。

> [!important]+ 反思与回应
今天，让我们祈祷，求神帮助我们对我们的救主和王有完全的忠诚。求神使我们全心全意投入到为祂的旨意而活、为祂的目的而服务的事业中。祈求我们的身份根基深植于与耶稣的关系中。

### <center>*Finally!*</center>

> [!question]+ Review
> 1. ⁠Why, after the death of Saul and Jonathan, did Israel fall into a situation of unclear leadership? How did David become the leader according to God’s will?
> 2. ⁠How do the struggles between Ishbosheth and David demonstrate God's sovereignty and God's choosing of David?
> 3. How does David demonstrate his trust in God, and how does he choose to follow God’s teaching when faced with opportunities for revenge?

📖 **Passage to read**: ==2 Samuel 05==

> [!info]- 🎙️Audio: [A Daily Devotional - 04.20 - EN]()  


Years before the events in 2 Samuel 5, the prophet Samuel had visited Jesse’s house and secretly anointed a young David to be Israel’s next king. Now, after many years—filled with wandering in the wilderness, living in foreign lands, and facing countless dangers—the time has come for David to take full control of the kingdom. 2 Samuel 5 is a chapter filled with joy and a strong sense of arrival. We read about David being firmly established as king, receiving full support from the people, and strengthening his rule as he defeats the enemies of God and His people.

There is no logical explanation for how a shepherd boy like David could rise to power, except that it is part of God’s sovereign plan. David was the youngest and least important son of his father, and now he rules over all of God’s people. David’s greatness and authority are a direct result of God’s hand in his life. There is simply no other explanation. While this moment isn’t the end of the Bible’s story, it is undeniably one of its highest points. We see the kingdom of God coming to a glorious point: His people, the Israelites, are in His place, Jerusalem, under the rule of His chosen king, David.

The people, led by their elders, come together around David, recognizing him as their rightful king: “Behold, we are your bone and flesh... And the LORD said to you, ‘You shall be shepherd of my people Israel, and you shall be prince over Israel’” (5:1–2). With one united voice, the people affirm David as God’s king, pledging their loyalty to him. This is a key moment for God’s people, a true high point in the story of the Bible.

Just as the people of Israel gathered around David, affirming his God-given leadership, we should also gather around our great leader, Jesus. He is the one who fights our battles for us. He is the one who brings true unity to God’s people. Jesus is the ultimate hero—the unexpected hero who overcame our enemies—sin, Satan, and death—by His sacrificial death on the cross and His resurrection three days later.

> [!important]+ Reflect and Respond
Today, let us pray that we would have total and complete loyalty to our Savior and King. Ask God to help us be fully committed to serving His purpose in this world. Pray that our identity would be rooted in our relationship with Jesus.
