### <center>不要灰心</center>

> [!info]- 🎙️Audio: [None]()



我们每个人都会经历灰心失望的时候，有些人甚至会陷入深深的疲惫与忧郁之中。然而，很少有人像使徒保罗那样，经历那样多的苦难——被鞭打、被囚禁、遇船难、被人拒绝、四处遭受危险。他的事奉之路从不轻松。但就在这章一开始，保罗却写下令人震惊的话：“我们不丧胆”（4:1）。他怎么能这样说？他是如何在重重患难中仍然不灰心的呢？

首先，保罗不灰心，因为他深知，最终掌管人心、决定谁信福音、谁拒绝真理的，是上帝自己。保罗的责任不是改变人的心，而是忠心地传讲福音。其余的，都交托给神。他说，福音被蒙蔽，是“蒙蔽在灭亡的人身上”（4:3）。有些人被“这世界的神”（撒但）弄瞎了心眼，看不见基督荣耀的光。但这并没有阻止保罗前行——他仍继续传讲，相信上帝会开启他所拣选之人的心眼。

其次，保罗不灰心，因为他看见自己的软弱正好成就上帝的荣耀。上帝乐意借着像保罗这样“瓦器”的人来传扬祂的福音，好叫人明白，那超越的能力不是出于人，乃是出于神（4:7）。当保罗面对痛苦与逼迫时，他并不看成失败，而是视为上帝能力显明的机会。他的软弱，反而成了上帝大能更清晰展现的舞台。

最后，保罗不灰心，因为他知道，这世界的苦难并不是故事的结局。眼前的一切艰辛，不过是暂时的；在那之后，有永恒的荣耀正等待着他。那荣耀的重量，将使今生一切的痛苦都显得微不足道。保罗称之为“极重无比、永远的荣耀”（4:17）。这是他的盼望——也是我们的盼望。若你属于耶稣，这荣耀同样属于你。你将与救主一同分享那永恒的荣光。

> [!important]+ 反思与回应
所以，当你感到疲惫、灰心时，求神提醒你：你生命中最大的益处，就是祂得着荣耀。祷告吧，求祂帮助你，不被眼前的困难所困，而是仰望那看不见却真实的永恒荣耀。也求天父借着圣灵赐你力量，使你每天都能坚定前行，不至灰心丧胆。

### <center>Don’t Lose Heart</center>

> [!question]+ Review

📖 **Passage to read**: ==2 Corinthians 04==

> [!info]- 🎙️Audio: [None]()  


We all face moments of discouragement. Some of us even walk through seasons of deep weariness or depression. But few have endured the kind of hardships that the apostle Paul faced: beatings, imprisonment, shipwrecks, rejection, and constant danger. His ministry was filled with struggle. Yet, right at the beginning of this chapter, Paul writes something astonishing: “We do not lose heart” (4:1). How could he say that? How could he remain strong through so much pain?

Paul doesn’t lose heart, first of all, because he knows that God is in control of the results of his ministry. It’s not Paul’s job to make people believe the gospel. His job is to preach it faithfully. The rest is in God’s hands. Paul says that the gospel is hidden “to those who are perishing” (4:3). Some people are blinded by “the god of this world”—Satan—so that they can’t see the light of Christ. But that doesn’t stop Paul. He keeps preaching, trusting that God will open the eyes of those whom he calls.

Second, Paul doesn’t lose heart because his weakness serves a purpose. God chooses to display his power through fragile, ordinary people—“jars of clay” (4:7). That way, no one mistakes where the real power comes from. When Paul suffers or struggles, he doesn’t see defeat; he sees a chance for God’s glory to shine through his weakness. His hardships become a stage for God’s strength to be seen more clearly.

Finally, Paul refuses to lose heart because he knows that this life is not the end of the story. Beyond the suffering and brokenness of this world lies a glory so great that it will make all present pain seem light by comparison. Paul calls it “an eternal weight of glory beyond all comparison” (4:17). That is his hope—and ours too. If you belong to Jesus, your future is secure. You will share in the eternal glory of Christ your Savior.

> [!important]+ Reflect and Respond
So when you feel weary, ask God to remind you that his glory is your greatest good. Pray that he would help you fix your eyes not on what is seen, but on what is unseen—on the glory that lasts forever. And ask your heavenly Father, through his Spirit, to give you strength each day so that you, too, will not lose heart.
