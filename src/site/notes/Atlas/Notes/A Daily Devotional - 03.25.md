### <center>他们想要的王，却不是他们需要的王</center>

> [!info]- 🎙️Audio: [A Daily Devotional - 03.24 - CN]()

基甸以一种只能用神迹来形容的方式领导以色列。因此，以色列百姓想要立他为王也就不足为奇了。他们对基甸说：“你当治理我们，你和你的儿子、孙子也都要治理我们，因为你救了我们脱离米甸人的手。”（士8:22）百姓并不仅仅是希望基甸做他们的临时士师；他们希望建立一个王朝——由基甸及其后代来统治他们。难道他就是那个能够打破罪与审判循环、带领以色列进入持久忠诚统治的王吗？

答案很快就揭晓了。基甸并不是以色列所需要的王。这里有两个主要问题向我们展示了这一点。首先，当百姓请求基甸做他们的统治者时，他向他们索要黄金，制作了一个以弗得（祭司所穿的外衣），并且这个以弗得最终变成了一个偶像。百姓开始崇拜这个以弗得，而不是那位通过基甸赐给他们胜利的神。这是一个巨大的失败。作为神的百姓的王，他本该带领他们敬拜并顺服独一的神，但相反，基甸却把他们引向了偶像崇拜。第二，我们还发现基甸为自己娶了许多妻子，这并不是一种神所喜悦的领导方式。

可悲的是，在基甸去世后，他在世时带来的那份平安也随之消失，以色列又重新陷入了罪恶的循环。《士师记》的作者特别提到，在基甸死后，百姓马上就偏离了神，开始崇拜偶像（8:33）。这几乎没有花费太长时间——一旦基甸去世，百姓就迅速回到他们的罪恶之中，忘记了神为他们所做的一切。

> [!important]+ 反思与回应
在你急于批评以色列百姓之前，试着站在他们的立场上。对普通的以色列人来说，要在群众的压力下站出来，拒绝基甸的以弗得，一定是非常困难的。今天，当你祷告时，要感谢神赐给我们祂的儿子——那位完美且忠信的领袖，他引导我们。祈求神帮助你紧紧依靠祂，跟随祂的榜样、教训和话语，这样你才能抵挡这个世界上所有的罪恶诱惑。

### <center>The King They Want but Not the One They Need</center>

> [!question]+ Review
> 1. ⁠Why does God, in Judges 7, teach the Israelites not to boast in their victory? What does this teach us about how we should view God’s work in our lives?
> 2. ⁠Why did God reduce Gideon's army to just 300 men? How does this choice reflect God's purpose and power?
> 3. How can we rely on God's strength instead of our own when facing weaknesses and challenges in life to achieve victory?

📖 **Passage to read**: ==Judges 07==

> [!info]- 🎙️Audio: [A Daily Devotional - 03.24 - EN]()  

Gideon had led Israel in a way that could only be described as miraculous. It's no surprise, then, that the people of Israel wanted to make him their king. They said to him, “Rule over us, you and your son and your grandson also, for you have saved us from the hand of Midian” (8:22). The people weren’t just looking for a temporary judge to lead them; they wanted a dynasty—a king and his descendants to rule over them. Could this be the one who would finally break the cycle of sin and judgment and lead Israel in a lasting, faithful reign?

The answer comes quickly. Gideon is not the king that Israel needs. There are two major problems that show us this. First, when the people ask Gideon to rule over them, he requests their gold to make an ephod, which turns into an idol. The people start to worship the ephod instead of the God who had given them victory through Gideon. This is a huge failure. The king of God’s people was supposed to lead them in worship and obedience to God, but instead, Gideon led them to idol worship. Second, we learn that Gideon took many wives for himself, which wasn’t a sign of godly leadership.

Sadly, after Gideon’s death, the peace they had during his lifetime faded, and Israel fell back into the sin cycle. The writer of Judges notes that as soon as Gideon died, the people turned away from God and began worshiping idols (8:33). It didn’t take long at all—once Gideon was gone, the people went right back to their sinful ways and forgot everything God had done for them.

> [!important]+ Reflect and Respond
Before you rush to criticize the people of Israel, try to put yourself in their shoes. It must have been very difficult for the average Israelite to stand against the popular opinion and say no to Gideon’s ephod. As you pray today, thank God for giving us His Son—the perfect, faithful leader who guides us. Ask Him to help you stay close to Him, to follow His example, teachings, and words, so that you can resist the sinful pressures of this world.
