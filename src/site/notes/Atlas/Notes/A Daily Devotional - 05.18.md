### <center>亚哈、约沙法与亚哈谢</center>

> [!info]- 🎙️Audio: [A Daily Devotional - 05.18 - CN]()

在圣经中，犹大和以色列两国并肩作战的情形并不多见，但这次是个例外。以色列王亚哈与犹大王约沙法联手，对抗亚兰王的军队。出征前，先知米该雅曾明确警告亚哈：他将在战斗中丧命。然而，亚哈并未理会。他自以为聪明，试图通过伪装自己来躲避命运。

但他的计划失败了。战斗中，一名士兵随意射出一箭，正中亚哈的要害，致命的伤口让他无法挽回。战后，仆人们在撒马利亚的池旁清洗亚哈的战车，狗来舔他的血——正如先知以利亚多年前所预言的那样。

随着《列王纪上》的结束，我们看到了两位新王的登场：犹大的约沙法和以色列的亚哈谢。他们的行径截然不同。约沙法虽与亚哈有交情，但他努力行耶和华眼中看为正的事。他未能彻底铲除丘坛，但却清除了父亲时代遗留的庙妓之患。相反，亚哈谢效法其父亚哈，行耶和华眼中看为恶的事，拜巴力，引导以色列人陷入罪中，激怒了神。

以色列正迅速走向败亡。神的审判临近，流亡的命运即将降临。犹大虽能多维持一段时间，但终究难逃失败的命运。《列王纪下》将继续讲述这段悲惨而罪恶的历史，直至神的子民被惩罚。显然，人类的君王并非神子民的最终答案。神必有更伟大、更永恒的计划，将祂的子民永远带入祂的国度，置于祂的统治之下。

> [!important]+ 反思与回应
我们需要一位天上、完美、神圣的君王来引导、带领，甚至拯救我们。今天，花些时间向神祷告，承认祂是你真正的君王。求祂在你的心中和生活中居首位，并向祂承认你未能完全信靠祂的方式。

### <center>Ahab, Jehoshaphat, and Ahaziah</center>

> [!question]+ Review
> 1. ⁠Why did Ahab show repentance in response to God's judgment? Why did God respond to his repentance and delay the disaster?
> 2. Was Ahab’s repentance sincere? Why did God still show mercy to him?
> 3. ⁠In this passage, we see both God's justice and mercy. As believers, how should we respond to God’s mercy in our own lives?

📖 **Passage to read**: ==1 Kings 22:29-53==

> [!info]- 🎙️Audio: [A Daily Devotional - 05.18 - EN]()  

There aren’t many times in the Bible when Israel and Judah fight together on the same side, but this is one of them. King Ahab of Israel and King Jehoshaphat of Judah teamed up to go to war against the king of Syria. Before they went into battle, the prophet Micaiah gave Ahab a clear warning: he would die in the fight. But Ahab didn’t listen. He thought he could outsmart the prophet—and God—by disguising himself on the battlefield.

It didn’t work. In the middle of the battle, a soldier fired an arrow without aiming at anyone in particular, and it hit Ahab. The wound was fatal. After the fight, Ahab’s servants washed the blood out of his chariot, and stray dogs came and licked it up. This was exactly what the prophet Elijah had said would happen years earlier.

As 1 Kings comes to an end, we hear about two more kings: Jehoshaphat and Ahaziah. They couldn’t be more different. Jehoshaphat, even though he had ties to Ahab, tried to do what pleased God. He didn’t get rid of all the high places where people wrongly worshiped, but he did clean up a serious problem of prostitution that had spread in Judah. On the other hand, Ahaziah followed in Ahab’s footsteps. He did evil, worshiped Baal, and led Israel further into sin. Everything good Jehoshaphat did, Ahaziah ignored.

Israel was heading for trouble. God’s judgment was coming, and it wouldn’t be long before exile became their reality. Judah would last a little longer, but its time was also running out. The pattern was clear: king after king failed. Human rulers were not the solution.

> [!important]+ Reflect and Respond
God’s people needed more than just another king. They needed a true King—one who would never fail, who would lead with justice, mercy, and truth. We need that same King today. Take some time to pray. Acknowledge that God is your King. Ask Him to take His rightful place in your heart, and confess the ways you’ve held back from trusting Him fully.
