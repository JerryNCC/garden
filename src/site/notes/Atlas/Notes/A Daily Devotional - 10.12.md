### <center>上帝成就的使命</center>

> [!info]- 🎙️Audio: [None]()

想一想你看电影时的情景。就在故事似乎要结束的时候，一个意外的转折出现了，原来故事还没有完结，你才发现其实还有续集。路加福音与使徒行传正是如此。路加福音是第一部，记述耶稣的生平、事工、受死与复活。使徒行传则是第二部，继续讲述耶稣透过门徒所成就的事。那么，这续集的核心是什么呢？

首先，这是一个使命。门徒们曾经长期困惑，不明白耶稣的受死与复活究竟意味着什么。如今他们逐渐看清了。耶稣将要离去，这正表示他们的工作才刚刚开始。耶稣清楚地对他们说：“你们要在耶路撒冷、犹太全地和撒玛利亚，直到地极，作我的见证人”（徒1:8）。他们的使命就是把祂的名传扬到全世界。

其次，这使命并不是靠他们自己的力量去完成，而是由圣灵来成就。门徒自然舍不得耶稣离开，但祂的离去却意味着一份新的礼物——圣灵的降临。耶稣说：“但圣灵降临在你们身上，你们就必得着能力”（徒1:8）。祂早已应许他们将受圣灵的洗。换句话说，他们并不会孤单无助，因为神自己的灵要与他们同在，在这见证的使命中赐下能力与引导。

第三，这使命出自上帝自己。留心耶稣所用的言辞，你会发现祂所说的话，与耶和华在以赛亚书43:10–12中呼召以色列人作祂见证时所用的语言极其相似。如今，耶稣将这些话应用在自己身上。这是何等伟大的宣告！祂表明自己与神同等。门徒们被呼召作祂的见证，见证那位复活、被高举、为万主之主的基督。

> [!important]+ 反思与回应
这就是最美好的消息：这使命并没有随着第一代门徒而终止。因为他们忠心顺服，福音传遍了世界。如今，历经世代，跨越文化，福音已经临到你。感谢主耶稣将这使命托付给祂的子民，并且藉着他们的见证，使你得以认识祂，并在祂里面找到救恩。

### <center>Mission Made Possible by God</center>

> 1. How does Peter’s threefold denial of Jesus help us better understand Jesus’s restoration and forgiveness in John 21?
> 2. What is the significance of Jesus asking Peter three times, “Do you love me?” and then commissioning him to “feed my sheep”?
> 3. How does John 21 teach us that, even after failure, Jesus can still forgive, restore, and use us?

Think about when you watch a movie. Just as the story seems to be ending, a surprise twist shows that the story is not over yet. You realize there will be a sequel. That is exactly what happens with Luke’s Gospel and the book of Acts. Luke’s Gospel is part one—the story of Jesus’s life, ministry, death, and resurrection. Acts is part two, continuing the story of what Jesus does through his disciples. So, what is this sequel about?

First, it is about a mission. The disciples had been puzzled for a long time about what Jesus’s death and resurrection really meant. Now they begin to understand. Jesus is leaving, and that means their work is beginning. He tells them plainly: “You will be my witnesses in Jerusalem and in all Judea and Samaria, and to the end of the earth” (1:8). Their mission is to carry his name everywhere.

Second, this mission is not something they do in their own strength. It is empowered by the Holy Spirit. The disciples surely didn’t want Jesus to go away, but his leaving meant that another gift would come—the Holy Spirit. Jesus says, “You will receive power when the Holy Spirit has come upon you” (1:8). Earlier, he promised that they would be baptized with the Spirit. In other words, they will not be left on their own. The Spirit of God himself will be with them, guiding and strengthening them in this task.

Third, this mission comes directly from God. Notice the words Jesus uses. He speaks in the same way the Lord spoke in Isaiah 43:10–12, where God calls Israel to be his witnesses among the nations. Now Jesus applies that language to himself. He is making a great claim—he is God. And his disciples are being called to testify to him, the risen and exalted Lord of all.

> [!important]+ Reflect and Respond
And here is the wonderful news: that mission did not end with those first disciples. Because they obeyed, the gospel has spread across the world. It has even come to you, centuries later, in a different land and culture. Give thanks that Jesus entrusted this mission to his people, and that through their witness you now know the way of salvation in him.
