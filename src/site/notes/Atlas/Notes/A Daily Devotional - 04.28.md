登上巅峰不易，但要稳固其位则更难。大卫是神所拣选的君王，他的王位受到神的保护与赐福。然而，这并不意味着他的统治一帆风顺，总有挑战者想要夺取他的王位。

押沙龙的叛乱刚刚被平息，另一个野心勃勃的人便崛起，企图篡夺大卫的王位，并赢得以色列民的忠诚。他的名字是示巴，被圣经称为“匪徒”（撒下 20:1）。他煽动叛乱，吸引了北方以色列支派的一些支持者。可见，他颇具个人魅力，能使人追随他。

然而，犹大人仍忠于大卫。尽管如此，示巴的叛乱再次动摇了国土的稳定。约押和他的兄弟亚比筛率领军队奋力追捕示巴，最终将他围困在亚比拉城。约押本想攻陷整座城池，只为捉拿示巴，然而，一位聪慧的妇人站出来阻止了他。她忠于神的子民与神的君王，劝服城民不值得为示巴而牺牲整座城池。最终，百姓决定交出示巴，将他的首级砍下，抛给约押。就这样，叛乱瞬间平息，众人各自归家。

面对这段充满背叛、叛乱与杀戮的经文，我们该如何思考呢？我们需要超越事件本身，看到更宏大的图景。虽然神并不认可大卫手下所行的一切，但祂依然掌管一切，确保大卫的统治得以延续。示巴并不是第一个挑战神所立之王的人，也不会是最后一个。但无论是谁，神都不会让大卫的王位被夺走。神掌管万有，祂必信守承诺，在大卫的一生中保守他的王国。

> [!important]+ 反思与回应
作为信徒，我们被呼召坚定地跟随耶稣，但这并不意味着我们要亲自为祂争战。我们需要做的，是持守信心，紧握神的话语，并相信基督始终坐在宝座上，位于神父的右边。今日，让我们向神祈求力量，使我们在主再来时，仍能忠心地持守信仰，矢志不渝。

### <center>King of the Hill</center>

> [!question]+ Review
> 1. Why did David’s army strongly oppose his decision to go into battle? How did their words reflect their loyalty?
> 2. How does Absalom’s fate demonstrate the consequences of rebelling against God’s anointed king? What is ironic about his death?
> 3. Why did David weep after his victory? What inner struggles does this reveal about him?

📖 **Passage to read**: ==2 Samuel 20==

> [!info]- 🎙️Audio: [A Daily Devotional - 04.28 - EN]()  

It’s hard to reach the top, but staying there is even harder. David was God’s chosen king, and his reign was under God’s protection and blessing. But that didn’t mean life was easy. There was always someone trying to take his throne.

Not long after Absalom’s rebellion was crushed, another challenger rose up, trying to steal both the throne and the loyalty of God’s people. His name was Sheba, described as a “worthless man” (20:1). Sheba led a rebellion against David, gathering a following from the northern tribes of Israel. He must have been a persuasive leader to convince so many to follow him.

But while many from Israel turned to Sheba, the men of Judah remained loyal to David. Even so, Sheba’s rebellion put the kingdom at risk once again. Joab and his brother Abishai led a determined pursuit to track him down, eventually cornering him in the city of Abel. Joab, ready to destroy the entire city just to get Sheba, was stopped by a wise woman who lived there. She was loyal to God’s king and God’s people, and she convinced the townspeople that protecting Sheba wasn’t worth the cost. So, they cut off his head and threw it out to Joab. Just like that, the rebellion ended, and everyone went home.

What should we take away from a passage filled with betrayal, rebellion, and bloodshed? We need to see the bigger picture. While God doesn’t approve of everything David’s men do, he is still in control, making sure that David’s reign continues. Sheba wasn’t the first to challenge God’s king, and he wouldn’t be the last. But no matter who tries, God will not let David be overthrown. God is sovereign, and he will keep his promise to protect David’s kingdom during his lifetime.

> [!important]+ Reflect and Respond
As believers, we are called to stand firm for Jesus, but we don’t have to fight his battles for him. Instead, we are called to keep believing in him, hold tightly to his word, and trust that he remains on the throne, seated at the right hand of God the Father. Pray today for the strength to stay faithful and loyal to him until he comes.
