### <center>为祂荣耀的名而赞美</center>

> [!info]- 🎙️Audio: [None]()


《但以理书》第六章提醒我们一个极其清楚的真理：神始终在为祂子民的益处和祂圣名的荣耀而成就一切——即便在被掳之地。祂没有忘记祂的子民，也没有停止向列国显明祂是谁。

此时，波斯王大利乌已经坐在巴比伦的宝座上。他击败了曾受但以理服事的伯沙撒。大利乌很快就看出但以理的智慧与恩赐，于是将他升到极高的职位，权柄遍及全国。然而，这样的尊荣却引起其他首领极大的嫉妒。他们合谋设计，利用大利乌的骄傲，引诱他颁布禁令，命令全国百姓只可向王祈求。
但以理却毫不妥协，他依然坚持向神祷告，甚至在家中窗前公开跪下祈祷，让人都能看见。

当但以理因违背禁令而被控告时，大利乌心中极其忧愁。但即使是君王，他也无法收回自己的命令。但以理因此被投入狮子坑。大利乌临别时，只能无力地说一句：“愿你所常事奉的神救你！”但他心中并不指望这会发生。

然而，神正要向大利乌和全巴比伦显明祂是谁。祂封住了狮子的口，使但以理整夜安然无恙地与猛兽同在。次日，大利乌见但以理平安无事，极其惊奇。随后，这位外邦君王竟颁布诏令，赞美以色列的神。这一章的开始，是王下令百姓只能向他祈求；而到最后，这同一位王却承认耶和华远超世上一切权势。

神对但以理的眷顾，在被掳之中也从未动摇。祂的拯救不仅保护了祂的仆人，也使祂的荣耀藉着外邦君王的口得以传扬。这正是神一直在做的事——祂赐福祂的百姓，同时彰显祂圣名的荣耀。

> [!important]+ 反思与回应
对我们今天而言，神所赐最大的恩典——藉着耶稣基督的救恩与赦罪——同样最能荣耀祂。因为这救恩向世人显明祂的恩典、怜悯与公义。让我们祷告，求主帮助我们在祂美善的计划中安息，并在祂成就世界和我们生命的旨意时，单单信靠祂。

### <center>For the Praise of His Glorious Name</center>

> [!question]+ Review
> 1.⁠ ⁠Why did King Nebuchadnezzar demand that the magicians and wise men first tell the dream itself before interpreting it?
2.⁠ ⁠How did Daniel reveal the mystery of the dream, and to whom did he give all the glory?
3.⁠ ⁠What was Nebuchadnezzar’s response after the dream was revealed, and what lesson can we learn from it?

📖 **Passage to read**: ==Daniel 02==

> [!info]- 🎙️Audio: [None]()  

Daniel 6 reminds us of a simple truth: God is always working for the good of his people and the glory of his name—even in exile. He has not forgotten his people, and he has not stopped showing the nations who he is.

By this time, the Persian king Darius rules Babylon. He has defeated Belshazzar, the king Daniel once served. Darius quickly notices Daniel’s wisdom and gifts, and Daniel rises to a position of great authority, with influence over the whole kingdom. But this promotion stirs up envy among the other leaders. They form a scheme, using Darius’s pride against him. They persuade him to pass a law requiring that everyone pray only to Darius. Daniel, however, refuses to compromise. He continues to pray openly to the Lord, kneeling by the window of his house for all to see.

Darius is troubled when Daniel is accused of breaking the law. Yet even as king, he cannot change what he has decreed. Daniel is thrown into the lions’ den, and Darius can only offer a weak wish that Daniel’s God might rescue him. He certainly does not expect such a thing to happen.

But God is about to show both Darius and Babylon who he truly is. He shuts the mouths of the lions and brings Daniel safely out after a long night in their midst. What follows is remarkable: Darius, a pagan ruler, issues a decree that praises the God of Israel. The chapter begins with a king demanding that people pray to him, and it ends with that same king giving honor to the Lord as greater than any human power.

God’s care for Daniel, even in exile, was never in doubt. And in saving him, God also displayed his glory, even through the voice of a foreign king. This is what God always does—he blesses his people, and he brings honor to his name.

> [!important]+ Reflect and Respond
For us today, the greatest good God gives—salvation and forgiveness through Jesus—also brings him the most glory. It shows the world his grace, mercy, and justice. Ask him to help you rest in this good plan for your life, and to trust his wisdom as he carries out his purposes for the world.
