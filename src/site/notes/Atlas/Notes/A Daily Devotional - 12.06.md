### <center>回应耶稣</center>

> [!info]- 🎙️Audio: [None]()


《希伯来书》显示，耶稣基督是神对他子民在旧约中所有应许的更美、更完全的成全。他是更美的大祭司——为罪的终极献祭。《希伯来书》12:1–2，在某种意义上，是整卷书的结论。**我们应当如何回应耶稣？**

作者首先告诉我们：**我们需要除去罪。**  
这是看见耶稣为我们作救主、赦免我们罪之后的正确回应。如果把这一生比作一场赛跑，那么罪就像重重的负担——一个沉重的背包或金属链条——让我们在为神的荣耀奔跑时受阻。蒙救赎的人被呼召“脱去一切重担，脱去那容易缠累我们的罪”（12:1）。

你今天是否仍在与罪挣扎？也许你甚至不再挣扎，只是继续犯罪！如果是这样，对你的呼召就很清楚：**如果你属于耶稣，你必须除去那位救主为之死的罪。**相信他会赦免你，并求他帮助你在生活中除去罪的重担，为他而活。

但是，基督徒的生活不仅仅是除去罪，虽然这承诺很重要。**基督徒的生活最终是要仰望耶稣！**  
我们如何跑完神所呼召的赛程？如何找到力量，对试探和罪的诱惑说“不”？答案是“仰望耶稣，我们信心的创始成终者”（12:2）。他是那位为我们的赦免和救恩忍受十字架的人。他也是现在坐在神宝座右边、等待将来以能力、荣耀和圣洁审判这世界的人。正是专注于耶稣基督——他的救恩和未来的审判——使我们能在地上为神的荣耀活出美好生活。

> [!important]+ 反思与回应
你生活中是否有需要除去的罪？如果有，就向神倾心告白。求他赐你力量，将罪向他和他人承认，并借着圣灵的能力与之争战。如果你对这个问题还不确定，就求神不断向你显明，你需要在跟随耶稣的过程中，越来越多地除去哪些罪和态度；我们每个人都有这样的地方。

### <center>Responding to Jesus</center>

📖 **Passage to read**: ==Hebrews 12:01-02==

> [!info]- 🎙️Audio: [None]()  

The book of Hebrews shows that Jesus Christ is the better and perfect fulfillment of all God’s Old Testament promises to his people. He is the better priest—the final sacrifice for sin. Hebrews 12:1–2 is in some ways the conclusion of the entire book of Hebrews. How should we respond to Jesus?

The writer tells us that, first, we need to put sin away. That is the right response to seeing Jesus as the Savior who removes our sin and forgives us. If this life is like a race, then sin is like a weight—a heavy backpack or metal chains—that weighs us down as we try to run for the glory of God. The call to redeemed people is to “lay aside every weight, and sin which clings so closely” (12:1). Are you still struggling with sin today? Maybe you’re not even _struggling_ with it; you’re just continuing to do it! If that is the case, the call to you is clear: If you belong to Jesus, you must lay aside the sin for which your Savior died. Trust him to forgive you, and ask him to help you put away the weight of sin in your life as you live for him.

But the Christian life isn’t just about putting sin away, as important as that commitment is. The Christian life is ultimately about looking at Jesus! How do we run the race that God has called us to run? How do we find strength to say no to temptation and the enticing pleasures of sin? By “looking to Jesus, the founder and perfecter of our faith” (12:2). He is the one who endured the cross for our forgiveness and salvation. He is the one who is now seated at the right hand of the throne of God, waiting to return and judge this world in power, glory, and holiness. It is a _focus on Jesus Christ_—his salvation and his future judgment—that will keep us living well for God’s glory on this earth.

> [!important]+ Reflect and Respond
_Is there sin in your life that you need to put aside? If so, talk to God about it. Ask him to give you strength to confess that sin to him and others and to fight it by the power of the Holy Spirit. If you’re not sure about the answer to that question, ask God to continually reveal areas and attitudes of sin that you need to put aside more and more as you follow Jesus; we all have these!_
