### <center>撒母耳的降生</center>

> [!info]- 🎙️Audio: [A Daily Devotional - 04.02 - CN]()

当我们翻开《撒母耳记上》时，我们可能会好奇，那个期待已久的王是否终于来到神的子民中。一个熟悉的圣经主题再次出现：一位不孕的妇女、一个誓言，以及神所赐的神奇怀孕之事。撒母耳的降生预示着：“这个孩子将会非常重要！”

哈拿是以色列的一个敬虔妇女，尽管她一直祈祷并恳求神，却始终无法怀孕。在这个故事中有一个幽默的瞬间，当祭司以利看到哈拿在殿中如此热切地祈祷，以至于他以为她喝醉了！然而，一旦以利明白了她的心意，他就祝福了她。不久之后，神应允了她的祷告：撒母耳诞生了。哈拿遵守自己的誓言，将撒母耳献给神的事工。她和丈夫一同将他带到以利那里，献给神的工作。于是，撒母耳在圣殿中被抚养长大，但他并非成为以色列的王，而是成为了一位祭司。

虽然撒母耳并非以色列人期待的王，但他将成为以色列历史上最伟大的士师。像基甸、耶弗他和参孙一样，他将带领以色列战胜敌人。他将为国家带来和平，正如以前的士师们所做的。然而，与其他士师不同的是，撒母耳没有那些常见的罪性弱点。他将以毫不妥协地遵行神的话语为特征。他的领导将结合祭司、王权和先知职分的元素。撒母耳将充当神与祂的子民之间的中保（作为他们的祭司），领导他们征战和治理（作为他们的王），并向他们传讲神的真理（作为他们的先知）。通过这种方式，撒母耳预示着耶稣基督的三重职分——完全的先知、祭司和王。

> [!important]+ 反思与回应
想一想哈拿——她心碎、沮丧，渴望孩子。神应允了她的祷告，并通过这一行为，不仅祝福了她，也祝福了整个以色列国。她的儿子将成为神子民的伟大领袖。神关心我们生活中的每个细节，今天我们应当为此感谢祂。将你的挣扎、恐惧和疑虑带到祂面前，求祂使用你的生命作为祂伟大计划的一部分。祈祷祂赐福你周围的人，并引导他们信靠那位伟大的王——耶稣。

📖 **Passage to read**: ==1 Samuel 01==

> [!info]- 🎙️Audio: [A Daily Devotional - 04.02 - EN]()  

As we open the book of 1 Samuel, we may wonder if the long-awaited king has finally arrived for God’s people. A familiar biblical theme repeats itself: a barren woman, a vow, and a miraculous birth given by God. The story of Samuel’s birth signals, “This child will be important!”

Hannah, a godly woman in Israel, is unable to have children, despite her constant prayers and pleas to God. There’s a rather humorous moment when the priest, Eli, sees Hannah praying so passionately in the temple that he assumes she must be drunk! But once Eli understands her heart, he blesses her, and soon after, God answers her prayer: Samuel is born. True to her vow, Hannah gives Samuel to the Lord’s service. Together with her husband, she brings him to Eli, dedicating him to the Lord’s work. And so, Samuel is raised up in the temple, but not as a king—rather, as a priest. 

While Samuel will not be the king Israel expects, he will become the greatest judge the nation has ever known. Like Gideon, Jephthah, and Samson, he will lead Israel to victory over their enemies. He will bring peace to the land, just as the previous judges had. But unlike the other judges, Samuel will not be plagued by the same sinful weaknesses. He will be marked by an unwavering obedience to God’s word. His leadership will combine elements of priesthood, kingship, and prophecy. Samuel will serve as a mediator between God and His people (as their priest), lead them in battle and governance (as their king), and speak God’s truth to them (as their prophet). In this way, Samuel will point forward to Jesus Christ, who will perfectly embody these three roles—prophet, priest, and king.

> [!important]+ Reflect and Respond
Consider Hannah for a moment—heartbroken, discouraged, and longing for a child. God answered her prayer, and in doing so, He blessed not only her but the whole nation of Israel. Her son would become a great leader for God’s people. God cares deeply about the details of our lives, and we can be thankful for that today. Take your struggles, fears, and doubts to Him, and ask Him to use your life as part of His grand plan. Pray that He would bless those around you and lead them to faith in the great King, Jesus.
