### <center>罪祭</center>

> [!info]- 🎙️Audio: [A Daily Devotional - 02.12 - CN]()


《利未记》第四章是关于神为祂的子民设立的关于罪的指示。此章详细讲解了罪祭的规定—当以色列民中有人无意犯了罪，违背了神的命令，或者没有做应当做的事时，他们就需要献上这样的祭物。阅读圣经的一个美好之处在于，那位曾经在摩西时代治理以色列的神，今天依然是我们所敬拜的神；我们可以通过《利未记》了解这位神的伟大。

在《利未记》第四章中，我们可以看到一个重要的教训。这个教训关于罪的本质和后果。你或许会问：为什么神如此看重罪？神的子民犯的罪真的是那么严重吗？这些问题的答案就藏在神给摩西的指示细节中。对于这些罪祭，神告诉摩西要宰杀祭物，然后让大祭司做一件可能对我们来说有些奇怪的事：大祭司要“把指头蘸血，在耶和华面前，把血撒在圣所的幔子前七次”（4:6, 17）。这是什么意思呢？

圣所的幔子是神圣洁的敬拜之地与神的同在之间的隔断。当神的子民犯罪时，他们玷污了神的圣洁。在他们当中，罪不仅是对彼此的冒犯，更是对这位圣洁神的亵渎，它使神的圣殿和所有的敬拜物品因罪而不洁、玷污。

罪并不仅仅是犯了错误，或者离神的完美计划稍有偏差。罪是对这位无限圣洁的神的严重冒犯。这段经文还帮助我们理解耶稣的必要性。正如以色列人需要用血来洁净他们的圣所，去除罪的污秽一样，我们也需要借着耶稣的宝血，才能与这位圣洁的神建立真正的关系。

> [!important]+ 反思与回应
我们的罪需要通过血与祭物才能得到赦免。这正是为什么神的儿子耶稣来到世上，为我们的罪而死！今天，再次感谢神为耶稣所做的一切，承认自己的罪，并藉着祂宝贵的血，信靠祂赦免我们的罪。

### <center>Sin Offerings</center>

> [!question]+ Review
> 1.⁠ ⁠Why did God command the Israelites to offer burnt offerings and sprinkle blood on the altar? What truth about sin and holiness does this convey?
> 2.⁠ ⁠In Leviticus 1, why does God refer to the aroma of the burnt offerings as "a pleasing aroma"? How is this related to the consequences of sin?
> 3.⁠ ⁠How can we understand the sacrificial system in Leviticus through Jesus' ultimate sacrifice? How does Jesus' statement "It is finished" on the cross affect our understanding of the need for sacrifices?

📖 **Passage to read**: ==Leviticus 04:1-31==

> [!info]- 🎙️Audio: [A Daily Devotional - 02.12 - EN]()  

Leviticus 4 is all about God's instructions for His people when it comes to sin. The chapter provides clear guidance on sin offerings—sacrifices given when people within the community unintentionally sinned against God, whether by breaking a commandment or failing to do something they should have. One of the great things about reading the Bible is that the same God who ruled over the Israelites in Moses' time is still the same God who rules over us today. We can learn so much about Him through the book of Leviticus.

In Leviticus 4, an important lesson is emerging for us. It’s a lesson about the nature of sin and its consequences. You might wonder, why does God take sin so seriously? Does the sin of God's people really do something so bad? The answer to these questions is found in the details of the instructions God gives to Moses. For the sin offerings, God tells Moses to kill the animal and then have the high priest do something that may seem strange to us: the high priest is to “dip his finger in the blood and sprinkle part of the blood seven times before the LORD in front of the veil of the sanctuary” (4:6, 17). What does this mean?
The veil of the sanctuary was the barrier between the holy place of worship and God’s presence and the sinful people of Israel. When God’s people sin, they defile the holiness of God’s presence among them. Their sin isn’t just against each other; it’s an offense against a holy God, and it makes the objects and places of worship unclean, stained by sin.

Sin isn’t just about making mistakes or falling a little short of God’s perfect plan. Sin is a serious offense against an infinitely holy God. This passage also helps us understand why Jesus was needed. Just as the Israelites had to cleanse their worship space with blood to purify it from the stain of sin, so we need the cleansing blood of Jesus to be in a real relationship with a holy God.

> [!important]+ Reflect and Respond
Our sin requires blood and sacrifice to be forgiven. That’s exactly why Jesus, God’s Son, came to die! Thank God today for Jesus, confessing your sin and trusting in His forgiveness through the cleansing blood of His Son.
