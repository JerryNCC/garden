你是怎样看待神的呢？如果我们不加留意，在阅读像以赛亚这样的书卷时，可能会产生误解。因为其中有许多关于审判的经文，我们或许会以为神是那种急于刑罚的严厉审判者。然而，这并非神的全貌。随着以赛亚书接近尾声，我们看到一个更加温柔、真实的画面：神向祂百姓所怀的心肠。那么，神真正想要赐给祂所爱的人是什么呢？

神愿意他们得着祂的救恩，并与祂建立亲密的关系。请听祂藉着以赛亚所说的话：“素来没有访问我的，我叫他们遇见；没有寻找我的，我向他们显现；我对那称为非我名下的国说：‘我在这里，我在这里。’我整天伸手招呼悖逆的百姓。”（65:1–2）这是一幅神向人张开双臂、愿被寻见的画面——即使那些原本并未寻找祂的人，祂也乐意施恩。只要他们愿意谦卑归向祂，祂随时预备施行赦免。

但以色列民并没有以爱和信靠来回应神。他们抗拒，选择自己的道路，背弃神的言语与慈爱。他们因骄傲和刚硬惹动神的忿怒，因此审判成为必要之事。

然而，即便如此，以赛亚并未让我们陷入绝望。他再次提醒我们：神的恩典仍在。神不会将所有人灭尽，也不会永远撇弃祂的百姓。祂要拯救余民——那真正属于祂的人。是的，那些持续悖逆的人必遭审判，但那些凭信心归向神的人，将要得着救恩。

以赛亚书的结尾展现出将来荣耀的异象：神的子民被召聚在祂的圣山上，敬拜祂，与主同享完全的团契。

我们的神向来有无限的忍耐、怜悯和慈爱。借着耶稣的受死，神为我们的罪开辟了最终的救赎之路，使我们得以永远与祂同住，在新天新地中享受永恒的生命。这就是我们所事奉的神。

> [!important]+ 反思与回应
所以，向祂祷告吧，再一次为我们在基督里所得的赦免感谢祂。

### <center>Ready to Be Found</center>

> [!question]+ Review
> 1. ⁠How does Isaiah describe the servant’s appearance and how people treated him? Why is this different from what we usually expect in a "victorious" figure?
> 2. What is the significance of the idea of "substitution" in the passage? Why did the servant willingly suffer for the sins of others?
> 3. How do you personally respond to what this servant has done for you? In your daily life, how are you willing to follow this suffering Savior more deeply?

📖 **Passage to read**: ==Isaiah 65==

> [!info]- 🎙️Audio: [None]()  

How do you think about God? If we’re not careful, reading through a book like Isaiah can start to give us the wrong impression. With so many passages focused on judgment, we might begin to think of God as some kind of harsh judge, eager to punish. But that’s not the full picture. As we near the end of Isaiah, we see something much more comforting and true: the heart of God for his people. So, what does God truly want for those he loves?

God wants them to know his salvation and live in close relationship with him. Listen to what he says through Isaiah: “I was ready to be sought by those who did not ask for me; I was ready to be found by those who did not seek me. I said, ‘Here I am, here I am,’ to a nation that was not called by my name. I spread out my hands all the day to a rebellious people” (65:1–2). That’s a picture of a God who is reaching out—arms open wide—even to those who don’t look for him. He’s ready to be found, ready to forgive, if they will only turn to him with humble hearts.

But the people of Israel didn’t respond with love or trust. They resisted. They chose their own way. They turned away from his word and his kindness. They stirred up God’s anger with their pride and stubbornness. That’s why judgment had to come.

Yet even then, Isaiah doesn’t leave us in despair. He reminds us again that God’s grace remains. God won’t wipe out everyone. He won’t walk away from his people for good. He will save a remnant—a group who truly belong to him. Yes, judgment will fall on those who keep rejecting him, but salvation will come to those who return to him in faith.

Isaiah ends with a glimpse of what’s to come: a picture of God’s people, gathered together on his holy mountain, worshiping him and enjoying perfect fellowship with their Lord.

> [!important]+ Reflect and Respond
God has always been full of patience, mercy, and kindness. And in Jesus’ death, God has provided the final answer to our sin—the way to live with him forever in the new heaven and new earth. That’s the God we serve. So talk to him. Thank him again for the forgiveness we have through Christ.
