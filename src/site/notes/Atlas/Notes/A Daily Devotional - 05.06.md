### <center>圣殿</center>

> [!info]- 🎙️Audio: [A Daily Devotional - 05.06 - CN]()

经过了多年在旷野中的漂泊，经历了多位士师的兴衰，以及大卫王朝的建立，终于到了所罗门为神的敬拜建造圣殿的时刻。这座宏伟的建筑和建造它的君王给我们带来了宝贵的启示。

首先，值得注意的是，所罗门在建造圣殿时，十分遵循神的律法。许多年前，神已经为祂的子民预定了建殿的计划和所需的材料。例如，《出埃及记》20章25节就记载了神对祂子民的命令，指示他们所建的祭坛，必须使用未曾被金属工具雕刻的石块。所罗门对神话语中的这些命令极为重视，正如《列王纪上》6章7节所记载的那样。

其次，我们要记得，这座圣殿是神同祂的百姓同在的象征。从许多方面来说，它是神与以色列百姓相遇的地方——一个敬拜、宣讲神话语和献祭的场所。事实上，神在所罗门建造这座圣殿时，向他许下了伟大的应许：“你所建的这座殿，若你遵行我的律例，谨守我的命令，行在其中，我必坚立我与你的约，永不离弃以色列民。”（《列王纪上》6:12-13）虽然神的同在并不依赖于伟大的圣殿，但这座圣殿却将成为神同祂子民同在的重要提醒。

然而，这段经文延续至《列王纪上》7:1是有原因的；这一节告诉我们，所罗门花了十三年的时间建造自己的宫殿，而神的圣殿却只用了七年的时间。是的，所罗门为百姓建造了一座宏伟的圣殿，用以敬拜神，但他却花费了更多的时间在自己的宫殿上。这似乎透露出所罗门王身上存在一个问题——一个可能影响他将整个心思专注于敬拜唯一真神的难题。

> [!important]+ 反思与回应
这座所罗门建造的壮丽圣殿为神的百姓提供了重要的意义，但它最终指向了一个更伟大的神与罪人相遇的地方：耶稣基督的身体。反思所罗门对自己宫殿的执着，看看你自己的心。求神显明你是否有分裂的心，或者你是否在生活中完全献身于神的事工、赞美与敬拜。

### <center>The Temple</center>

> [!question]+ Review
> 1. Why does 1 Kings 3 show Solomon asking for wisdom instead of selfish desires? What qualities of Solomon are reflected in this request?
> 2. How does God demonstrate His wisdom and justice through Solomon’s judgment in the story of the two women? What was the impact of this wisdom on the people at that time?
> 3. In this passage, we see Solomon’s ideal reign offering hope to God’s people, yet it also points to the need for an eternal King. As Christians today, how can we live out our total devotion and worship to Jesus?

📖 **Passage to read**: ==1 Kings 06:01-07:01==

> [!info]- 🎙️Audio: [A Daily Devotional - 05.06 - EN]()  

After years of wandering in the wilderness, the rise and fall of various judges, and the establishment of the Davidic monarchy, the time had finally arrived for Solomon to build a house for the worship of God—the temple. This remarkable structure, along with the king who constructed it, provides us with valuable lessons.

First, it's important to observe that Solomon built the temple with careful attention to God's commands. The plans for the temple and the materials to be used had been established many years prior. For example, Exodus 20:25 instructs the people that altars must not be constructed using stones cut with metal tools. Solomon followed these instructions meticulously, as seen in 1 Kings 6:7.

Second, the temple was more than just a building; it symbolized God’s presence among His people. It became the focal point for worship, communication, and sacrifice. God made a significant promise to Solomon in light of the temple’s construction: "Concerning this house that you are building, if you will walk in my statutes and obey my rules and keep all my commandments and walk in them, then I will establish my word with you… and will not forsake my people Israel" (1 Kings 6:12–13). While God's presence is not confined to any structure, this temple would stand as a constant reminder to the people of God’s nearness to them.

However, the passage continues into 1 Kings 7:1 for a reason. This verse tells us that Solomon spent thirteen years constructing his own palace, whereas the temple took only seven years to complete. While Solomon did build a magnificent temple for the worship of God, he devoted much more time and effort to his own personal residence. This contrast raises a potential concern about Solomon’s divided attention, suggesting a problem in his wholehearted devotion to God’s work.

> [!important]+ Reflect and Respond
Ultimately, while the temple served a vital purpose for the people of Israel, it pointed forward to something far greater—the coming of Jesus Christ, the true meeting place between God and sinful humanity. Reflecting on Solomon’s focus on his own palace, consider your own heart. Do you have a divided focus, or are you wholly devoted to serving, praising, and worshiping God in every area of your life? Ask God to help you examine your devotion to Him and seek His guidance in maintaining an undivided heart.
