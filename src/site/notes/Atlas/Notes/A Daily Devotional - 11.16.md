### <center>每一份属灵的祝福</center>

> [!info]- 🎙️Audio: [None]()


在感恩节，许多家庭都会分享彼此的感恩之情。叔叔、阿姨、兄弟、姐妹、祖父母，常会提到健康、家庭、食物和朋友。这些都是美好的，也确实值得感恩。可我们又有多久，真正停下来思考在基督耶稣里所拥有的巨大属灵祝福呢？保罗在给以弗所教会的信开篇，就把焦点放在这些祝福上。那么，这些祝福究竟是什么？它们对我们又意味着什么呢？

首先，我们蒙福是因为神拣选了我们。这正是圣经最清楚教导“拣选”或“预定论”的地方。保罗写道，基督徒蒙福，因为神“按着自己的旨意，预定我们借着耶稣基督得儿子的名分”（1:5），并且这决定是在“创立世界以前”（1:4）就已定下。如果你信靠耶稣为救主，这意味着神早在你尚未出生之前，就拣选你成为祂的儿女。这是何等深厚的祝福！

其次，我们蒙福是因为通过耶稣基督的十字架得着救赎和赦免。记住：我们的救赎是借着耶稣的血成就的。我们的救恩不是廉价的，它是通过基督的工作买来的。这正显示神将恩典丰丰富富地赐给像你我这样的罪人。

第三，我们蒙福是因为在耶稣里有永远的产业等候我们。属于耶稣意味着我们有未来，我们将与救主共享永恒的家。而且，神赐下圣灵住在我们心中，作为这份产业的凭据。天堂就在前方，圣灵在我们生命中的同在，是神向我们所立的保证：我们必定会抵达那荣耀的家。

> [!important]+ 反思与回应
生活中还有许多小小的祝福值得感恩，我们应当怀着感恩之心去赞美神。但最重要的是，我们要为信靠耶稣基督所带来的永恒祝福而感谢祂——祂是神的儿子。赞美神，感谢祂按自己的主权拣选了你；感谢祂在基督里施行的救赎之恩；并祈求祂帮助你信靠圣灵在你心中的同在，作为你与耶稣永恒同在的保证。

### <center>Every Spiritual Blessing</center>

> [!question]+ Review

📖 **Passage to read**: ==Ephesians 01.01-14==

> [!info]- 🎙️Audio: [None]()  

At Thanksgiving, many families take time to share what they are thankful for. Aunts, uncles, brothers, sisters, and grandparents often mention health, family, food, and friends. That is all good and right. It is proper to remember our blessings. But how often do we pause to think about the immense spiritual blessings we have in Christ Jesus? Paul begins his letter to the church at Ephesus by focusing on these very blessings. What are these blessings, and what do they mean for us?

First, we are blessed because God chose us. This is where the Bible teaches the doctrine of election or predestination most clearly. Paul writes that Christians are blessed because God “predestined [us] for adoption” (1:5), doing so “before the foundation of the world” (1:4). If you have trusted in Jesus as your Savior, this means that God chose you long before you were born to be His child. That is a profound blessing!

Second, we are blessed through redemption and forgiveness, made possible by the cross of Jesus Christ. Remember this: your redemption comes through the blood of Jesus. Your salvation was not cheap; it was purchased through Christ’s work. This is God lavishing His grace upon sinners like you and me.

Third, we are blessed with a future inheritance in Jesus that will last forever. Belonging to Jesus means we are going somewhere. We will share an eternal home with our Savior. Moreover, God has given His Holy Spirit to dwell in us as a guarantee of this inheritance. Heaven is coming, and the Spirit’s presence in our hearts is God’s promise that we will reach that glorious home.

> [!important]+ Reflect and Respond
There are many smaller blessings to thank God for, and we should do so with gratitude. But above all, we should be thankful for the eternal and infinite blessings we have through faith in Jesus Christ, the Son of God. Praise God for His sovereign choice of you. Thank Him for the gracious work of redemption. And ask Him to help you trust His Spirit, the guarantee of your future life with Jesus forever.
