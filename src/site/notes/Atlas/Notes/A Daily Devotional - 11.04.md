### <center>教会的不合一</center>

> [!info]- 🎙️Audio: [None]()


若你是运动迷，你一定体会过当球队迎来一位极具天赋的新秀时，那份激动与期待。所有人都充满盼望，这名球员似乎潜力无限！然而，光有天赋并不代表成熟。真正的成熟，是在漫长的赛季里，在无数次的对抗与磨炼中，渐渐养成的。这样的画面，正好帮助我们理解古代哥林多城的教会。

保罗曾在宣教旅程中建立了这间教会。它充满活力，成长迅速，也拥有许多恩赐丰富的信徒。正因如此，保罗在书信开头先感谢上帝赐给他们的恩典。然而，这群才华洋溢的信徒，就像一支满是潜力却缺乏纪律的新球队——他们仍然幼嫩，灵命尚未成熟。

在这间恩赐众多却不够成熟的教会中，最大的问题之一就是**分裂**。信徒之间出现了不同的派系，彼此争论不休。保罗一开始便直面此事：“弟兄们，我藉着我们主耶稣基督的名劝你们，都说一样的话，你们中间也不可分党，只要一心一意，彼此相合。”（哥林多前书1:10）有人说：“我是属保罗的”，有人说：“我是属彼得（矶法）的”，还有人说：“我是属亚波罗的。”甚至有人自以为更属灵，说：“我是属基督的。”然而，这种态度正显出他们的属灵幼稚。

那保罗的解决之道是什么呢？他呼吁他们回到福音的核心。**一个福音，一位基督，一座十字架。**他反问道：“基督是分开的吗？”（1:13）保罗提醒他们，他所传的正是“钉十字架的基督”（1:23）。这信息本应使信徒合一，而非分裂。哥林多教会忘记了这一点。因此，在整封信里，保罗一再重申同一个真理——那使人得救的福音，也是使教会合一的福音。

我们也能从哥林多教会身上看见自己。许多人有恩赐，却仍需在基督里成长。我们的才能有时让我们骄傲，使我们比较、争竞，而非谦卑服事。因此，让我们祈求上帝，光照我们心中那属灵不成熟的角落——或许正如哥林多人一样。求主帮助我们在各方面都长进，在救主基督里更加成熟。

> [!important]+ 反思与回应
因为，教会的根基并非建在人的名声或喜好上，而是建在十字架上。唯有当我们重新记起这一点，真正的合一才会临到。

### <center>Church Disunity</center>

> [!question]+ Review
> 


📖 **Passage to read**: ==1 Corinthians 01==

> [!info]- 🎙️Audio: [None]()  

If you’ve ever followed sports, you know how exciting it is when your favorite team signs a new, gifted rookie. Everyone has high hopes. The player’s potential seems limitless! But as any coach will tell you, raw talent is not the same as maturity. Maturity takes time. It comes through testing, teamwork, and experience on the field. That image gives us a good way to think about the church in the city of Corinth.

Paul had planted this church during one of his missionary journeys. It was full of energy and spiritual life. It was also full of gifted people—so many that Paul began his letter by thanking God for how He had blessed them. Yet, like a young team with lots of talent but little discipline, the Corinthian church still had much to learn. It was far from mature.

One of the biggest problems in this young, gifted church was disunity. The people were divided, and not just into two groups—there were factions everywhere. Paul faced this issue head-on: _“I appeal to you … that all of you agree, and that there be no divisions among you”_ (1 Corinthians 1:10). Some believers were lining up behind different leaders—“I follow Paul,” “I follow Cephas,” or “I follow Apollos.” Others tried to sound more spiritual by claiming, “I follow Christ.” But this attitude only showed how immature they still were.

So what was Paul’s solution? He pointed them back to the gospel. One message. One Savior. One cross. He asked them a piercing question: _“Is Christ divided?”_ (1:13). The gospel Paul preached to them was _“Christ crucified”_ (1:23). That message was meant to unite believers, not tear them apart. The Corinthians had lost sight of that. Throughout this letter, Paul keeps reminding them of the same truth—the gospel that saves us is also the gospel that unites us.

We can see ourselves in this story. Like the Corinthians, many of us are gifted, but we still need to grow in Christlike maturity. Sometimes our gifts make us proud instead of humble. They make us compete instead of serve. So pray that God would show you where pride or division may live in your heart. Ask Him to help you grow up in every way into Christ, your Savior and Lord.

> [!important]+ Reflect and Respond
Because in the end, the church is not built on personalities or preferences—it’s built on the cross. And when we remember that, unity will follow.
