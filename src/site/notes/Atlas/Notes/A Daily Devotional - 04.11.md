### <center>出人意料的王</center>

> [!info]- 🎙️Audio: [A Daily Devotional - 04.11 - CN]()

我们总是喜欢那些从无名到成名的不太可能的英雄——他们往往因为谦卑、正直，有时也因为一点好运而崭露头角。大卫的故事正是这样的一个例子。虽然扫罗看起来是最合适的王选，但大卫却是一个最不可能领导以色列的人。他是家中最小的一个，牧羊在田野中，生活在他那些强壮英俊的哥哥们的阴影下。然而，神却选择了他来做祂的百姓的领袖。

在《撒母耳记上》第16章的开头，我们看到即使是神的先知撒母耳也曾陷入人们的思维方式。神呼召撒母耳从耶西的儿子中间膏立一位新王。当撒母耳到达时，他立刻被耶西的儿子的外貌所吸引。当他看到以利押时，他心里想：“耶和华的受膏者定是在他面前”（16:6）。这正是百姓当初选择扫罗时的想法。扫罗身材高大英俊，看起来就像个王。然而，正如我们所知，他的心并不合神的心意。神温和地提醒撒母耳：“不要看他的外貌，也不要看他身材高大，因为我已经弃绝了他。耶和华不像人看人，人看外貌，耶和华却看内心”（16:7）。即使是撒母耳，也需要被提醒，神的眼光远超外在的表现。

当撒母耳膏立大卫时——这让耶西和他的其他儿子都感到惊讶——大卫开始在神的圣灵帮助下逐渐成长、茁壮。随着章节的展开，大卫的崛起也开始了。他进入了扫罗的服侍，扫罗已经陷入了罪恶、疯狂和愤怒的深渊。大卫从一名牧羊人开始，凭着他美妙的竖琴演奏，成为扫罗内心痛苦的唯一安慰。到《撒母耳记上》16章结束时，大卫从田野的牧羊人，走进了王宫的殿堂。神为祂的百姓选择了一个王——一个出人意料的王。

> [!important]+ 反思与回应
今天，记住神看的是人的内心，而不仅仅是外在的表现。神希望你成为一个顺服祂话语、跟随祂儿子的人，且这种顺服和跟随在你生活中有所体现。感谢神祂看的是你的心，而不是外表。然后，祈祷你能像神看待他人一样看待他们。

### <center>The King No One Expected</center>

> [!question]+ Review
> 1.  ⁠Why did Saul fail to completely destroy the Amalekites when carrying out God's command? What were his failures in obeying God's command?
> 2. How does Samuel respond to Saul's excuses, and what qualities does God expect Saul's obedience to demonstrate?
> 3. The article highlights that God values obedience over sacrifice. How can we demonstrate our obedience to God in our daily lives?

📖 **Passage to read**: ==1 Samuel 16==

> [!info]- 🎙️Audio: [A Daily Devotional - 04.11 - EN]()  

We love stories about unlikely heroes—people who start in obscurity and rise to fame, often because of their humility, integrity, and sometimes just a bit of luck. David’s story is a perfect example of this. While Saul seemed like the obvious choice for a king, David was the least likely person to lead Israel. He was the youngest in his family, out in the fields tending sheep, and overshadowed by his older brothers who were strong and handsome. Yet, God chose him to be the leader of His people.

At the beginning of 1 Samuel 16, we see that even Samuel, a prophet of God, struggled with seeing things as the people did. God called Samuel to anoint a new king from the sons of Jesse. When Samuel arrived, he was immediately struck by the outward appearance of Jesse’s sons. When he saw Eliab, he thought, “Surely the Lord’s anointed is before him” (16:6). This was the same thinking the people had when they chose Saul. Saul was tall, handsome, and seemed like a king. But, as we know, his heart was not aligned with God’s. God gently reminded Samuel, saying, “Do not look on his appearance or the height of his stature, because I have rejected him. For the Lord sees not as man sees: man looks on the outward appearance, but the Lord looks on the heart” (16:7). Samuel, even though a prophet, needed to be reminded that God’s view goes deeper than what we can see on the outside.

After Samuel anointed David—much to the surprise of Jesse and his brothers—David began to grow in wisdom and strength, empowered by the Spirit of God. As the chapter progresses, David’s rise to prominence begins. He enters the service of King Saul, who has spiraled into sin, madness, and rage. David, who had started out as a shepherd, begins to serve Saul by playing the harp so beautifully that it calms Saul’s troubled mind. By the end of 1 Samuel 16, David goes from the fields with sheep to the court of the king. God had chosen a king for His people—a king that no one expected.

> [!important]+ Reflect and Respond
Today, remember that God looks at the heart of a person, not just their outward appearance. He wants you to be someone who obeys His word and follows His Son in a way that reflects in your life. Thank God that He sees your heart, not just what’s on the outside. Then, pray that you would see others as God sees them.
