### <center>悔改吧！</center>

> [!info]- 🎙️Audio: [None]()

在以色列地，有一件不寻常的事正在发生。一个先知出现了——他身穿粗布，住在旷野，以蝗虫和野蜜为食。许多人蜂拥而至去看他。马太告诉我们：“那时，耶路撒冷和犹太全地，并约旦河一带地方的人，都出去到约翰那里”（太3:5）。这位先知就是施洗的约翰。他的使命是指向弥赛亚。马太强调，约翰正应验了先知玛拉基的预言：必有一人在旷野呼喊，预备主的道路。约翰的信息并不复杂，却极其庄重有力：“天国近了，你们应当悔改！”（太3:2）。君王要来了，人必须离弃罪恶，预备迎见祂。

自然，人们心里会疑惑：这人是谁呢？难道他就是弥赛亚？他的事工大有影响，从四面八方的人都来跟随他。但约翰没有让人误会。他明确指出，自己不是弥赛亚。他的使命只是为耶稣预备道路。约翰清楚宣告：“我是用水给你们施洗，叫你们悔改。但那在我以后来的，能力比我更大，我就是给他提鞋也不配；他要用圣灵与火给你们施洗。”（太3:11）有一位比约翰更大的要来——就是耶稣。

当耶稣出现时，却发生了一件令人惊讶的事。祂要求约翰为祂施洗。这实在出乎意料，连约翰自己都惊讶。毕竟，耶稣并不需要悔改。祂是君王，是圣洁的神子！祂为什么要受洗呢？首先，祂是公开肯定约翰的事工，证明他确实是神的先知。其次，祂要与罪人认同。耶稣没有罪，却主动进入水中，表明祂来是要与祂的百姓站在一起，担当他们的罪，带来救恩。

> [!important]+ 反思与回应
那么，你呢？你是否已经悔改——不仅仅是向神说一句“对不起”，而是真心实意地转离罪恶，全心跟随耶稣？若是如此，就祈求神赐恩，使你持守信心，忠心跟随祂。也求神使你像约翰一样，常常将人指向基督——那位为我们而来的救主。

### <center>Repent!</center>

> [!question]+ Review
> 1.⁠ ⁠Why is the birth of Jesus unique in human history?
2.⁠ ⁠How does Matthew show that the birth of Jesus fulfills the promises of the Old Testament prophets?
3.⁠ ⁠What are the two different responses people had toward this King?

📖 **Passage to read**: ==Matthew 03==

> [!info]- 🎙️Audio: [None]()  

Something unusual was taking place in Israel. A prophet had appeared—a man dressed in rough clothing, living in the wilderness, eating locusts and wild honey. Crowds were going out to see him. Matthew tells us that people from Jerusalem, Judea, and the whole region around the Jordan came to hear him (3:5). This prophet was John the Baptist. His task was to point to the Messiah. Matthew shows us that John fulfilled God’s promise through the prophet Malachi, that one would come to prepare the way of the Lord. John’s message was simple but weighty: “Repent, for the kingdom of heaven is at hand” (3:2). The King was coming, and people needed to turn from their sin and be ready for him.

Naturally, the people wondered: Who is this man? Could he be the Messiah himself? His ministry was powerful, and people from everywhere were responding. But John did not leave any room for confusion. He was not the Messiah. His work was to prepare the way for Jesus. John said clearly: “I baptize you with water for repentance, but he who is coming after me is mightier than I, whose sandals I am not worthy to carry. He will baptize you with the Holy Spirit and fire” (3:11). Someone greater was coming—Jesus.

And when Jesus arrived, something surprising happened. He asked John to baptize him. This was unexpected—even for John. After all, Jesus did not need to repent. He is the King, the holy Son of God! Why would he receive baptism? First, to affirm John’s work. By being baptized, Jesus showed that John was truly God’s prophet. Second, to identify himself with sinners. Though Jesus had no sin, he stepped into the water to show that he came to stand with his people, to bear their sin, and to bring them salvation.

> [!important]+ Reflect and Respond
So, how about you? Have you repented—not just saying “sorry” to God, but truly turning from sin to follow Jesus with all your heart? If you have, ask God to help you keep following him faithfully. And ask God to make you like John—always pointing others to Christ, the Savior who came for us.
