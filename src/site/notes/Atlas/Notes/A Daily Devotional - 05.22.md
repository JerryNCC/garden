### <center>耶户的审判</center>

> [!info]- 🎙️Audio: [A Daily Devotional - 05.22 - CN]()

审判是我们在圣经故事中反复遇到的主题。宇宙的圣洁神必定会惩罚罪恶与悖逆，惩罚那些违背祂完美话语的人。神早在多年以前就通过先知向邪恶的亚哈王家族作出过这样的承诺。那么，神是如何实施对亚哈家族的审判呢？通过一个人：耶户。

当我们来到这段经文时，耶户已经杀死了邪恶的亚哈王之妻耶洗别。接着，他开始对亚哈的儿子们采取行动，借着耶斯列的男人们执行对他们的处决。耶户继续执行审判，接着杀害了前任以色列王亚哈谢的一些亲戚。最后，他把注意力转向了仍然在以色列地的巴力先知们。他设下一个陷阱，把他们诱入巴力的殿堂，假装要举行一场偶像的敬拜仪式。一旦他们进入，耶户便命令手下屠杀巴力的祭司，摧毁偶像，拆毁神殿，并将其变为公共厕所。神对罪的审判最终降临到以色列那些邪恶王朝的家族。

一开始，我们或许对耶户抱有希望。他似乎是出于要成就神旨意的动机，他看起来捍卫神的圣洁，顺服神的话语。但是，耶户是因为单纯爱神、敬拜神而执行神的审判吗？遗憾的是，并不是。耶户最终成为了一个例子，尽管他执行了神的审判，但却没有真正将自己的心完全交给神。第29节悲哀地说：“耶户没有离开尼巴的儿子耶罗波安使以色列人犯罪的罪。”虽然耶户显现出对神圣洁的热情和对罪恶的强烈反对，但他的心从未完全顺服神。这对我们每个人来说都是警示！神可以使用任何人来成就祂的旨意；祂甚至可以使用那些心并未完全归向祂的人。被神用来做伟大的事并不代表对祂的忠诚。我们需要在信心、悔改、顺服和爱中，个人地完全归属于神。

> [!important]+ 反思与回应
好行为不能代替一颗完全奉献给神的心，这颗心只有通过悔改和对耶稣基督的信仰才能归给神。今天祈祷，求神帮助你明白这一点。请祂帮助你为祂做伟大的事，同时也帮助你全心全意地爱祂，认识祂。

### <center>Jehu’s Judgment</center>

> [!question]+ Review
> 1. Why was Elisha’s servant initially afraid, and how did Elisha help him change his perspective on the situation?
> 2. Why did God want Elisha’s servant to see His invisible power? What was the significance of this for the servant?
> 3. How can we, today, maintain trust in God and remember that He is always working behind the scenes in times of difficulty?

📖 **Passage to read**: ==2 Kings 10==

> [!info]- 🎙️Audio: [A Daily Devotional - 05.22 - EN]()  

Judgment is a theme we encounter repeatedly as we walk through the story of the Bible. The holy God of the universe will punish sin and rebellion against His perfect Word. God had promised this—through His prophets—to the household of the wicked King Ahab long before. How does God bring judgment upon Ahab’s house? Through one man: Jehu.

By the time we reach this passage, Jehu has already killed Jezebel, the wicked wife of Ahab. He then moves on to Ahab’s sons, executing them with the help of the men of Jezreel. Jehu continues his mission of judgment, going on to execute some of the relatives of the former King Ahaziah. Lastly, he turns his attention to the prophets of Baal who remain in Israel. He sets a trap for them, luring them into the house of Baal under the false pretense of holding a worship service for the idol. Once inside, Jehu has his men slaughter the priests of Baal, destroy the idols, demolish the house, and turn it into a public restroom. God’s judgment against sin is carried out upon the house of the wicked kings of Israel.

At first, we might feel hopeful about King Jehu. He seems motivated by a desire for God’s will to be done. He seems to stand for God’s holiness and obey His Word. But is Jehu doing God’s work of judgment because he loves and worships God alone? Unfortunately, no. Jehu ends up as an example of someone who, while carrying out God’s judgment, does so without truly giving his heart to God. Verse 29 tells us sadly: “Jehu did not turn aside from the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, which he made Israel to sin.” While Jehu’s passion for God’s holiness and his violent opposition to sin are evident, his own heart is never fully devoted to God in obedience. This is a warning for us all! God can use anyone for His purposes; He can even use those whose hearts are not fully His. Being used by God for great things doesn’t guarantee faithfulness to Him. We need to be personally committed to God in faith, repentance, obedience, and love.

> [!important]+ Reflect and Respond
Good deeds are not enough. They cannot replace a heart fully devoted to God, one that is given to Him through repentance and faith in Jesus Christ. Pray today that God would help you understand this. Ask Him to help you do great things for Him, and also to love and know Him with all your heart.
