### <center>公义的日头</center>

> [!info]- 🎙️Audio: [None]()

自从古列王下诏，准许许多以色列人归回本地，已经过去约一百年了。圣殿虽然重新建造，却远不及先前的荣美。以色列人的生活混乱，他们的敬拜也失了次序。虽然他们已回到故土，却似乎仍在学习如何在被掳之后生活。在这样的光景中，神差遣了先知玛拉基。

玛拉基指向将来的日子——那是神荣耀显现的日子，既有审判，也有拯救。他宣告：“那日临近，凡狂傲的和行恶的必如碎稓”（玛拉基书4:1）。然而，这日子并非只有审判。对于敬畏神的人，玛拉基宣告：“公义的日头必出现，其光线有医治之能”（玛拉基书4:2）。在那日，神的百姓要得着生命与医治，就是拯救。神的工作尚未完结，祂仍在施行祂为全地所定的伟大计划。

玛拉基又给百姓一个记号。在那大日来到之前，神必差遣一位先知。“看哪，耶和华大而可畏之日未到以前，我必差遣先知以利亚到你们那里去”（玛拉基书4:5）。他的出现要成为预兆，表明耶和华的日子近了，表明“公义的日头”将要照耀神的百姓。至此，玛拉基书结束。随后是长达四百年的沉默。再没有先知发声。神的百姓在盼望中等候，渴望着弥赛亚的到来。

终于，在路加福音中，玛拉基的话再次回响。一位名叫撒迦利亚的祭司，论到他的儿子时说：“你要行在主的前面，预备他的道路，叫他的百姓因罪得赦，就知道救恩；因我们神怜悯的心肠，叫清晨的日光从高天临到我们”（路加福音1:76–78）。日光已经要来临！施洗约翰登场，指引百姓归向那位能赐下永远救恩的主。

> [!important]+ 反思与回应
这故事也是我们的故事。虽然我们身处其后，却同样进入其中。弥赛亚已经来到，我们蒙召要凭信心顺服祂而活。赞美神，祂并没有让祂的百姓永远等待。感谢祂差遣祂的独生子。并感谢祂，因着耶稣基督的工作，你我也能永远成为神的子民。

### <center>The Sun of Righteousness</center>

> [!question]+ Review
> 1.⁠ ⁠What does the man with the measuring line in Zechariah’s vision represent?
2.⁠ ⁠What does God’s promise to be a “wall of fire” and “the glory within” Jerusalem mean for His people?
3.⁠ ⁠How does this vision point to Jesus Christ and the ultimate hope for all of God’s people?

📖 **Passage to read**: ==Malachi 04==

> [!info]- 🎙️Audio: [None]()  

It had been about a hundred years since Cyrus gave the command that allowed many Israelites to return to their land. The temple was rebuilt, but it was nothing like the glory of the first one. The life of Israel was unsettled, and even worship was in disorder. Though they were back home, it seemed that God’s people were still learning how to live after the exile. Into this moment, God sent the prophet Malachi.

Malachi points them to a coming day—a day of God’s glory, shown both in judgment and in salvation. “The day is coming,” he says, “when all the arrogant and all evildoers will be stubble” (4:1). But this day will not bring only judgment. For those who fear God, Malachi declares, “the sun of righteousness shall rise with healing in its wings” (4:2). For God’s people, the day will bring life and healing. It is salvation. God’s work is not finished; he is carrying out his great plan for the whole world.

Malachi also gives them a sign to look for. Before this great day comes, God will send a prophet. “Behold, I will send you Elijah the prophet before the great and awesome day of the LORD comes” (4:5). His coming will be a signal that the day of the Lord is near. He will show that the “sun of righteousness” is about to rise on God’s people. And then, the book of Malachi closes. Four hundred years of silence follow. No prophets speak. God’s people wait in hope, longing for the day when the Messiah would finally come.

At last, in the Gospel of Luke, Malachi’s words echo again. A priest named Zechariah speaks of his son: “For you will go before the Lord to prepare his ways, to give knowledge of salvation to his people in the forgiveness of their sins, because of the tender mercy of our God, whereby the sunrise shall visit us from on high” (Luke 1:76–78). The sunrise is coming! John the Baptist steps onto the scene, pointing people to the one who will bring eternal salvation.

> [!important]+ Reflect and Respond
This is our story too. We live much later, but we enter the same story. After the Messiah has come, we are called to live by faith and obedience to him. Praise God that he did not leave his people waiting forever. Thank him for sending his Son. And thank him that, because of Jesus Christ, you too belong to his people forever.
