### <center>耶稣大胆的举动</center>

> [!info]- 🎙️Audio: [None]()

路加写这卷福音书，是要为耶稣的一生作有条理的记载，好叫读者提阿非罗确知自己所听见的是真实的。但路加也特别强调一件事：耶稣来的对象，不仅是那些受尊敬、守律法的人，也包括那些被排斥在外的人——外邦人、被视为不洁净的人。路加从一开始就显明，弥赛亚带来的福音是向各类人宣告的。

在公开事奉的起初，耶稣回到自己的家乡拿撒勒。在会堂里，他被请出来诵读圣经。他选择以赛亚书中一段谈到向贫穷人传好消息、宣告“主悦纳人的禧年”（4:19）的经文。然后，他说出令人震惊的话：这预言在他身上应验了。众人都愣住了，他们认识这个人，从小看他长大，一个木匠的儿子怎么能宣称这样的事？

但耶稣并没有停下，他继续指出旧约的两件事：先知以利亚曾被差遣去帮助撒勒法的寡妇；先知以利沙曾医治叙利亚人乃缦。这两人都是外邦人，却因信而蒙神赐福。耶稣引用这些例子，是要清楚地表明：神的恩典并不局限在以色列人中，凡信靠他的人都可以得着祝福。

这话深深刺痛了会众的自尊。他们听见耶稣把自己与伟大的先知相提并论，又宣告神的恩典也临到他们视为不洁的外邦人，心中愤怒难平。他们把耶稣赶出城，甚至想把他推下山崖杀害。

> [!important]+ 反思与回应
路加要我们体会这时的分量。我们也是需要神恩典的罪人，全无可夸的资格。然而，神却在基督里向一切悔改、相信的人赐下救恩——无论是犹太人还是外邦人，内里人还是外人。让我们感恩，因耶稣为像我们这样的人而来，并求神赐下单纯信靠他的心。

### <center>Jesus’s Bold Move</center>

> [!question]+ Review
> 1.⁠ ⁠What details about Jesus’s birth reveal the humility of his arrival?
2.⁠ ⁠Who were the first to hear the news of the Messiah’s birth, and what did the angels proclaim to them?
3.⁠ ⁠How does Jesus’s humble birth point to the way he would accomplish salvation in the future?

📖 **Passage to read**: ==Luke 04.16-30==

> [!info]- 🎙️Audio: [None]()  

Luke writes his Gospel to give an orderly account of Jesus’s life so that his reader, Theophilus, can be sure of what he has heard. But Luke also highlights something striking. Again and again, he shows that Jesus comes not only for the respected and religious, but also for those on the margins—outsiders, Gentiles, and people considered unclean. From the very start, Luke wants us to see that the Messiah brings good news to all kinds of people.

At the beginning of his public ministry, Jesus returns to his hometown of Nazareth. In the synagogue, he is asked to read from Scripture. He chooses a passage from Isaiah that speaks of good news for the poor and the coming of “the year of the Lord’s favor” (4:19). Then he says something astonishing: this prophecy is fulfilled in him. The people are stunned. They know this man. They watched him grow up. How can this hometown carpenter claim such things?

But Jesus presses further. He recalls two Old Testament stories: the widow of Zarephath who was helped by Elijah, and Naaman the Syrian, who was healed by Elisha. Both were Gentiles. Both received God’s blessing through faith. By bringing up these examples, Jesus is making a clear point. God’s grace is not limited to Israel. His blessings reach beyond the Jewish people to anyone who believes.

This offends the crowd. They see Jesus comparing himself to the great prophets and declaring that God’s favor can rest on Gentiles—people they often viewed as unclean. Their pride is wounded, and their anger boils over. They drive Jesus out of town and even try to kill him by throwing him off a cliff.

> [!important]+ Reflect and Respond
Luke wants us to feel the weight of this moment. We too are sinners who need God’s grace. None of us deserves it. Yet God offers salvation in Christ to anyone who repents and believes—Jew or Gentile, insider or outsider. Give thanks that Jesus came for people like us, and ask God for a heart that trusts him completely.
