### <center>上帝的回应</center>

> [!info]- 🎙️Audio: [A Daily Devotional - 06.24 - CN]()

约伯对，还是他的朋友们对？最终，唯有上帝是对的。约伯的朋友们确实说出了上帝的圣洁与对罪的审判，这是正确的；但他们错在无端指控约伯，因约伯实在是忠心敬虔地生活着。而约伯虽然坚持苦难不一定是神审判的记号，这话不错，却也渐渐失了脚步，几近质疑神的心意，怀疑神的计划是否真是良善。此时，上帝亲自出场发言。

我们或许会以为上帝要向约伯解释一切——讲述天上的景象，撒但如何前来挑战约伯的信心，以及上帝为何容许撒但用苦难、损失和疾病来试炼他。但出人意料的是，上帝并没有这样做。祂没有解释，而是连珠发问。因为上帝尚未完成对约伯信心的陶造。约伯虽然忠心，却模糊了上帝全权掌管的视角，心中开始动摇，对上帝美善的旨意生疑。因此，上帝要提醒约伯：祂是谁，约伯是谁。

上帝对约伯说：“你要如勇士束腰，我问你，你可以指示我”（约伯记38:3）。随后，上帝一连提出许多问题：“我立大地根基的时候，你在哪里？”“海水冲出胎胞，那界限是谁划定？”“昼夜更替、日头东升西落，可是你所命令？”“生与死的奥秘，你能明白？”到了第21节，上帝更带着一点幽默调侃他说：“你总知道吧，因为你那时已生，并且你日子甚多！”意指约伯的生命不过转瞬，与那永恒的神相比，何其渺小。

约伯很快就明白了：神是创造主，而人不过是被造物；神的智慧无限，人类的悟性有限。在某个时刻，人必须停止执意追问“为什么”，转而单纯信靠那位全知全能、掌管万有的主宰。

或许我们会觉得上帝对约伯太过严厉。但我们要记得，这一切正是上帝对约伯的回应。这不是愤怒的责备，也不是刑罚的言语，而是天父慈爱的责备。神仿佛在说：“约伯，你要记得我是谁。”祂不是弃绝约伯，而是在用恩典亲自教导祂的仆人，带领他走上正确的信心之路——即便在不明白之中，也仍然信靠神。

> [!important]+ 反思与回应
因此，今天你可以坦然向神倾心吐意，也当祈求祂赐下信心，使你安息在祂慈爱主权的看顾中。求祂使你成为忠心的仆人，深信祂使万事互相效力，叫爱神、跟随耶稣的人得着永恒的益处。

### <center>God’s Response</center>

> [!question]+ Review
> 1. ⁠What did Elihu claim Job said in Job 34:9 that was actually a misrepresentation of Job's real message? What problem does this reveal?
> 2. ⁠Which attributes of God did Elihu rightly acknowledge? Yet in what way did he wrongly apply these truths to Job's situation?
> 3. From Elihu’s example, what can we learn about the difference between spiritual knowledge and spiritual wisdom?

📖 **Passage to read**: ==Job 38==

> [!info]- 🎙️Audio: [A Daily Devotional - 06.24 - EN]()  


Who was right—Job or his friends? In the end, it was God who was right. Job’s friends were right to speak of God’s holiness and his judgment against sin. But they were wrong to accuse Job, because Job had been living faithfully. Job, on the other hand, was right to say that suffering doesn’t always mean God is punishing someone. Still, Job had started to slip. He was getting close to questioning God’s motives and wondering if God really had a good plan. Now it was time for God to speak.

We might expect God to explain everything to Job—to describe the scene in heaven when Satan came to challenge Job’s faith, and how God allowed Satan to test him through suffering. But God doesn’t do that. Instead, he comes with questions—many of them. God isn’t done shaping Job’s faith. Job has walked faithfully, but he’s lost sight of the bigger picture. He’s started to doubt God’s good purpose. So, God steps in to remind Job of who he is—and who Job is.

God tells Job to get ready—to prepare himself for what’s coming (Job 38:3). Then God asks: Were you there when I laid the foundations of the earth? Do you know who set the boundaries for the sea? Can you command the sun to rise and set? Can you explain how life begins—or what happens after death? In verse 21, God even gently teases Job: “Surely you know, since you were born then,” pointing to how short Job’s life is compared to God’s eternal existence.

It doesn’t take long for Job to realize what’s happening. God is the Creator. Job is not. God’s wisdom is without limit. Job’s understanding is small. At some point, Job must stop asking “why?” and start trusting the One who knows the whole story.

Now, before we think God is being too harsh with Job, let’s remember: this is God’s answer to Job. These aren’t angry words. They’re not punishment. They’re the words of a loving Father correcting his child. God is saying, “Job, don’t forget who I am.” He’s not pushing Job away—he’s drawing him closer. He’s helping Job learn what real faith looks like: trusting God even when we don’t have all the answers.

> [!important]+ Reflect and Respond
So today, pray honestly before God—but also pray for trust. Ask him to help you rest in his care and his perfect plan for your life. And ask him to make you his faithful servant, confident that he’s working all things for the eternal good of those who love and follow Jesus.
