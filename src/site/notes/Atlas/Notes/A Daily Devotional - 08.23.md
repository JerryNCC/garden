### <center>永远的婚约</center>

> [!info]- 🎙️Audio: [None]()


在这个世界上，我们常常见到婚姻的破裂。但在这里，我们看见一桩神永不容许结束的婚姻——就是祂与那不忠百姓所立的约。虽然他们的罪使祂施行审判，然而神却不肯放弃这关系。

神的审判并不是祂对百姓的最终话语。祂应许要“对她说安慰的话”，并要使祂的子民重新归向祂，与祂建立稳固而长久的关系（2:14）。这新的婚约将不再像过去那样脆弱。神宣告说：“我必聘你永远归我为妻，以公义、公平、慈爱、怜悯聘你归我；也以诚实聘你归我，你就必认识我耶和华”（2:19–20）。有一天，神与祂百姓的关系必将被完全建立，根基在祂的公义、慈爱与信实上。

为表明这真理，神又吩咐何西阿行一件极其艰难的事：“你再去爱一个淫妇，就是她虽被人所爱，却与人行淫，好像耶和华爱以色列人，他们虽偏向别神，喜爱葡萄饼”（3:1）。何西阿就顺服，花代价将妻子从淫乱败坏的生活中赎回，使她再与自己同住。他痛苦的举动，成了神怜悯的活画。正如何西阿赎回妻子，神也必赎回祂的百姓，使他们归回祂身边。

那么，这婚约怎样能永远坚立呢？何西阿指明答案：“后来以色列人必归回，寻求他们的神耶和华，和他们的王大卫”（3:5）。神要赐下那位王——像大卫却更伟大——祂要治理祂的百姓，使他们永远与神相交。

> [!important]+ 反思与回应
因此，我们要自问：我们是否仍靠自己力量，想要维持与神的关系？还是单单安息在祂的救赎工作中？当你祷告时，求神保守你不依靠自己，并感谢祂主动将你从罪恶、悖逆与属灵的淫乱中救赎出来，使你归回祂怀中。

### <center>A Forever Marriage</center>

> [!question]+ Review
> 1.⁠ ⁠Why did God command Hosea to marry an unfaithful wife?
2.⁠ ⁠What was the significance of the names of Hosea’s children in the prophecy?
3.⁠ ⁠Why is Israel compared to an unfaithful wife?

📖 **Passage to read**: ==Hosea 02:14-03:05==

> [!info]- 🎙️Audio: [None]()  

We often see marriages break apart in this world. But here, we see a marriage that God will never allow to end—the covenant between Him and His unfaithful people. Even though He rightly judges their sin, He refuses to let go of them.

God’s judgment is never His final word. Instead, He promises to speak tenderly to His people and to bring them back to Himself in a secure and lasting way (2:14). This new marriage will not be fragile like before. God says: “And I will betroth you to me forever. I will betroth you to me in righteousness and in justice, in steadfast love and in mercy. I will betroth you to me in faithfulness. And you shall know the LORD” (2:19–20). One day, this bond between God and His people will be made permanent—built on His righteousness, love, and faithfulness.

To show this truth, God tells Hosea to take another hard step: “Go again, love a woman who is loved by another man and is an adulteress, even as the LORD loves the children of Israel, though they turn to other gods and love cakes of raisins” (3:1). Hosea obeys. He redeems his wife, buying her back from her broken life of sin, and brings her home again. His painful act becomes a living picture of God’s mercy. Just as Hosea bought his wife back, so God promises to redeem His people and restore them to Himself.

But how will this marriage last forever? Hosea gives us the answer: “Afterward the children of Israel shall return and seek the LORD their God, and David their king” (3:5). God will give them a King—one like David, but greater—who will rule them and keep them in true fellowship with Him.

> [!important]+ Reflect and Respond
So we are left with this question: are we trying to stay right with God in our own strength? Or are we resting in His redeeming work? As you pray, ask God to keep you from relying on yourself. Thank Him that He has taken the first step to bring you back—redeeming you from sin, rebellion, and spiritual unfaithfulness.
