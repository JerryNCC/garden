### <center>耶稣，完全真实的以色列</center>

> [!info]- 🎙️Audio: [None]()

在旧约中，旷野常是神子民受试炼的地方——也是他们常常失败的地方。他们发怨言，怀疑神，背离祂的话语。如今在《马太福音》第四章，我们看到耶稣“被圣灵引到旷野”（太4:1）。祂与以色列一样进入旷野，但这一次，故事的发展完全不同。

那试探人的撒但（太4:3）来到了耶稣面前。首先，他攻击耶稣肉体的软弱：饥饿。他试探耶稣将石头变成食物。但耶稣没有妥协。祂不为自己的安逸滥用能力，也不因软弱而动摇顺服。祂坚定地倚靠神的话语。接着，撒但带祂到殿顶，试探祂跳下去——这是要试探神。耶稣再次拒绝。最后，撒但拿出最大的诱惑：只要耶稣俯伏拜他，就把世上的万国与荣华都赐给祂。这是条捷径：不用走十字架的苦路，就能得着荣耀。但耶稣再一次坚决抵挡，宣告敬拜唯独属于神。

马太要我们看见一个重要的真理：耶稣在以色列失败之处完全得胜。以色列进入旷野，却失败；耶稣进入旷野，却顺服到底。以色列陷入试探；耶稣抵挡了每一次试探。祂是真正完全的以色列，是神子民忠心的代表。即使在最软弱的时候，祂仍然圣洁纯全，从未跌倒。

当然，我们不是耶稣。但我们可以学习祂抵挡试探的方式。每一次，祂都用神的话语来回应。这是祂的兵器，祂的力量，祂的盾牌。这也同样能成为我们的帮助。当试探临到时，我们是否第一时间就抓住神的话？是否让祂的话语在黑暗中发光，带来真理？这就是我们的救主耶稣站立得稳的方式。

> [!important]+ 反思与回应
所以，让我们祷告：当试探临到时，求神帮助我们第一时间想起祂的话语，并以此回应。愿祂使我们天天养成这样的习惯。

### <center>Jesus, the Perfect and True Israel</center>

> [!question]+ Review
> 1.⁠ ⁠Why was John the Baptist’s message, “Repent, for the kingdom of heaven is near”? (Matt. 3:2)
2.⁠ ⁠How did John explain the difference between himself and the Messiah? (Matt. 3:11)
3.⁠ ⁠Since Jesus had no sin, why did he still receive baptism from John?

📖 **Passage to read**: ==Matthew 04:01-11==

> [!info]- 🎙️Audio: [None]()  

In the Old Testament, the wilderness was often the place where God’s people were tested—and failed. They grumbled, doubted, and turned from God’s word. Now in Matthew 4, we find Jesus being “led up by the Spirit into the wilderness” (4:1). Just like Israel, he enters the wilderness. But this time, the story will unfold very differently.

Satan, “the tempter” (4:3), comes to Jesus. His first move is to strike at Jesus’s weakness: hunger. He tempts him to turn stones into bread. But Jesus will not give in. He will not use his power for his own comfort, nor will he let weakness turn him from obedience. He holds firm by relying on God’s word. Next, Satan takes him to the temple and tempts him to throw himself down—a test of God. Again, Jesus resists. Then comes the greatest temptation: Satan offers Jesus all the kingdoms of the world, if only Jesus will bow down and worship him. Here is a shortcut: glory without the suffering of the cross. But again, Jesus stands firm, declaring that worship belongs to God alone.

Matthew is showing us something vital: Jesus is faithful where Israel was not. Israel went into the wilderness and failed; Jesus went into the wilderness and obeyed. Israel gave in to temptation; Jesus resisted every test. Jesus is the true and perfect Israel, the faithful representative of God’s people. Even in his weakness, he stood pure and holy, never giving in.

Of course, we are not Jesus. But we can learn from how he faced temptation. Each time, he answered with the word of God. That was his weapon, his strength, his shield. And it can be ours too. When temptation comes, do we reach for God’s word? Do we let it speak light and truth into the darkness? That is how Jesus, our Savior, stood firm.

> [!important]+ Reflect and Respond
Pray that when you face temptation, your first response will be to remember and speak God’s word. Ask him to make this your habit, day by day.
