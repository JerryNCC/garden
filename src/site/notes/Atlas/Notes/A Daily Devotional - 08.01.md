### <center>第一首仆人之歌</center>

> [!info]- 🎙️Audio: [None]()

当以赛亚在本书的后半段向神的百姓宣讲这番话时，他们正被掳在外，远离故土，因长期的罪恶、拜偶像与悖逆而接受神的管教。从人的角度看，他们的光景一片混乱，自作自受。但神应许要亲自扭转这一切。问题是：祂将如何成就救恩与永远的喜乐？

不是借着军队、国家或大城，乃是借着一位人。

这是以赛亚书中第一首“仆人之歌”。这些诗歌都指向一位蒙神拣选的仆人，祂将完成神拯救百姓的计划。在历史的背景中，这些歌谣开始在神百姓的心中唤起对弥赛亚的盼望——那将要来的受膏者。这位被拣选者将是神忠心的仆人，也是神子民的领袖，祂将亲自回应他们混乱的处境。

首先，这位仆人是神所拣选，要施行公义的。他要在地上建立神的秩序，使万事归于正道。但祂并非以武力或傲慢施政，而是以温柔、怜悯与慈爱对待人。以赛亚这样描述祂的工作与领导：“压伤的芦苇他不折断，将残的灯火他不吹灭。”（42:3）这描绘了一位善待软弱者、体恤困苦人的仆人。

更重要的是，这位仆人乃是神亲自差遣与赋权的。他将成为神与百姓所立之约的彰显——活生生的记号，见证神的信实。在某种深层的意义上，祂就是那约的本体，是神应许的具象化。

读到这里，我们就会明白：这样的仆人绝非普通人。这些应许之宏大，远非一个凡人所能成就。这些话是指向那位更伟大者——那位神所差来的弥赛亚，我们相信正是主耶稣基督，神的儿子。

> [!important]+ 反思与回应
如果你的生命正处在混乱中，那么请转向这位仆人——神所拣选的救主。唯有耶稣能带来真正的公义；唯有祂温柔地医治破碎的生命；唯有祂成就神所有的救恩应许。将你的盼望安放在祂身上，感谢祂赐下拯救和那永恒不变的恩典。

### <center>First Servant Song</center>

> [!question]+ Review
> 1.⁠ ⁠Why does Isaiah emphasize “Comfort, comfort my people” in chapter 40? How does God show His mercy even in judgment?
> 2.⁠ ⁠How does Isaiah describe God’s character? How do these descriptions help you see God more clearly in your weakness?
> 3.⁠ ⁠How do you understand “those who wait for the Lord shall renew their strength”? What does this verse mean to you when you feel weary?

📖 **Passage to read**: ==Isaiah 42:01-09==

> [!info]- 🎙️Audio: [None]()  

When Isaiah speaks these words in the second part of his book, God’s people are living in exile. They are far from home, under God’s discipline for their long history of sin, idolatry, and rebellion. From a human point of view, their lives are in ruins. They brought this on themselves. But God promises to set things right. The question is: how? What is God’s plan to bring salvation and lasting joy?

He won’t do it through an army, a kingdom, or a city. He will do it through a person.

This is the first of four Servant Songs in Isaiah. Each one points to a person—God’s chosen servant—who will carry out his salvation plan. These songs begin to stir up hope among the people. They start to imagine the coming of the Messiah. He will be the one to lead them, to serve them, to save them from the mess they are in.

This servant is chosen by God to bring justice. That means he will put things right in the world, the way God wants them to be. But this servant won’t come with force or pride. He will be gentle and kind. Isaiah says, *“A bruised reed he will not break, and a faintly burning wick he will not quench”* (42:3). That’s a picture of someone who is careful with the weak and patient with the struggling. He will care for those who are hurting.

More than that, this servant is empowered and sent by God himself. He will be God’s covenant for the people—a living sign that God keeps his promises. In some deep way, he will *be* the covenant. He will represent God’s faithfulness in person.

When you read this, it becomes clear: this servant isn’t just another human leader. These promises are too big for a mere man. They point us to someone greater—someone divine. We believe these words are fully realized in Jesus Christ, the Son of God.

> [!important]+ Reflect and Respond
If your life feels like a mess, this is where you should look. Jesus is the one who brings real justice. He is the one who gently restores broken lives. He is the one who fulfills every promise of salvation. Turn to him. Put your hope in the servant God has chosen. Thank him for the rescue and the eternal promise you now have in Jesus.
