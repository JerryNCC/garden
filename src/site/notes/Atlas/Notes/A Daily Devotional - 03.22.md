### <center>以忽，拥有计划的人</center>

> [!info]- 🎙️Audio: [A Daily Devotional - 03.22 - CN]()

循环再次开始。百姓犯罪，偏离了忠诚、敬拜与顺服神的道路，结果神将他们交在摩押王以革伦手中，服事他十八年。百姓向神呼求，神回应他们，差遣了一位士师，名叫以忽。以忽是个机智、勇敢的人——他有自己的计划。他还是个左撇子，这个细节看起来似乎有点奇怪。

以忽为自己打造了一把双刃剑，意味着这把剑的两边都被磨尖，他带着这把剑去向以革伦王献上贡品。照惯例，王的卫兵会检查前来献贡之人的武器，但由于大多数人是右撇子，卫兵很可能只检查了以忽的右侧——这是一个右撇子通常会放置武器的地方。

献完贡品后，以忽告诉王，他有一则特别的信息要传达。当王站起来准备聆听以忽所说的话（这是一则来自神的信息！），以忽迅速上前，用剑刺入王的腹部，并从宫殿的阳台逃走。卫兵们没意识到发生了什么，反而以为王因为房间传出的恶臭而长时间待在厕所里。等他们终于进入房间时，发现以革伦王已经死在地上。这个刺杀事件触发了以色列人的一次大规模军事行动，他们击败了摩押军队，为以色列人争取了八十年的自由。

在这个故事中，我们看到了一幅生动且令人反感的图景，展现了罪恶的现实，尤其通过摩押王以革伦的形象。士师记的作者特别提到以革伦的体重——他是一个非常胖的人。他的死相极其可怖。当以忽刺入他的身体时，他的肠子和排泄物都流了出来。这个画面直观地表现了那些反对神和祂子民的罪与死亡。以革伦，以及整个摩押国，都是通过压迫和奴役神的百姓而“变得肥胖”。因此，神的审判对他们来说是严厉的，他们令人厌恶的罪恶最终以耻辱的方式显现出来，神的审判战胜了他们。

> [!important]+ 反思与回应
请记住，耶稣已经在十字架上战胜了你我的罪、污秽与内疚，以祂的血洁净了我们。祈求神帮助你信靠祂，作为完美且圣洁的罪审判者，同时紧紧依靠基督，祂是我们的救主。

### <center>Ehud, a Man with a Plan</center>

> [!question]+ Review
> 1. ⁠Why do the people in the book of Judges repeatedly fall into the cycle of sin? What warning does this repetitive pattern offer to us?
> 2. Why does the book of Judges emphasize the people’s departure from worshiping God after each judge’s death? What reminder does this give us for our faith today?
> 3. How does the book of Judges reflect God’s mercy and justice? How can we experience and respond to God’s mercy in our personal lives?

📖 **Passage to read**: ==Judges 03.12-30==

> [!info]- 🎙️Audio: [A Daily Devotional - 03.22 - EN]()  

The cycle begins again. The people have sinned, turning away from loyalty, worship, and obedience to God. As a result, God hands them over to King Eglon of Moab for eighteen years. The people cry out to the Lord, and He responds by sending them a judge named Ehud. Ehud is a crafty, courageous man—a man with a plan. He’s also left-handed, which might seem like an odd detail at first. 

Ehud crafts a double-edged sword for himself, which likely means the sword is sharpened on both sides of the blade, and goes to present the tribute to King Eglon. It was customary for the king’s guards to check for weapons on anyone bringing a tribute, but since most people are right-handed, they probably only checked the right side of Ehud’s body—the side where a right-handed person would usually carry a weapon.

After delivering the tribute, Ehud tells the king that he has a special message for him. When the king stands to hear what Ehud has to say (a message from God!), Ehud quickly steps forward, stabs him in the stomach with his sword, and escapes from the palace through a balcony. The guards, unaware of the situation, assume that the king is just taking a long time in the bathroom because of a bad smell coming from the room. When they finally go inside, they discover that King Eglon is dead on the floor. This sets off a major military advance for God’s people, and they defeat the Moabite army, securing freedom for the Israelites for eighty years.

In this story, we are confronted with a vivid—and even repulsive—image of the reality of sin, portrayed through King Eglon. The writer of Judges goes out of his way to tell us about Eglon’s weight—he was an extremely fat man. His death is gruesome. When Ehud stabs him, his intestines and waste pour out of him. This graphic scene illustrates the sin and death of those who oppose God and His people. Eglon, along with the entire Moabite nation, had “grown fat” by oppressing and enslaving God’s people. The punishment for this is severe, and their disgusting sin is exposed as God’s judgment triumphs over them.

> [!important]+ Reflect and Respond
Remember that Jesus has triumphed over your sin, filth, and guilt on the cross, cleansing you with His blood. Pray that God would help you trust Him as the perfect, holy judge of sin, while you cling to Christ, your Savior.
