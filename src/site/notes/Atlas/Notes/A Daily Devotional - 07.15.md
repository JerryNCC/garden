### <center>夺回各样的心意</center>

有时候，我们把《箴言》当作一句句妙语的合集——就像读温斯顿·邱吉尔或班杰明·富兰克林的格言小册子，随意翻阅几句，觉得有趣，就放下了。《箴言》第十六章初看之下也有类似的感觉。一节讲君王，一节谈言语，接着是论不义、计划、骄傲、诚实，甚至还有白发！似乎是杂乱无章的一串箴言。那么，我们该如何读这章圣经呢？

若我们细细观察，就会发现更深的主题：这章在呼召我们在上帝面前活出智慧。信息清楚不过——我们生命的每个层面，都当受上帝掌权统治的影响。我们的思想、言语、选择与行为，都该显出上帝是主宰。

看第9节：“人心筹算自己的道路；惟耶和华指引他的脚步。”这提醒我们，计划固然重要，但我们要谦卑地计划，因为真正掌权的是上帝。再看第22节：“有聪明的人，有生命的泉源；愚昧人受的教训，是愚昧。”意思是：真正的智慧来自神，而不是从世上的愚昧人那里获取。连第31节也有属灵的教导：“白发是荣耀的冠冕；在公义的道上必得着。”这里不是单单说年老，而是说：在主里敬虔地老去，是一件美善可喜的事。

整章箴言像一面镜子，反映出一个在上帝国度下生活的图像。《箴言》整卷书的重点，不只是给我们规避问题或做出更好选择的技巧，而是叫我们让上帝的主权进入生命中每一处。

因此，让我们反问自己：我的思想、言语与行动，是否都被上帝的主权塑造？我是否每日都活在“祂是王”的真实中？这，才是真正的智慧人生。

> [!important]+ 反思与回应
今天，请花一些时间向神祷告。求祂帮助你诚实守信，不是因为这样比较好，而是因为祂是真理的神。求祂帮助你在生气时能够忍耐，因为祂向你施怜悯。也求祂赐你渴慕祂话语的心，因为在其中有真正的智慧——在其中我们遇见了耶稣基督。

> 1. In Proverbs 9, what kinds of invitations do Lady Wisdom and Madame Folly offer? How are their images and words different from each other?
> 2. Why is the verse “The fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom, and knowledge of the Holy One is insight” (Prov. 9:10) considered the key message of this chapter? How does it connect to the call of wisdom?
> 3. In your daily life, how can you tell the difference between the voice of wisdom and the voice of folly? What practical steps can you take to walk on the path of wisdom and life?

📖 **Passage to read**: ==Proverbs 16==

> [!info]- 🎙️Audio: [A Daily Devotional - 07.15 - EN]()  

Sometimes we treat the book of Proverbs like a box of quotes—something like reading lines from Winston Churchill or Benjamin Franklin. We dip in here and there, enjoy a clever saying, and move on. Proverbs 16 can feel that way at first. One verse talks about kings, another about words, then injustice, plans, pride, honesty—even gray hair! It can seem random. But is that how we’re supposed to read it?

Look more closely, and you’ll see something deeper: this chapter calls us to live wisely before God. The message is clear—every part of our life should be shaped by God’s rule. What we think, how we speak, what we choose to do—everything should reflect the fact that God is in charge.

Take verse 9: “The heart of man plans his way, but the Lord establishes his steps.” That verse reminds us that planning is good, but we do it humbly. We trust that God is the one guiding our way. Or look at verse 22: “Good sense is a fountain of life to him who has it, but the instruction of fools is folly.” That tells us where true wisdom comes from—not from just anyone, but from God. And even verse 31 says something meaningful: “Gray hair is a crown of glory.” That’s not just about getting old. It’s saying that growing old with godly character is a beautiful thing.

This whole chapter gives us small pictures of what it looks like to live under God’s reign. And that’s what Proverbs is really about—wise living that comes from knowing God is King. It’s not just about avoiding trouble or making better choices. It’s about letting God shape everything.

So here are the big questions: Are your thoughts, actions, and words shaped by God’s rule? Do you live each day aware that he is King over all? That’s what it means to live wisely.

> [!important]+ Reflect and Respond
Take time today to pray. Ask God to help you be honest—not just because it’s right, but because he is true. Ask him to help you stay calm and patient—because he has shown you mercy. And ask him to make you eager to learn from his Word, because that’s where you find real wisdom—and that’s where you meet Jesus.
