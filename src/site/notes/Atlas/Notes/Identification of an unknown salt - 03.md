### Essay Question: Identification of an Unknown Salt

You are provided with an unknown salt. Your task is to identify the salt by performing a series of tests and making step-by-step deductions based on your observations.

#### Information:
- **Appearance of the Salt**: The unknown salt appears as a **white powder**.

#### Effect of heating
- **Observation**: Salt releases gas that turns the limewater milky.

#### Tests for Cation and Anion:

1. **Test for Cation (Metal Ion)**:
    - **Procedure**: Add a few drops of **dilute hydrochloric acid (HCl)** to a small amount of the salt.
    - **Observation**: A **gas** is produced, which **turns limewater milky**. 
> [!info]- Deduction
> The gas is **carbon dioxide (CO₂)**, indicating the presence of **carbonate ions (CO₃²⁻)**.

2. **Test for Anion (Non-Metal Ion)**:
    - **Procedure**: Add a few drops of **sodium hydroxide (NaOH)** solution to a small amount of the salt dissolved in water.
    - **Observation**: A **white precipitate** forms.
> [!info]- Deduction
> It forms **lead(II) hydroxide** (\( \text{Pb(OH)}_2 \)).

#### Confirmatory Tests:

1. **Confirmatory Test**:
    - **Procedure**: Add a few drops of **sodium iodide (NaI)** to the salt solution.
    - **Observation**: A **yellow precipitate** forms. 
> [!info]- Deduction
> **lead(II) iodide** (\( \text{PbI}_2 \)) forms, confirming the presence of **lead ions (Pb²⁺)**.

2. **Confirmatory Test**:
    - **Procedure**: Add a few drops of **dilute hydrochloric acid (HCl)** to a small portion of the salt.
    - **Observation**: **Effervescence** occurs.
> [!info]- Deduction
> **carbon dioxide (CO₂)** is released, which turns **limewater milky**. This confirms the presence of **carbonate ions (CO₃²⁻)**.

#### Task:
Based on the information provided and the results from the tests, identify the unknown salt. Write a detailed essay that outlines each step of the process, from observing the appearance of the salt, conducting the tests for the cation and anion, and applying the confirmatory tests. Your deductions should lead to the identification of the salt.

> [!warning]- Additional Notes:
> - **Lead Carbonate (PbCO₃)** is a **white** solid.
> - **Carbonate ions (CO₃²⁻)** react with **hydrochloric acid (HCl)** to release **carbon dioxide (CO₂)** gas, which turns limewater milky.
> - **Lead ions (Pb²⁺)** react with **sodium hydroxide (NaOH)** to form **lead(II) hydroxide (Pb(OH)₂)**, a white precipitate.
> - **Lead(II) iodide (PbI₂)** is a **yellow precipitate** that confirms the presence of **lead ions**.
