### <center>初代教会</center>

> [!info]- 🎙️Audio: [None]()


每一间教会的样貌都可能不同，有的规模宏大、制度完善；有的简朴温馨、人数不多。  
但最重要的是——你的教会是否忠于福音，是否持守上帝话语的教导？

《使徒行传》2章42至47节向我们描绘了初代信徒群体的生活景象——那是被圣灵大能塑造的群体。  
这几节经文并非要求每一间教会都要照样仿行，而是向我们显明：当上帝的灵在祂子民中工作时，会带出怎样的生命与群体特质。

那时的教会热爱敬拜。信徒们“恒心遵守使徒的教训”（2:42），渴慕更深地认识耶稣——祂是谁，祂所成就的救赎，以及如何在生活中跟随祂。  
他们常常聚集，有时在家中，一同祷告、学习、赞美神。  
没有人强迫他们这样做，是重生的生命在他们心中生出对神话语的渴慕、对群体敬拜的喜乐。  
这样的热诚，是否也在你的心中？

这群信徒之间也充满了爱与慷慨。  
经文说他们“凡物公用”，并不是说他们在实行某种“共有制度”，而是他们因彼此相爱，乐意分享所拥有的一切。  
他们的慷慨正是神恩典的流露——以时间、金钱、物质彼此扶持，实际地表达基督的爱。

更重要的是，这教会的成长来自神自己。  
最后一节清楚指出：“主将得救的人天天加给他们。”  
教会的兴旺，并非靠人的策略或领袖的能力，而是主亲自的作为。  
是上帝藉着圣灵在建造祂的教会，召聚一群敬拜并爱慕耶稣的百姓。

> [!important]+ 反思与回应
亲爱的弟兄姐妹，这就是我们的属灵传承。  
虽然今日的教会外貌与当年大不相同，但根基却相同——使徒关于基督的教导、群体的团契、敬拜的喜乐与慷慨的爱心。  
感谢上帝，让你我成为祂教会的一部分，这教会从复活之主的日子起，就在圣灵的能力中不断成长。  
求主也赐你同样的热心，喜爱敬拜、乐于相交、甘心服事，使荣耀都归于基督。

Churches can look very different from one another. Some are large and structured; others are small and simple. But what matters most is this: is your church faithful to the gospel and committed to teaching God’s Word? Acts 2:42–47 gives us a picture of the first generation of believers—a community shaped by the work of the Holy Spirit. These verses don’t set a fixed pattern for every church in every age, but they do show us what it looks like when God’s Spirit is truly at work among his people.

The early church loved to worship. The believers “devoted themselves to the apostles’ teaching” (2:42). They wanted to know more about Jesus—who he was, what he had done, and what it meant to follow him. They gathered often, sometimes in homes, to pray, to learn, and to praise God together. No one was forcing them to do this. Their new life in Christ created a genuine hunger for God’s Word and a deep joy in being with his people. Does that kind of devotion describe your own heart?

This was also a community marked by love and generosity. When Acts says they “had all things in common,” it doesn’t mean they practiced some sort of communal living. It means that they cared so deeply for each other that they gladly shared what they had. Their generosity was a reflection of God’s grace. They used their time, resources, and possessions to meet needs and to show love in practical ways.

And notice this: the growth of the church came from God himself. The last verse makes this clear—“the Lord added to their number day by day.” The church’s life and increase were not the result of clever planning or impressive leadership. It was the Lord’s work. God was building his church by the power of his Spirit, gathering together people who loved and worshiped Jesus as their risen Savior and Lord.

> [!important]+ Reflect and Respond
This is the heritage we share. Our churches today may look very different, but they rest on the same foundation—the apostles’ teaching about Jesus Christ, the fellowship of believers, the joy of worship, and generous love. Thank God that you belong to his growing church, which began on those Spirit-filled days in Jerusalem. Ask him to renew in you that same joy in worship, fellowship, and service, all for the glory of Christ.
