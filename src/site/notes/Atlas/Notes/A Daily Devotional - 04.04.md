### <center>说话吧，仆人在听</center>

> [!info]- 🎙️Audio: [A Daily Devotional - 04.04 - CN]()

撒母耳记上第3章是一个让人印象深刻的章节。它开头告诉我们“那时耶和华的话语稀少”（撒母耳记上3:1），因此接下来发生的事让人感到意外！神确实说话了，但他并没有对祭司以利说话，而是对年轻的撒母耳说话。尽管神呼唤撒母耳三次，撒母耳直到意识到这是神在呼唤他时，才知道该如何回应。

撒母耳对神呼召的反应至关重要——这实际上塑造了他一生的事奉与使命。当撒母耳终于意识到是神的声音时，他回到了床上。再次听见神的声音时，他回应道：“说话吧，仆人在听”（撒母耳记上3:10）。这句话简洁地总结了撒母耳一生的事奉！他是神话语的仆人，生活在神的话语之下，并忠实地将其传达给神的百姓。

神给撒母耳的信息并不轻松。这是一个审判的信息，特别是针对以利腐败的两个儿子。这是神第一次让撒母耳将信息传达给他的百姓，撒母耳忠实地将这个信息传递给了以利，而以利也接受了这是神的旨意。

这是神对撒母耳的呼召——一个将通过传讲神的话语来忠实带领神百姓的人。随着章节的结束，我们看到撒母耳的影响力开始增长：“耶和华与他同在，使他所说的每一句话都没有落空”（撒母耳记上3:19）。撒母耳被所有神的百姓认定为真正的先知——不是因为他有伟大的个性、军事力量或领袖魅力，而是因为人们知道他传讲的是神的话语。这个话语将成为撒母耳事奉和领导的基础和力量。

> [!important]+ 反思与回应
当你反思自己对神话语——圣经——的态度时，不妨问问自己：当我阅读圣经或听到讲道时，我是怎样的心态？我会感到厌倦、批评或漠视吗？还是像撒母耳一样，每次来到神的话语前，我都愿意说：“说话吧，仆人在听”？神使用那些愿意倾听和顺服他话语的人。今天，祈求神帮助你准备好听祂的话语，并愿意顺服。

### <center>Speak, for Your Servant Hears</center>

> [!question]+ Review
> 1. ⁠Why were the actions of Eli's sons, Hophni and Phinehas, considered corrupt in God's eyes? How did their behavior affect the faith life of the Israelites?
> 2. The article mentions that Samuel grew up and found favor with both God and man. How does this contrast with the corrupt priests? What is the significance of Samuel's faithful service to God's people?
> 3. If you are in a position of spiritual leadership, how can you ensure that you are faithful to God's word and serve God's people with the right attitude? How does this affect your personal faith life?

📖 **Passage to read**: ==1 Samuel 03==

> [!info]- 🎙️Audio: [A Daily Devotional - 04.04 - EN]()  

1 Samuel 3 is one of those chapters that sticks with you. It begins by telling us that “the word of the LORD was rare in those days” (1 Sam. 3:1), so what happens next is unexpected! God does speak, but he doesn’t speak to the priest, Eli. Instead, God speaks to the young boy, Samuel. And even though God calls Samuel three times, it isn’t until Samuel realizes that it’s God speaking that he can respond.

Samuel’s reaction to God’s call is significant—it really shapes the entire life and ministry he will have. After finally realizing that it’s God’s voice calling him, Samuel goes back to bed. When he hears the voice again, he responds, “Speak, for your servant hears” (3:10). That’s a perfect way to sum up Samuel’s entire ministry! He is a man of God’s word, living under it and faithfully speaking it to God’s people.

The message God gives to Samuel is not an easy one. It’s a message of judgment, especially against Eli’s corrupt sons. This is the first message God asks Samuel to deliver to His people, and Samuel faithfully shares it with Eli, who accepts it as God’s will.

This is God’s call of Samuel as a prophet—a man who will faithfully lead God’s people by speaking His word to them. As the chapter wraps up, we see Samuel’s influence begin to grow: “The LORD was with him, and let none of his words fall to the ground” (3:19). Samuel is recognized by all of God’s people as a true prophet—not because of his personality, strength, or charisma, but because they knew he spoke the word of God. That word would be the foundation and strength of Samuel’s ministry and leadership.

> [!important]+ Reflect and Respond
As you reflect on your own attitude toward God’s word—the Bible—ask yourself: How do I approach the Bible when I read it or hear it preached? Do I feel bored, critical, or dismissive? Or do I, like Samuel, come to God’s word, ready to listen and obey, saying, “Speak, for your servant hears”? God uses people with that kind of heart. Pray today, asking God to make you ready to listen to His word and willing to obey it.
