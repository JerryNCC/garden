### <center>这是结局吗？</center>

> [!info]- 🎙️Audio: [None]()

《耶利米哀歌》的作者站在耶路撒冷的废墟中，亲眼看见城池被毁，百姓被掳。他明白，这是长期无视罪恶所带来的代价。他爱上帝的子民，也爱那上帝曾立名的城，如今却只能深切哀哭。

《耶利米哀歌》读起来并不容易，因为叙述的声音不断转换。在第一章中，有时是作者在述说耶路撒冷的遭遇，有时又仿佛耶路撒冷自己在倾诉悲痛。然而，信息却清晰无误：上帝子民的京城已经被压垮。这本身就足以令我们与上帝的百姓一同哭泣，甚至与这座城一同流泪。

罪的结果正是如此——败坏与毁灭。曾经荣耀的耶路撒冷，如今污秽凄凉。对以色列人来说，耶路撒冷会陷落几乎不可想象；他们以为上帝绝不会让祂的圣城被攻取。但这一切真的发生了：城被焚烧，百姓被掳。此书提醒我们，罪与刚硬的心必带来灭亡。

然而，即便在这里，盼望的微光仍在闪现。流亡原本可能是上帝与祂百姓故事的终点，但事实并非如此。在本章后半段，耶路撒冷的“声音”承认：“耶和华是公义的，我是违背他命令的。”（哀一18）这正是上帝一直所要的——真实的悔改。对于那些回转归向祂的人，祂必施怜悯。正如《耶利米哀歌》第三章所说，祂的慈爱永不止息。圣经并未以这哀歌作结，而是继续讲述救赎的故事。

> [!important]+ 反思与回应
巴比伦并不是上帝子民的结局，罪也不是我们的结局。上帝本可以公义地将我们从历史中除灭，但祂在耶稣基督里赐下恩典。要为此向祂献上感谢——因为祂回应了罪与审判的深切哀号。并求祂使你在这堕落的世界中成为盼望的声音，引人归向祂的儿子——救主。

### <center>Is This the End?</center>

> [!question]+ Review
> 1.⁠ ⁠In Jeremiah 52, how did the king of Babylon capture Jerusalem, and what was the fate of King Zedekiah?
2.⁠ ⁠What did the destruction of the temple and the plundering of the sacred objects mean for the people of Israel? How did this affect their relationship with God?
3.⁠ ⁠How does the Babylonian king’s kindness to Jehoiachin show that God was still keeping His promise to David? What hope does this bring?

📖 **Passage to read**: ==Lamentation 01==

> [!info]- 🎙️Audio: [None]()  

The writer of Lamentations stood in the middle of Jerusalem’s ruins. He saw the city broken, the people taken away, and he knew this was the cost of long–ignored sin. He loved God’s people. He loved the city where God had placed his name. And now he mourned—deeply.

Lamentations can be hard to follow because the voice shifts. In chapter 1, sometimes the author speaks about Jerusalem. Other times, it’s as though Jerusalem itself speaks, with its own grief and pain. But the message is clear: the city of God’s people has been crushed. That alone should make us weep—with God’s people, and even with the city itself.

This is what sin does. It ruins. It destroys. Jerusalem, once honored, is now filthy and empty. For Israel, the thought that Jerusalem could fall seemed impossible. Surely God would not allow his special place to be taken. But it happened. The city burned. The people went into exile. The book reminds us: sin and stubborn hearts bring disaster.

Yet, even here, hope flickers. The exile could have been the end of God’s story with his people—but it wasn’t. In the second half of the chapter, the “voice” of Jerusalem admits: “The LORD is in the right, for I have rebelled against his word” (1:18). That’s the beginning of what God has always wanted—true repentance. And for those who return to him, there is mercy. His mercies, Lamentations 3 tells us, never end. The Bible doesn’t finish with this lament—it moves on to redemption.

> [!important]+ Reflect and Respond
Babylon wasn’t the last word for God’s people. And sin isn’t the last word for us. God would be right to erase us from history. But he has given us grace in Jesus. Thank him for answering the deep cry of sin and judgment. Ask him to make you a voice of hope in this broken world—pointing people to his Son, the Savior.
