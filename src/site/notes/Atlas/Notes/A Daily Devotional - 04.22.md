圣经中的某些段落充当着重要的标记，指引我们认识神计划中的关键时刻。这些时刻有时以圣约的形式出现，神与祂的百姓立下约定。其中之一便出现在《撒母耳记下》第七章，神在以色列国度兴起的过程中，向大卫王显现，赐下一个伟大的约。

大卫在经历了和平的国度后，心中渴望为神建造一座殿。可是，神告诉他，他并不是要为神建造这座殿；他的儿子将会完成这个使命。先知拿单将神的旨意传达给大卫：“你寿数满足，与你列祖同睡的时候，我必使你的后裔接续你，出自你身体的，他必建造我的名的殿”（7:12–13）。

然而，随着经文的展开，神通过拿单对大卫的言语似乎超越了大卫亲生儿子所建的殿的范围：“我必坚立他国度的宝座，直到永远……你的宝座必坚立直到永远”（7:13–16）。这里提到的“永远”二字应当让我们深思。大卫和所罗门的国度的确辉煌，但它们并没有持续永远。事实上，在大卫的后代仅仅两代后，以色列的国度就开始出现严重的危机。

既然没有任何人类的王能够建立一个永恒的国度，那这个王必定不仅仅是人类的王！神对大卫的应许最终在神的儿子耶稣身上得以应验，耶稣是大卫的后裔。当神差遣天使加百列向玛利亚显现时，他用类似于大卫王朝的语言告诉她：“看哪，你将怀孕生子，给他起名叫耶稣。他将为大，称为至高者的儿子。主神必把他祖大卫的王位给他，他要作雅各家永远的王，他的国度没有穷尽”（路加福音1:31–33）。

> [!important]+ 反思与回应
耶稣是神百姓永恒的王！祂的国度“不是属乎这世界的”（约翰福音18:36），进入这个国度的道路，是通过永恒之王为祂百姓的罪死在十字架上。你是否通过这位永恒之王的舍命进入了神的国度？今天，求神帮助你在祷告中思考这个问题。

### <center>A Forever Kingdom</center>

> [!question]+ Review
> 1. ⁠Why was Uzzah punished for touching the Ark in 2 Samuel 6? What does this incident teach us about God’s holiness and justice?
> 2. ⁠What did David’s dancing and leaping in front of the Ark reveal about his attitude? How did Michal’s reaction differ from David’s, and what lesson about worship can we learn from this contrast?
> 3. The article mentions that God has shown us great mercy, even though He could have punished us as He did Uzzah. How do you understand the balance between God’s mercy and justice? How does this affect our faith and actions in daily life?

📖 **Passage to read**: ==2 Samuel 07==

> [!info]- 🎙️Audio: [A Daily Devotional - 04.22 - EN]()  

Certain passages in the Bible act as important markers, showing us key moments in God’s plan. Some of these moments come in the form of covenants, where God makes promises to His people. One of these covenants is found in 2 Samuel 7, where God speaks to King David in the midst of Israel’s rise as a nation.

David has just experienced peace in his kingdom, and he desires to build a house—a temple—for God. But God tells him that he will not be the one to build it; his son will do it. Nathan, the prophet, relays God’s message to David: "When your days are fulfilled and you lie down with your fathers, I will raise up your offspring after you, who shall come from your body, and I will establish his kingdom. He shall build a house for my name" (7:12–13).

As the passage continues, however, God’s words to David through Nathan seem to reach beyond the reign of David’s literal son Solomon: "I will establish the throne of his kingdom forever... Your throne shall be established forever" (7:13–16). The mention of forever should make us pause. The reign of David and Solomon was indeed great, but it didn’t last forever. In fact, just two generations after David, things began to go badly for the kingdom of Israel.Since no human king could establish a kingdom that would last forever, it’s clear that this king must be more than just a human king! This promise to David is ultimately fulfilled in God’s Son, Jesus, who would be a human descendant of David. When God sends the angel Gabriel to Mary, he uses language that echoes David’s line: "And behold, you will conceive in your womb and bear a son, and you shall call his name Jesus. He will be great and will be called the Son of the Most High. And the Lord God will give to him the throne of his father David, and he will reign over the house of Jacob forever, and of his kingdom there will be no end" (Luke 1:31–33).

> [!important]+ Reflect and Respond
Jesus is the forever King of God’s people! His kingdom is "not of this world" (John 18:36), and the way into it is through the King’s death on the cross for the sins of His people. Have you entered God’s kingdom through the sacrificial death of the forever King? Pray about this today.
