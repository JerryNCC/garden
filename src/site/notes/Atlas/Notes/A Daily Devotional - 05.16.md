### <center>逃亡中的先知</center>

> [!info]- 🎙️Audio: [A Daily Devotional - 05.16 - CN]()

有些人认为，如果你跟随神，你的生活会变得更轻松、更安全、更舒适。这就是所谓的“健康与财富福音”。但圣经并没有这样教导。事实上，圣经告诉我们，生活即使对于最忠心的人来说，也依然会充满艰难。以利亚就是一个很好的例子。他是在邪恶的亚哈王和耶洗别王后的日子里，神的忠实先知。你可能会认为，既然他如此忠心，事情应该会对他有利。但事实并非如此。

首先，情况可能会变得更糟，才会好转。在以利亚战胜巴力的先知之后，我们本应期待他会获得一些安慰。然而，耶洗别，亚哈的妻子，成为了他最大的威胁。以利亚不得不逃入旷野，保命。面对的挑战并未结束，它们才刚刚开始。

其次，我们并不总是理解神在我们生活中的每一件事。在这段经文中，我们看到一个非常人性的以利亚。听听他对神的呼求：“够了，主啊，求你取我的命，因为我不比我的祖宗好”（19:4）。他向神抱怨，提醒神自己是如此忠心，结果却落得如此下场！这位伟大的神的先知，现在正陷入困境，他对神的计划感到困惑。

第三，神始终对服侍祂的人保持忠信。神派遣天使来加添力量，给以利亚食物和水。但更重要的是，神亲自降临以利亚。在这场伟大的场景中，神先是让一阵强风、地震、火焰来临——这些都是神能力的象征，曾在迦密山与巴力的先知们较量时显现过。然而，神选择在微小的声音中与以利亚相遇（19:12）。神提醒他自己的计划，并命令他膏立以利沙接替他，继续神的工作。神没有抛弃祂的仆人。

> [!important]+ 反思与回应
虽然我们可能无法理解生活中的每一件困苦，但我们可以确信，神对祂的百姓是忠诚的。祂不会抛弃我们，而是始终以祂的同在和话语临近我们。求神帮助我们记住这一点，求祂赐给我们力量和希望——不是依赖舒适或成功，而是依靠祂自己。

> 1. What challenge did Elijah present at the showdown on Mount Carmel? What was the purpose of this challenge?
> 2. ⁠How did Elijah use water on the altar to demonstrate God's power? How does this help us understand God's abilities and plans?
> 3. After God showed His presence through fire, why did the people recognize that Yahweh was the true God? How can we avoid forgetting God's works and grace in our daily lives?

📖 **Passage to read**: ==1 Kings 19==

> [!info]- 🎙️Audio: [A Daily Devotional - 05.16 - EN]()  

Some people believe that if you follow God, your life will become easier, safer, and more comfortable. That’s the message of the “health and wealth gospel.” But Scripture doesn’t teach this. In fact, the Bible shows us that life can still be hard—even for the most faithful. Elijah is a great example. He was God’s prophet during the dark days of King Ahab and Queen Jezebel. You might think that because he was so faithful, things would go well for him. But that’s not how the story goes.

First, things may get harder before they get better. After Elijah’s victory over the prophets of Baal, we’d expect some relief. But Jezebel, Ahab’s wife, now becomes his greatest threat. Elijah has to flee to the wilderness to save his life. His challenges aren’t over—they’ve just begun.

Second, we don’t always understand what God is doing. Elijah was tired, afraid, and discouraged. He prayed for God to take his life, saying, “I’m no better than my ancestors.” He told God how faithful he had been—and yet look where it got him. Elijah, this mighty prophet, was now deeply struggling. He was confused about what God was doing.

Third, God is always faithful to those who serve Him. God sends an angel to care for Elijah, giving him food and water. But even more important than that, God comes to Elijah Himself. On Mount Horeb, God sends a strong wind, then an earthquake, and then a fire—big, dramatic signs of His power. But God speaks to Elijah in a soft whisper. That’s where Elijah finds God—not in the loudness, but in the quiet. Then God gives Elijah a new mission. He tells him to anoint Elisha as the next prophet. Elijah is not alone. God still has a plan.

> [!important]+ Reflect and Respond
We may go through things we don’t understand. But we can know this for sure—God is faithful. He draws near to us with His presence and His word. Ask God to help you remember this. Ask Him for strength and for hope—not in comfort or success, but in Him alone.
