### <center>参孙</center>

> [!info]- 🎙️Audio: [A Daily Devotional - 03.27 - CN]()

参孙虽然不是上帝子民的最终审判者，但他的故事在许多方面预示着将来伟大领袖的到来——撒母耳、施洗约翰和耶稣基督。为什么会这样呢？

首先，参孙的诞生源自他母亲的不孕，神通过神迹使她怀孕。参孙的母亲是摩挪亚的妻子，她曾无法生育。这让我们想起了亚伯拉罕和撒拉的故事，他们直到神奇迹般地赐给他们以撒，才有了孩子。以色列历史上最伟大的士师撒母耳，也是由一位以为自己不能生育的母亲所生。施洗约翰的母亲伊丽莎白也曾因年老而不育，直到神在她的暮年赐给她一子。这个主题——神使不孕变为多产，目的在于为祂的工作成就而成就祂的百姓——在圣经中反复出现。

第二，参孙的诞生由神的使者宣布。这一点应该立刻让我们意识到，这个婴儿的生命中将有大事发生。当神为祂的百姓兴起伟大领袖时，他们的诞生常常是由天使来宣告的。

第三，参孙的出现与一个拯救神百姓脱离敌人的应许紧密相连。天使对参孙的父母说：“孩子要从母腹里归神做拿细耳人，他要开始拯救以色列人脱离非利士人的手”（士13:5）。参孙为以色列带来了许多胜利，暂时成为他们的“救主”。

然而，即便有这些胜利，参孙还是像其他士师一样——深受罪恶的腐蚀，充满了致命的缺陷。他不是那个能够永远、公正地统治上帝子民的王。他们依然期待一个更伟大的审判者，一个会降生在罪恶的世界中并由天使宣告的救主。这个救主将不仅仅是拯救他们脱离敌军，更是拯救他们脱离罪恶。

> [!important]+ 反思与回应
神不会放弃祂的百姓，我们今天应该为此感恩。虽然我们理应被神抛弃，但祂没有。祂的追求没有停止，直到祂的儿子在十字架上为我们提供了最终、永恒的拯救之道，拯救祂所爱的人。感谢神对我们不离不弃的承诺，尽管我们不配。

### <center>Samson</center>

> [!question]+ Review
> 1. ⁠How did Jephthah go from being an outcast to a leader of Israel? Does this provide insight into how God uses imperfect people to fulfill His plans?
> 2. ⁠What mistake did Jephthah make in his vow? How does his actions reflect a lack of understanding and trust in God?
> 3. How did Jephthah’s tragic end, caused by his foolish vow and lack of true knowledge of God, serve as a warning? What lessons can we learn from this to avoid repeating the same mistakes?

📖 **Passage to read**: ==Judges 13==

> [!info]- 🎙️Audio: [A Daily Devotional - 03.27 - EN]()  

Samson will not be the final, ultimate judge for God’s people, but his story points us forward in significant ways to the great leaders who will come—Samuel, John the Baptist, and Jesus Christ. Why is that?

First, Samson’s birth comes from the barrenness of his mother, who miraculously becomes pregnant through God’s intervention. Samson’s mother, the wife of a man named Manoah, was unable to have children. This should remind us of the story of Abraham and Sarah, who couldn’t have children until God miraculously gave them Isaac. The greatest judge in Israel’s history, Samuel, was also born to a mother who thought she couldn’t have children. Elizabeth, the mother of John the Baptist, was barren until God gave her a son in her old age. This theme—God turning barrenness into fruitfulness for the sake of His work in and through His people—appears repeatedly in Scripture.

Second, Samson’s birth is announced by an angel of the Lord. This should immediately signal to us that something significant is about to unfold through the life of this child. When God raises up great leaders for His people, their births are often announced by angels.
Third, Samson’s arrival is linked to a promise of salvation for God’s people from their enemies. The angel speaks to Samson’s parents, saying, “The child shall be a Nazirite to God from the womb, and he shall begin to save Israel from the hand of the Philistines” (13:5). Samson brings Israel many victories over the Philistines, acting as a temporary savior in this way. 

But even with these victories, Samson proves to be like all the other judges we’ve seen—deeply flawed and corrupted by sin. He is not the one who can rule God’s people in the final, eternal way they need. They still long for a greater judge, someone who will be born into a sinful world and announced by angels. This Savior will not rescue them from an enemy army, but from their sins.

> [!important]+ Reflect and Respond
God will not give up on His people, and we should thank Him for that today. Though we deserve for Him to abandon us, He doesn’t. He didn’t stop His pursuit of us until His own Son hung on a cross, providing the final, ultimate way of salvation for those He loves. Thank God for His unwavering commitment to us, even though we don’t deserve it.
