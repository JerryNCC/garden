### <center>要预备！</center>

> [!info]- 🎙️Audio: [None]()


我们常常觉得，这个世界会一天天照着现在的样子继续下去，似乎永远不会改变。但耶稣告诉我们不是这样。祂说：“天地要废去”（马可福音13:31）。我们眼前的一切，正奔向那最终的日子。

这段教导开始于门徒对圣殿的赞叹。他们看着那宏伟的石头和壮丽的建筑，说：“夫子，请看，这是何等的石头，何等的殿宇！”（13:1）但耶稣却出人意料地回答他们，说这些石头将来没有一块会留在另一块上，总要被拆毁。后来，四个门徒私下问祂：“请告诉我们，这些事什么时候要成就？这一切将要成就的时候，有什么预兆呢？”（13:4）接下来的整章，都是耶稣对这个问题的回答。

这段经文有许多细节，不同的人对事情如何发生也有不同的解释。但有几件事是清楚的。第一，世界的末了不会毫无预兆。战争、地震、灾难，都在提醒我们，这世界不是永存的。第二，耶稣告诉祂的门徒，他们将面对艰难。神应许救恩，但跟随祂的人可能会遭遇逼迫、患难，甚至殉道。第三，在耶稣再来之前，将会有假基督、假教师出现，他们要迷惑人，使人转离对基督的信靠。

那么，我们该如何回应呢？耶稣给出简单而重要的命令：“你们要谨慎，要儆醒”（13:33）。没有人知道那日子、那时辰，就连耶稣在世上的时候，也说只有父知道确切的时间。我们的任务不是去猜测日期，而是要忠心、警醒，随时预备迎接祂的再来。

> [!important]+ 反思与回应
求神帮助我们在信心中儆醒不倦。求圣灵赐下更深的爱，使我们更爱救主耶稣，并坚固我们对祂话语的信靠——那永不废去的话语。

📖 **Passage to read**: ==Mark 13==

> [!info]- 🎙️Audio: [None]()  

It often feels like the world around us will just keep going, day after day, without end. But Jesus tells us something different. “Heaven and earth will pass away” (13:31). Everything we see is moving toward a final day.

This teaching begins when the disciples admire the temple. They look at its great stones and beautiful buildings and say, “Look, Teacher, what wonderful stones and what wonderful buildings!” (13:1). But Jesus surprises them. He says that every one of those stones will one day be torn down. Later, four of the disciples ask him privately, “When will these things be, and what will be the sign when all these things are about to be accomplished?” (13:4). The rest of the chapter is Jesus’ answer.

There are many details in this passage, and people have different ideas about exactly how everything will happen. But some things are clear. First, the end of the world will not come without warning. Wars, earthquakes, and disasters will remind us that this world is temporary. Second, Jesus tells his followers to expect trouble. God promises salvation, but his people may face persecution, suffering, and even death along the way. Third, before Jesus returns, false teachers and deceivers will appear. They will try to turn people away from trusting in Christ.

So how should we respond? Jesus gives a simple command: “Be on guard, keep awake” (13:33). No one knows the day or the hour. During his time on earth, even Jesus said that only the Father knows the exact timing. Our task is not to guess the date. Our task is to stay faithful, alert, and ready for his return.

> [!important]+ Reflect and Respond
Pray that God will help you stay awake in your faith. Ask the Holy Spirit to give you a deeper love for Jesus and a stronger trust in his word, the word that will never pass away.
