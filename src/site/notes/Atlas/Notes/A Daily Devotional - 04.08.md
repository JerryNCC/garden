在《撒母耳记上》10章中，我们看到神应允了百姓的要求——给他们一个他们所想要的王。他们请求拥有一个王，以便像周围其他国家一样，拥有一个代表他们的领导者。因此，神赐给了他们扫罗。

扫罗是百姓认为他们需要的王。扫罗看起来就像个王。他身材高大，足足比以色列其他人高出一头一肩。从人的角度看，扫罗无疑是完美的选择。他是百姓心中那位能够轻松带领他们的国王。在《撒母耳记上》10:24中，撒母耳在百姓面前宣布扫罗时说道：“你们看见耶和华所拣选的人没有？在众百姓中没有一个像他的。”百姓大声回应：“愿王万岁！”他们终于拥有了他们所渴望的人类国王，像其他民族一样。

一开始，扫罗的登基似乎充满希望。他与神有了真切的相遇，心也发生了改变。在《撒母耳记上》11章中，他带领以色列赢得了一场重要的军事胜利。在10章的结尾，扫罗甚至表现出了克制，没有报复那些质疑他做王的人。然而，当扫罗真正坐上王位时，我们依然感到一丝不安。撒母耳说“在众百姓中没有一个像他的”，这让我们想起，以色列原本就有一位国王——神，祂一直在领导以色列，且使他们与其他民族区别开来。

扫罗加冕的过程引发了许多疑问。他被发现藏在行李堆中，这暗示了他的勇气和品格。而且，叙事者特别强调了扫罗的外貌，我们得知他因身高而在人群中非常显眼，仿佛作者在强调：“这个人看起来像个王。”但这一切也让我们不禁思考：他是否拥有做王的心？

> [!important]+ 反思与回应
我们常常过于注重外貌、名气和受欢迎程度，甚至根据这些因素做决定。今天，祈求神帮助你看透人的外表，无论你是否觉得他们吸引人。求神帮助你像祂一样看待他人：珍贵的，按祂的形象所造的，需要祂的拯救之恩，才能追随并爱祂。

> [!question]+ Review
> 1. Why did God allow the Philistines to discover Dagon fallen and broken, and why did the Philistines keep suffering disasters? What spiritual lessons are being taught through these events?
> 2. Why did God not allow Israel to request a human king to follow the ways of the surrounding nations? What attitudes of the people are revealed in this request before God?
> 3. As God demonstrates His sovereignty and power, how can the people avoid forgetting Him in the successes and blessings of life? How can we maintain our focus on our relationship with God?

📖 **Passage to read**: ==1 Samuel 10==

> [!info]- 🎙️Audio: [A Daily Devotional - 04.8 - EN]()  

In 1 Samuel 10, we see God giving the people exactly what they wanted. They had asked for a king, wanting to be like all the other nations around them. They wanted a king to lead them, to represent them to the other people. So, God gave them Saul.

Saul was the king the people thought they wanted. He looked the part. He was tall—head and shoulders above everyone else in Israel. From a human perspective, Saul seemed like the perfect choice. He was the king they could easily imagine leading them. In 1 Samuel 10:24, Samuel announces Saul before the people, saying, "Do you see him whom the LORD has chosen? There is none like him among all the people." The people respond with shouts of approval: “Long live the king!” Finally, they have the human king they were longing for, just like all the other nations.

At first, things seem promising. Saul has a genuine encounter with God, and his heart is changed. In 1 Samuel 11, he leads Israel to a great military victory. In the final moments of 1 Samuel 10, Saul even shows restraint by not taking revenge on those who questioned his kingship. Still, as Saul takes the throne, we sense a certain unease. Samuel’s words, "There is none like him," remind us that Israel already had a King—God, the one who had ruled over them and set them apart from all the other nations. 

The way Saul’s coronation unfolds raises questions. He’s found hiding among the baggage, which suggests something about his courage and character. And then, the narrator makes sure we know exactly what Saul looks like. We’re told he stands out because of his height, as if the writer is emphasizing, "This guy looks like a king." But this leaves us wondering: Does he have the heart of a king?

> [!important]+ Reflect and Respond
We often focus on appearances, popularity, and fame, and we make decisions based on those things. Today, pray that God would help you look beyond how people appear—whether you find them attractive or not. Ask Him to help you see others as He sees them: precious, created in His image, and in need of His saving grace to follow and love Him.
