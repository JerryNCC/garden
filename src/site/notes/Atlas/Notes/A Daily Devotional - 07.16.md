### <center>真正的美</center>

> [!info]- 🎙️Audio: [A Daily Devotional - 07.16 - CN]()

《箴言》第三十一章曾是许多讲道的主题，通常是讲给女性听的。诚然，这段经文确实为姊妹们提供了许多宝贵的教导。然而，有件事值得我们深思：这一章原本并不是对女人说的，而是一位母亲对她儿子的劝勉。

这章圣经从一位母亲的声音开始，她郑重其事地劝戒她的儿子——利慕伊勒王。她看清了儿子的倾向，心中充满担忧。利慕伊勒似乎总是追逐那些不合宜的女子——那些不是建立王的生命，反而会毁坏他的女子。于是她劝他说：“不要将你的精力给妇女，也不要有败坏君王的行为”（箴31:3）。

她不只发出警告，还为儿子描绘出更美的异象——那就是他应当寻求怎样的女子。这正是31章10至31节的核心：一位“才德的妇人”的肖像。这种女子才是利慕伊勒当追求的人。

那这位妇人为何如此独特？她值得信赖，只为丈夫行善。她勤劳、有目标。她使丈夫得尊荣、得建立，也以智慧和温柔细心照顾家人和儿女。但她真正的美丽之处，是因为她“敬畏耶和华”。

年轻的弟兄们，不妨自问：你所吸引的是哪一类女子？是那些轻浮、嬉笑、讨人喜欢的“世俗美女”？还是你已经预备好自己的心，去欣赏一位真正敬虔的女子？只有当你自己真心地跟随主耶稣时，你的心才会被这样敬虔的女子所吸引。

而年轻的姊妹们，这段经文的目的，并不是要给你们加上沉重的负担。虽然它描绘的是一幅理想化的图画，但它确实指出了真正属灵美丽的源头——就是“敬畏耶和华”。唯有当你以上帝为你心中至宝，你才会散发出那真正动人的光辉，吸引那位也敬畏神的男人。

> [!important]+ 反思与回应
为这些事向神祷告吧！求祂使你一生寻求祂，将祂放在首位。也求祂，若祂有旨意赐你婚姻，便从今日起就开始塑造你的心，使你成为一位敬虔的丈夫或妻子，在神面前智慧而圣洁地行走。

### <center>True Beauty</center>

> [!question]+ Review
> 1. How does Proverbs 16 highlight God’s control over our lives and decisions? What does this teach us about planning and trust?
> 2. What contrast does this chapter make between wisdom and foolishness? How can we learn to recognize true wisdom that comes from God?

📖 **Passage to read**: ==Proverbs 31==

> [!info]- 🎙️Audio: [A Daily Devotional - 07.16 - EN]()  

Proverbs 31 has been the subject of many sermons, especially aimed at women. And there’s certainly a lot for women to learn from this passage. But here’s something to think about: these words weren’t originally spoken *to* women. They were spoken *by* a woman—to a man.

This chapter begins with the voice of a mother, giving serious advice to her son, King Lemuel. She sees his habits, and she’s concerned. It sounds like Lemuel had a weakness for the wrong kind of women—women who tear men down instead of building them up. So his mother warns him, “Do not give your strength to women, your ways to those who destroy kings” (31:3).

She doesn’t stop at warning. She gives him something better—a vision of the kind of woman he *should* seek. And that’s where verses 10–31 come in: the picture of a wise and excellent wife. This is the kind of woman Lemuel should desire.

What makes this woman so special? She is trustworthy. She works with energy and purpose. She helps her husband flourish. She loves her family and cares for them with strength and grace. But most of all—she fears the Lord. That’s what makes her beautiful.

Young men, think about this: What kind of woman are you drawn to? The world praises charm, looks, and fun personalities. But is your heart ready to value what God values? The best way to train your heart is to run hard after Jesus yourself. A man who loves Christ will be drawn to a woman who does the same.

And young women—this passage isn’t meant to burden you with unreachable standards. But it does give a picture of what godly beauty looks like. It starts with fearing the Lord. That’s what truly matters. When your heart treasures God above all else, you’ll shine with the beauty that really counts—and you’ll attract the kind of man who sees it.

> [!important]+ Reflect and Respond
Pray about this. Ask God to help you seek him first. And pray that, if he’s calling you to marriage, he would start shaping your heart now to be the kind of man or woman who lives wisely and walks in godliness.
