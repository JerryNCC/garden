### <center>亲吻儿子</center>

> [!info]- 🎙️Audio: [A Daily Devotional - 06.26 - CN]()

旧约圣经中有许多记载以色列的历史，诗篇也是如此。但它们不仅仅是讲以色列的故事，更指向远超以色列的更大盼望——那未来的王，祂将来临。诗篇第二篇清楚地彰显了这一点。

这篇诗一开始描绘列国狂傲反抗神和祂的子民。在当时的历史背景中，这指的是环绕以色列的列国，威胁并攻击神的百姓。但神如何回应呢？祂发笑。列国的喧嚣在掌管万有的神眼中如同笑话一般。神并不忧虑，反而应许要审判一切抵挡祂的列国，并借着祂所膏立的君王施行审判。神说：“我已立我的君王在锡安我的圣山上。”（诗篇2:6）这位君王必承受列国为产业，以大能统治万民。

当人听见这位大君王的统治，应当如何回应呢？诗篇说：“当以圣洁的心敬畏侍奉耶和华，又当存敬畏战兢亲吻他的儿子。”（2:11-12）这里的“亲吻”是表示敬拜，谦卑地俯伏敬重君王。唯有向祂屈服，顺服祂的权柄，才能免受祂审判。

这诗篇原本是为庆祝大卫家族在以色列的统治，但其信息远超人间任何君王。这君王太尊贵，太荣耀，绝非普通人所能完全代表——即使是大卫本人也不能。诗人明显指向弥赛亚，真实的大卫之子。

当我们读诗篇第二篇时，自然而然会想到耶稣基督。祂是真正被神立在宝座上的永远君王。神已将万国赐给耶稣为产业。凡向耶稣俯伏顺服祂权柄的人都是有福的，因为他们在这唯一救主里得着庇护。

> [!important]+ 反思与回应
反思自己：你的言语、思想和行为如何反映你对耶稣的态度？祂是永远掌权的君王。祈求神帮助你谦卑顺服祂的统治。亲吻这位儿子，在祂里面得享平安与祝福。

📖 **Passage to read**: ==Psalm 02==

> [!info]- 🎙️Audio: [A Daily Devotional - 06.28 - EN]()  

Much of the Old Testament, including the Psalms, tells the story of Israel. But it also points beyond Israel to something greater—a future hope and a coming King. Psalm 2 shows this clearly.

The psalm begins by describing the nations raging against God and His people. In its original setting, this probably meant the nations around Israel, threatening and attacking them. But how does God respond? He laughs. The noise of the nations seems like a joke to God, who is in control of everything. God is not worried. Instead, He promises to judge all who oppose Him, and He will do it through His anointed King. God says, “I have set my King on Zion, my holy hill” (2:6). This King will inherit the nations and rule them with power.

What should people do when they hear about this great King? The psalm says they should “serve the Lord with fear” and “kiss the Son” (2:11–12). To “kiss” here means to show respect, bow down, and honor the King humbly. The only way to escape His judgment is to submit to His rule.

At first, this psalm celebrated the rule of David’s family over Israel. But the message goes far beyond any human king. The king in this psalm is too powerful, too glorious, to be just a man—even David. The psalm points to the Messiah, the true Son of David.

When we read Psalm 2, we naturally think of Jesus Christ. He is the true King God has placed on His throne forever. God has given Jesus all the nations as His inheritance. Those who bow before Jesus and submit to His rule are blessed because they find refuge in the one true Savior.

> [!important]+ Reflect and Respond
Ask yourself: How do your words, thoughts, and actions show your attitude toward Jesus? He is the King who rules forever. Pray for God’s help to live humbly under His rule. Kiss the Son, and be blessed as you find safety in Him.
