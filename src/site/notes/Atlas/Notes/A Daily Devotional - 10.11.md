### <center>超过赦免的恩典</center>

> [!info]- 🎙️Audio: [None]()

想一想，你人生中最严重的失败。再想想彼得。他的跌倒比你更深。彼得一向刚强、直率，甚至敢于放下鱼网跟随耶稣。他曾信誓旦旦地说：即便要坐牢、甚至要死，他也绝不离开主。可是当关键时刻来到，他却彻底崩溃了。他三次否认耶稣，最后一次还加上咒诅，为了让谎言更像是真的。就在耶稣最需要他的时候，彼得却转身背离。无论你觉得自己失败得多么严重，你大概都没有像彼得那样跌倒。

也因此，约翰福音第21章格外震撼、格外动人。复活的基督并没有丢弃这位深深失败的门徒。祂以温柔和恩典恢复彼得。耶稣三次问他：“你爱我吗？”原因不难理解——彼得三次否认过祂。每一个问题都像针扎一样，让彼得心里酸痛。但耶稣并不是要羞辱他，而是要他面对自己的失败，好让赦免显得完全彻底。而且，耶稣不只赦免彼得，还托付他使命：“你喂养我的羊。”彼得不仅得着赦免，更被差遣。前面的道路不轻松，会伴随受苦，但却是为复活的主而活、而服事的道路。

这就是约翰福音21章的好消息。彼得最低谷的那一天，并不是他生命的终点。他虽跌倒，却被耶稣重新扶起。他得了赦免，被恢复，并蒙召去承担使命。后来，彼得果真成为伟大的使徒，是初代教会的关键领袖，勇敢地传讲基督。约翰在福音书的结尾，给我们描绘的正是这样的画面：耶稣用恩典扶起一个跌倒的门徒。而这同样的恩典，也属于你。

> [!important]+ 反思与回应
你跌倒过吗？这周你是否也失败过？复活的救主耶稣正在等候，要赦免你，扶起你，恢复你。祂不仅愿意赦免你的罪，还愿意差你出去，为祂的国度而活。失败不必成为你故事的结局。转向耶稣吧！求祂赐下恩典，让祂扶起你，差遣你。

### <center>More Than Forgiveness</center>

> [!question]+ Review
> 1. How did Mary Magdalene and the disciples respond when they saw the empty tomb, and what does this reveal about their understanding of the resurrection at that time?
> 2. Why is Thomas often called “Doubting Thomas,” and how did Jesus respond to his doubt?
> 3. According to John’s account, who turned from confusion, fear, or doubt to faith because of Jesus’s resurrection? What reminder does this give us for our own faith today?

📖 **Passage to read**: ==John 21==

> [!info]- 🎙️Audio: [None]()  

Think of the worst mistake you’ve ever made. Now consider Peter. He failed even more deeply. Peter was bold, strong, and outspoken. He left his fishing to follow Jesus. He promised to stay with his Lord no matter what—even through prison or death. But when the test came, Peter collapsed. He denied Jesus three times, the last time with curses to make it sound convincing. On the very night Jesus needed him, Peter walked away. Whatever you’ve done, you likely haven’t failed as badly as Peter did.

That is why John 21 is so powerful. The risen Christ does not leave Peter behind. With kindness and grace, Jesus restores the disciple who had failed him. Three times, Jesus asks Peter, “Do you love me?” It’s not hard to see why. Peter had denied him three times. The questions sting, and Peter feels hurt, but Jesus is not being cruel. He is helping Peter face his failure honestly, so that his forgiveness will be clear and complete. And Jesus goes further than forgiving Peter. He gives him a calling: “Feed my sheep.” Peter is not only forgiven; he is sent into service. His path will include suffering, but it will also be a life of service to the risen Lord.

This is the good news of John 21. Peter’s lowest moment was not the end of his story. He fell, but Jesus raised him up. He was forgiven, restored, and given work to do. Later, Peter would become one of the great apostles, a leader in the early church, preaching Christ with courage. John closes his Gospel with this picture of grace—Jesus lifting up a fallen disciple. That same grace is offered to you.

> [!important]+ Reflect and Respond
Have you fallen? Have you failed even this week? Jesus, the risen Savior, is ready to forgive and restore you. He not only wants to pardon your sin, but also to put you to work in his kingdom. Your failure does not have to be the final chapter. Turn to Jesus. Ask him for grace. Let him lift you up and send you out.
