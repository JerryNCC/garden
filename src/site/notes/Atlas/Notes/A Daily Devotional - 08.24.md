### <center>耶和华的日子</center>

> [!info]- 🎙️Audio: [None]()

当我们读《约珥书》时，有一个词不断出现，就是“耶和华的日子”。学者们对其确切含义或许有不同的看法，但核心指向的是神对罪的审判，以及祂对祂子民最终的复兴。约珥也让我们看见，这“日子”既有当下的意义，也有将来的应验。神的子民如今因自己的罪经历一些审判，这些经历其实是指向那最终伟大之日的预兆。到那日，神的审判要完全临到，唯有属祂的人必得拯救。

在《约珥书》2:1–17中，我们清楚看见他信息的两个层面。首先是审判。约珥描绘了一个可怕的日子：“黑暗幽冥的日子”，当“有一队强盛的民”攻击以色列（2:2）。火焰焚烧、毁灭的景象充满其间。但最令人震惊的是：这军队的元帅竟是神自己。约珥说：“耶和华在他军旅前发声，他的队伍甚大；成就他命的是强盛者”（2:11）。无论约珥所描述的是一场真实的军事入侵，还是瘟疫或灾难的象征，他的重点都是明确的——这是神亲自掌权，借此施行对祂子民罪的审判。

然而，语调在第十二节转变。神呼召说：“虽然如此，你们应当禁食、哭泣、悲哀，一心归向我。”为何在审判中仍要归向神？因为祂的属性！约珥提醒百姓：“你们要归向耶和华你们的神，因为他有恩典，有怜悯，不轻易发怒，有丰盛的慈爱，并且后悔不降所说的灾”（2:13）。正因祂的性情，才有盼望。所以约珥呼召百姓切实悔改——禁食、祷告、敬拜，尽心归向耶和华。当神的子民如此回应，赦免与复兴的应许总会临到。

> [!important]+ 反思与回应
这呼召至今仍在回响。如今仍有机会，转向耶稣基督，凭着悔改与信心得蒙赦罪与生命。如果你还没有这样做，就当趁早归向祂；若你已经属祂，就当祈求神赐你勇气与喜乐，更大胆地将祂恩典与慈爱的好消息传给别人。

### <center>The Day of the Lord</center>

> [!question]+ Review
> 1.⁠ ⁠How does God promise to restore His relationship with His people? (Hosea 2:14, 19–20)
2.⁠ ⁠What spiritual truth is symbolized by Hosea redeeming his wife? (Hosea 3:1–2)
3.⁠ ⁠According to Hosea 3:5, through whom will this everlasting covenant be established?

📖 **Passage to read**: ==Hosea 02:14-03:05==

> [!info]- 🎙️Audio: [None]()  

When we read Joel, one phrase keeps coming up: *the day of the Lord.* People may argue about exactly what it means, but at its core it points to God’s judgment on sin and the final restoration of His people. And Joel shows us that this “day” can be both present and future. God’s people taste His judgment now in different ways, but those moments are really signs pointing forward to the great and final day of the Lord. On that day, His judgment will be complete, and only those who belong to Him will be saved.

In Joel 2:1–17, we see both sides of his message. First comes judgment. Joel describes a terrifying day: “a day of darkness and gloom” when “a great and powerful people” come against Israel (2:2). The scene is filled with images of fire, flame, and destruction. But the most shocking part is this: it is God Himself who leads the army. “The LORD utters his voice before his army,” Joel says, “for his forces are very great” (2:11). Whether Joel is describing an actual military invasion or a symbolic picture of plague and disaster, his point is clear—God is the one directing it, as He brings judgment on His people’s sin.

But then the tone shifts. In verse 12, God calls out: “Yet even now, return to me with all your heart.” Why should the people return in the middle of judgment? Because of who God is. Joel reminds them: “For he is gracious and merciful, slow to anger, and abounding in steadfast love; and he relents over disaster” (2:13). Because of His character, there is hope. That’s why Joel calls the people to repentance—fasting, prayer, worship, and turning back to God with all their heart. When His people do that, there is always the promise of forgiveness and restoration.

That same call still rings out today. Even now, there is time to turn to Jesus Christ in repentance and faith, and find forgiveness and life. If you have not done that, make sure you do. And if you already belong to Him, ask God to make you bold and joyful in sharing with others the good news of His grace and mercy.
