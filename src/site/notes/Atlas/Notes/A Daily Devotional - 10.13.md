### <center>耶稣差遣圣灵</center>

> [!info]- 🎙️Audio: [None]()

门徒们在等候——正如耶稣吩咐他们的。他曾经嘱咐他们，不要离开耶路撒冷，而是要等候父所应许的，就是圣灵的降临（1:4）。这是何等大的应许！这应许将改变一切，赐给他们能力，使他们能为耶稣作见证。

终于，事情发生了。在五旬节那日，耶稣的门徒们聚集在一处。忽然，有响声从天而来，好像一阵大风，充满了他们所坐的屋子；又有舌头如火焰显现出来，停在他们各人头上（2:2–3）。圣灵降临了！耶稣的应许此刻实现。门徒们随即走出屋子，在圣灵的带领下开始用各国的语言传讲耶稣。众人惊讶不已——来自不同地方的人，都听见他们用自己的乡谈讲论耶稣。那些人大多是加利利的犹太人，怎么可能会说外邦人的语言呢？有人讥笑他们，但更多的人则惊奇不已。这到底意味着什么？

想一想：在耶稣死而复活之后，基督信仰何其渺小。只剩下一群门徒，一些妇女，和少数跟随者，畏惧地蜷缩在耶路撒冷的一间屋子里。可是，如今看看世界：各国各地的人敬拜复活的主耶稣基督；无数的教会遍布世界；福音每天都在改变成千上万人的生命。是什么带来了这样的转变？答案就是——《使徒行传》第二章。耶稣差遣圣灵，赋予这小小的群体力量，使他们把福音传扬开来。整卷《使徒行传》将向我们叙述这使命在第一世纪如何展开，如何从耶路撒冷开始扩展到万邦。福音成长，耶稣的信息奇妙地进入人心，改变生命。

> [!important]+ 反思与回应
这其中的奇迹也包括了你。你今日之所以能听见并相信这福音，正是圣灵在你生命中的作为。上帝藉着圣灵，将救恩的信息托付给那一群畏惧的男女，如今却传遍了世界，也传到了你的耳中。今天，让我们为圣灵感谢上帝，因为祂使你认识耶稣。也求祂赐你勇气，把这位救主分享给更多人。

### <center>Jesus sends the Holy Spirit</center>

> [!question]+ Review
> 1. How does Peter’s threefold denial of Jesus help us better understand Jesus’s restoration and forgiveness in John 21?
> 2. What is the significance of Jesus asking Peter three times, “Do you love me?” and then commissioning him to “feed my sheep”?
> 3. How does John 21 teach us that, even after failure, Jesus can still forgive, restore, and use us?

📖 **Passage to read**: ==使徒行传 02:01-13==

> [!info]- 🎙️Audio: [None]()  

The disciples were waiting—just as Jesus had told them. He had instructed them not to leave Jerusalem, but to wait for the Father’s promise: the coming of the Holy Spirit (1:4). This promise would change everything. It would give them the power they needed to be his witnesses.

Then it happened. On the day of Pentecost, the followers of Jesus were gathered together in one place. Suddenly, a sound like a mighty wind filled the house, and something like tongues of fire rested on each of them (2:2–3). The Holy Spirit had come. Jesus’s promise was now a reality. The disciples went out, and as the Spirit led them, they began speaking about Jesus in other languages. People were stunned—foreigners were hearing about Jesus in their own tongues, from men who were mostly uneducated Jews. Some mocked, but many were amazed. What was going on?

Think about it: right after Jesus’s death and resurrection, Christianity was small. A handful of disciples. Some women. A few other followers, huddled together in fear. Now, look at today. All over the world, people worship Jesus Christ, the risen Lord. Churches in countless countries. The gospel changing lives every single day. What made the difference? Acts 2. Jesus sent the Holy Spirit to empower his followers to proclaim the gospel everywhere. The rest of Acts will tell us how that mission began, spreading across the first-century world. The gospel grew. The message of Jesus took hold of hearts and transformed lives.

> [!important]+ Reflect and Respond
And here’s the miracle: you, too, know and believe this good news. That’s the work of the Spirit in your life. God took a small group of fearful men and women and, through the Spirit, sent his message around the world—reaching even us today. So thank God for the Spirit, who made Jesus known to you. And ask him for courage to share this Savior with others.
