### <center>大葡萄与更大的恐惧</center>

> [!info]- 🎙️Audio: [A Daily Devotional - 02.22 - CN]()

在这一章中，神命令摩西派人去“窥探迦南地”（13:2）。这是一个激动人心的时刻——神即将兑现祂对祂百姓的应许，他们也正准备占领应许之地！于是，探子们出发了。他们考察那片土地，观察那里的百姓，并带回了一个巨大的葡萄串，重得需要两个人才能抬得动！经过四十天的调查，他们将报告带回给以色列百姓。听听大部分探子们怎么说：“那地的居民很强大，城市又大又坚固，我们还看见那里有亚拿克的后代”（13:28）。

自然，这份报告让百姓感到非常恐惧。他们开始哭泣，抱怨领袖们。为什么他们仍然没有准备好进入应许之地？因为他们并没有完全信靠神。他们怀疑神的能力，且比信靠神更多的是害怕那地的居民。

尽管这段经文充满悲伤，但其中也有希望。两个人——约书亚和迦勒——坚定地站在信仰上。尽管其他十个探子都感到害怕，约书亚和迦勒却信靠神。我们以后会更多了解约书亚，但在这里，是迦勒站出来说话。他对那些恐惧的探子们和正在哭泣的百姓说：“我们立刻上去占领那地，因为我们足以克服它”（13:30）。迦勒相信神会赐给他们胜利，并带领他们进入祂所应许的地。迦勒和约书亚是唯一相信神的信实的人。不幸的是，迦勒的话被其他探子的恐惧声音淹没，但他为我们树立了一个榜样，展示了神的百姓在面对困难时应有的正确态度。

> [!important]+ 反思与回应
我们常常像这一章中的探子一样——容易被眼前的环境所吓倒，并迅速怀疑神的能力、良善与主权。今天，让我们向神祈求，求祂帮助我们完全信靠祂。记住，祂已经应许在我们跟随耶稣的过程中看顾我们。相信祂会继续忠实地完成在我们生命中的工作。

### <center>Big Grapes and Bigger Fear</center>

> [!question]+ Review
> 1.⁠ ⁠Why did Aaron and Miriam oppose Moses' leadership? What was the core issue?
> 2.⁠ ⁠Why did God respond so quickly and severely to Aaron and Miriam’s rebellion? What warning does God’s response hold for us?
> 3.⁠ ⁠What lessons can we learn from Moses’ relationship with God about God’s appointed leaders for His people?

📖 **Passage to read**: ==Numbers 13==

> [!info]- 🎙️Audio: [A Daily Devotional - 02.22 - EN]()  

In this chapter, God tells Moses to send men to “spy out the land of Canaan” (13:2). This is an exciting moment—God is about to fulfill the promise He made to His people, and they are getting ready to take possession of the land! So, the spies set out. They explore the land, observe the people, and return with a large cluster of grapes so big it takes two men to carry! After forty days of investigating, they bring their report back to the people. Listen to what most of the spies say: “The people who live in the land are strong, and the cities are fortified and very large. And we even saw the descendants of Anak there” (13:28).

Naturally, this report terrifies the people. They become afraid and begin to cry and grumble against their leaders. Why are they still not ready to enter the promised land? It’s because they don’t fully trust God. They doubt His power, and they fear the people of the land more than they trust God.

While this passage is sad, there is hope. Two men—Joshua and Caleb—stand firm in their faith. While the other ten spies are scared, Joshua and Caleb trust God. We’ll hear more about Joshua later, but here, it’s Caleb who speaks up. He says to the frightened spies and the people who are crying, “Let us go up at once and occupy [the land], for we are well able to overcome it” (13:30). Caleb believes that God will give them victory and bring them into the land He promised. Caleb and Joshua are the only ones who believe in God’s faithfulness. Unfortunately, Caleb’s words are drowned out by the fear of the other spies, but he sets an example for the right attitude that God’s people should have when facing challenges.

> [!important]+ Reflect and Respond
We can be just like the spies in this chapter—easily intimidated and quick to doubt God’s power, goodness, and sovereignty. Today, let’s ask God to help us trust Him fully. Remember that He has promised to keep us as we follow Jesus. Believe that He will remain faithful to complete the work He has started in us.
