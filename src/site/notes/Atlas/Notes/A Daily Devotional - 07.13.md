### <center>神为婚姻所设的旨意</center>

> [!info]- 🎙️Audio: [A Daily Devotional - 07.13 - CN]()

在当今世界，到处充斥着有关性的讯息。不论是杂志广告、电影、歌曲，还是电视节目，几乎无处不在。世界不断地向我们传递一个观念：性是刺激、有趣、自由的——任何时候、和任何人都可以随意享受，毫无约束。然而，圣经并不否定性的美好。恰恰相反，它教导我们：性是上帝所创造的，是良善的。但祂也设立了性应存在的特定范围，就是婚姻之中。若越界而行，性就像野火一样，所到之处尽是毁灭与伤害。

在《箴言》第五章中，所罗门对儿子提出有关性诱惑的劝勉。他并没有说性是污秽或可耻的。事实上，他鼓励儿子在婚姻中享受这份恩赐。“要喝自己池中的水，”他写道（箴5:15）。这是一个比喻，表示要享受自己的配偶。他又说：“要喜悦你幼年所娶的妻”（箴5:18）。圣经在这方面毫不含糊，它赞美婚姻中的性爱，把它当作出于上帝的美好礼物。

然而，所罗门也清楚警告说，婚姻之外的性诱惑极具危险。他描述那引诱人的妇人：“她嘴唇滴下蜂蜜，她的口比油更滑”（箴5:3）。换句话说，这样的罪在表面上看来非常诱人，听起来也十分美好。因为性本是与愉悦连结的，是上帝的赐福，我们堕落的心便容易在这方面跌倒。但所罗门直言不讳地指出：婚姻之外的性关系只会带来痛苦与破坏。“她的脚下陷入死亡”（箴5:5）。这样的关系从不兑现它的承诺，只会叫人失去更多。

那么，我们该如何回应？所罗门给出一个明确的答案：远离诱惑。“你当使道路离她远，不可就近她的房门”（箴5:8）。抵挡性诱惑最有效的方式，就是从一开始就避开它。

> [!important]+ 反思与回应
向上帝祷告，求祂赐你更深地爱主耶稣，胜过爱罪的心。即使你现在在性纯洁方面做得不错，也要求祂坚固你的心志，使你继续遵行祂为性所设立的美好旨意。仰望基督，在你跟随祂的道路上，为了祂的荣耀，持守圣洁的生活。

📖 **Passage to read**: ==Proverbs 05==

> [!info]- 🎙️Audio: [A Daily Devotional - 07.13 - EN]()  

Our world today is full of messages about sex. It’s in magazine ads, movies, songs, and TV shows. Everywhere you look, it seems like the world is telling you that sex is exciting, fun, and completely free—something you can enjoy any time, with anyone, no strings attached. And honestly, the Bible doesn’t say sex is bad. In fact, it says the opposite. God created sex, and He meant it to be good. But He also gave it a purpose. Sex is meant to be enjoyed within marriage. Outside of that, it can do a lot of damage—like a fire burning out of control.

In Proverbs 5, Solomon speaks to his son about sexual temptation. He doesn’t say sex is dirty or shameful. In fact, he encourages his son to enjoy it—within marriage. “Drink water from your own cistern,” Solomon writes (5:15). That’s a picture of enjoying your own spouse. Later, he says, “Rejoice in the wife of your youth” (5:18). The Bible isn’t shy here. It celebrates sex—but only when it’s shared between a husband and wife.

The danger, Solomon warns, is giving in to sexual temptation outside of marriage. He describes the tempting words of a woman who is not his son’s wife: “Her lips drip honey,” and “her speech is smoother than oil” (5:3). In other words, sin in this area always looks good at first. It sounds sweet and exciting. Because sex feels good—it’s a gift from God—our sinful hearts want it badly. But Solomon tells us the truth: sex outside of marriage leads to pain. “Her feet go down to death” (5:5). Sinful sex never gives what it promises. It only takes.

So what should we do? Solomon gives a clear answer: stay away. “Keep your way far from her,” he says. “Do not go near the door of her house” (5:8). The best way to fight sexual sin is to avoid temptation from the start.

> [!important]+ Reflect and Respond
Ask God to help you love Jesus more than you love sin. Ask Him to guard your heart. Even if you’re not struggling with sexual sin right now, ask Him to keep you strong and focused on His good plan. Keep trusting Christ, and as you walk with Him, choose sexual purity—not just for yourself, but for God’s glory.
