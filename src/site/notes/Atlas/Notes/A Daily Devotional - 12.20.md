### <center>在耶稣眼中伟大</center>

> [!info]- 🎙️Audio: [None]()


在这段经文中，耶稣向两间教会说话——撒狄教会和非拉铁非教会。你会注意到，对每间教会，耶稣的信息略有不同。大多数教会的信息中都有鼓励和挑战的成分，但通常总体倾向要么是责备，要么是安慰。当你思考耶稣对这两间教会的话时，也可以想想他今天会对你所在的教会说什么。

撒狄看起来是一间信仰已经枯竭、失去生命、甚至表面虚假的教会。他们“有活着的名声”（3:1）——这是一间知名且受尊敬的教会！然而，耶稣发现他们有问题。面对这种死寂和缺乏真实信心的生活，解决之道是什么呢？**就是悔改**。耶稣告诉他们：“要醒悟！”（3:3）这是一群起初信心坚强的人，但他们已经失去了喜乐、生命，以及信仰的真正根基。罪恶潜入了他们的群体，导致敬拜枯干、不真诚。现在是撒狄悔改、醒悟、并记起信心起初的福音的时候了。

耶稣对非拉铁非教会的话语语气则完全不同（不要与美国的费城混淆！）。这是一间与撒狄截然不同的教会；他们“权势不大”（3:8），并没有显赫的名声。然而，他们获得了耶稣能赐予的最高称赞之一：“你遵守我的道，没有弃绝我的名”（3:8）。这间小教会——在世人眼中软弱——却在逼迫和苦难中为耶稣坚立不移。他们持守“忍耐到底”，没有放弃福音（3:10）。对于这间教会，耶稣的话全是鼓励。他指向未来那一天，他们将在“我神的城里”与他永远同在（3:12）。非拉铁非这间小教会比撒狄这间有伟大名声的教会更忠信，而最重要的是，这是耶稣的看法！

> [!important]+ 反思与回应 
你今天是否需要听到耶稣对你说：“醒悟！”？如果需要，就倾听他的话！如果你需要悔改罪过，就现在在神面前悔改。如果你需要被提醒福音的重要性，就花更多时间在神的话语中。让耶稣对这些教会的话语直接触动你的心和生命！

📖 **Passage to read**: ==Revelation 01:04-20==

> [!info]- 🎙️Audio: [None]()  


Of all the various parts, sections, and scenes of the book of Revelation, the first three chapters are probably the easiest to understand. In fact, what we find in these chapters is not unlike what we see in many other New Testament books: letters to ancient Christian churches. But there is something especially powerful about these seven letters: Jesus Christ himself dictates them to John. The risen and glorified Lord Jesus spoke these words to those ancient churches. We need to hear these today, and we should pay close attention!

Let’s back up for a moment. John tells us that he was on the island of Patmos—exiled there as a criminal because of his faith in Jesus Christ and for preaching the gospel. John is old by this time and quite possibly discouraged. Yet it is on this island that John receives this astounding vision from God. This vision will be a grand, cosmic vision for the entire world. The book of Revelation shows us the end of the grand story of God’s redemption! But we see in this passage that John’s vision had another purpose as well. It was written—originally—for churches that were enduring persecution for the sake of Jesus Christ.

What is the first thing that Jesus wants to make sure these churches understand? It’s that he is utterly in control—reigning as the risen and sovereign King over all creation. Listen again to what Jesus says to John as the apostle lies prostrate before him: “Fear not, I am the first and the last, and the living one. I died, and behold I am alive forevermore, and I have the keys of Death and Hades” (1:17–18). Jesus comes to John—and these seven ancient churches—first with a reminder of his resurrection and his power. Jesus is reigning. Even their persecution hasn’t changed that! And it will be this glorious Savior and King who will speak powerful, encouraging, and challenging words to these seven churches. They will be words that we need to hear today as well!

> [!important]+ Reflect and Respond
_As you think about this passage, remember that Jesus himself appeared to John in order to speak these words to these seven churches. Ask God to prepare your heart to listen to Jesus in the book of Revelation! Pray that your vision of Jesus, as you hear his words, would be the right one—a vision of the reigning and sovereign King of the entire earth._
