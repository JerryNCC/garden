### <center>顺服胜于献祭</center>

> [!info]- 🎙️Audio: [A Daily Devotional - 04.10 - CN]()


在扫罗刚刚加冕为王后不久，神通过撒母耳向他传达了一个重要的命令：消灭亚玛力人。为什么是亚玛力人？因为几个世纪前，当以色列人从埃及出发后，在旷野中，亚玛力人攻击了他们。神没有忘记这件事。祂曾承诺将永远与亚玛力人作战。现在，作为新王的扫罗，被赋予了履行神向祂的百姓所做的承诺的责任——彻底摧毁他们的敌人。

扫罗与亚玛力人展开战争，亚玛力王亚甲也在其中，扫罗取得了伟大的胜利。他摧毁了亚玛力的军队和大部分人民。但在第9节，有一个“然而”——扫罗和他的军队 spared了亚玛力的王和最好的牲畜。神命令彻底消灭亚玛力人，但扫罗并没有完全遵守。

当撒母耳到达时，事情变得更加糟糕。扫罗坚持说他已经完全遵守了神的命令，并将 spared 亚玛力王和牲畜的责任推给了百姓，而不是作为领袖亲自承担责任。他最终承认了自己的不顺从，但很明显他希望能快速修复自己的错误，而不是发自内心的悔改。甚至在与撒母耳的对话结束时，扫罗似乎更关心自己在士兵面前的形象，而不是自己与神的关系。然而，撒母耳再次告诉他，因为他的心不顺服并拒绝神的命令，神将把王国从他手中夺去，另立一个拥有合神心意的人的王来领导祂的百姓。

在这一章的中间，撒母耳通过一首简短的诗歌向扫罗传达了神的重要信息，这首诗出现在第22到23节。这首诗总结了神对祂百姓的期望。神不需要单纯的献祭；祂要的是顺服。祂不需要空洞的仪式，祂要的是那些听从祂话语并遵守的人。神最终所寻求的是那些完全献身给祂的心。而这正是扫罗所缺乏的地方。这也是为何大卫会被神拣选成为领导祂百姓的王。

> [!important]+ 反思与回应
今天，祈求神通过圣灵帮助你在生命中消除罪恶。不要让罪恶在你生命中逗留，让某些部分没有被神的同在触及。与神通过基督的和平意味着与罪作战——全力消除它！

### <center>Under Pressure</center>

> [!question]+ Review
> 1. Why did Saul fail to fully obey God's command in 1 Samuel 13? What were the reasons and underlying mindset behind his actions?
> 2. What issues does Saul’s decision to offer the sacrifice himself, instead of waiting for Samuel, reveal about his heart? How did this affect his relationship with God?
> 3. How can we avoid making the same mistake as Saul by relying on our own judgment in times of pressure and challenges, instead of obeying God’s command? What practical steps can you take to develop a heart of obedience to God?

📖 **Passage to read**: ==1 Samuel 15==

> [!info]- 🎙️Audio: [A Daily Devotional - 04.10 - EN]()  

Shortly after Saul is crowned king, God gives him an important command through Samuel: destroy the Amalekites. Why the Amalekites? It’s because centuries earlier, when the Israelites were in the wilderness after leaving Egypt, the Amalekites attacked them. God hasn’t forgotten that. He promised that He would be at war with the Amalekites forever. Now, Saul, as the new king, is given the responsibility to carry out God’s promise to His people by completely destroying their enemies.

Saul goes to war against the Amalekites, led by their king Agag, and wins a great victory. He destroys their army and most of their people. But here’s the big “but” in verse 9—Saul and his army spare the Amalekite king and the best of their animals. God had commanded the total destruction of the Amalekites, but Saul doesn’t obey fully.

When Samuel arrives, things take a turn for the worse. Saul insists that he has obeyed God completely, and he blames the people for sparing the Amalekite king and animals, rather than taking responsibility as their leader. He eventually admits his disobedience, but it’s clear he hopes for a quick fix rather than a true heart of repentance. Even when his conversation with Samuel is over, Saul seems more concerned about his reputation in front of his men than about his relationship with God. Samuel, however, tells him again that because of his disobedient heart and rejection of God’s command, the kingdom will be taken from him and given to someone else—someone who has a heart for God.

In the middle of this chapter, Samuel delivers a key message to Saul in the form of a short poem, found in verses 22–23. This poem summarizes what God desires from His people. God doesn’t want mere sacrifices; He wants obedience. He doesn’t want empty rituals—He wants people who listen to His word and obey it. What God ultimately seeks is hearts that are fully committed to Him. And this is where Saul fails. This is also why David will be set apart as the king God chooses to lead His people.

> [!important]+ Reflect and Respond
Today, pray that God would help you—through the Holy Spirit—to put to death the sin in your life. Don’t let sin linger around, leaving some areas of your life untouched by God’s presence. True peace with God through Christ means war with sin—fight it with the goal of completely eliminating it!
