### Essay Question: Identification of an Unknown Salt

You are provided with an unknown salt. Your task is to identify the salt by performing a series of tests and making step-by-step deductions based on your observations. 
#### Information:
- **Appearance of the Salt**: The unknown salt appears as a **blue crystalline solid**.

#### Heating of the salt
- **Observation**: The salt releases gas that turns **blue litmus paper to red**. 

#### Tests for Cation and Anion:

1. **Test for Cation (Metal Ion)**:
    - **Procedure**: Add a few drops of **sodium hydroxide (NaOH)** solution to a small amount of the salt solution.
    - **Observation**: A **light blue precipitate** forms.
> [!info]- Deduction
>  This precipitate is **copper(II) hydroxide (Cu(OH)₂)**. This confirms the presence of **copper(II) ions (Cu²⁺)**.

2. **Test for Anion (Non-Metal Ion)**:
    - **Procedure**: Add **barium chloride (BaCl₂)** solution to a small amount of the salt solution, followed by a few drops of **dilute hydrochloric acid (HCl)**.
    - **Observation**: A **white precipitate** forms. 
> [!info]- Deduction
> **barium sulphate (BaSO₄)** forms, which is insoluble in dilute hydrochloric acid. This confirms the presence of **sulphate ions (SO₄²⁻)**.

#### Confirmatory Tests:

1. **Confirmatory Test**:
    - **Procedure**: Add **ammonia solution (NH₃)** drop by drop to the salt solution.
    - **Observation**: A **light blue precipitate** forms initially, which dissolves in excess ammonia to form a **deep blue solution**.
> [!info]- Deduction
> This confirms the presence of Copper.

#### Task:
Based on the information provided and the results from the tests, identify the unknown salt. Write a detailed essay that outlines each step of the process, from observing the appearance of the salt, conducting the tests for the cation and anion, and applying the confirmatory tests. Your deductions should lead to the identification of the salt.

> [!warning]- Answer:
> - **Copper Sulphate (CuSO₄)** is known for its distinctive **blue** color.
> - The formation of a **light blue precipitate** with **sodium hydroxide** and a **deep blue solution** with excess **ammonia** confirms **copper(II) ions (Cu²⁺)**.
> - The **white precipitate** with **barium chloride** that remains insoluble in **dilute hydrochloric acid** confirms the presence of **sulphate ions (SO₄²⁻)**.
