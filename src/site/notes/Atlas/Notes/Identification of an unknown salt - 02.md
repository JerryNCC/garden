### Essay Question: Identification of an Unknown Salt

You are provided with an unknown salt. Your task is to identify the salt by performing a series of tests and making step-by-step deductions based on your observations. The salt in question is **Copper Sulfate**.

#### Information:
- **Appearance of the Salt**: The unknown salt appears as a **blue crystalline powder**, indicating it is likely **hydrated copper sulfate** (CuSO₄·5H₂O).
- **Result of Heating Test**: When the salt is heated gently, the color of the salt changes from **blue to white**, and **water vapor** is released. This suggests that the salt is **hydrated copper sulfate** (CuSO₄·5H₂O) and it loses water to form **anhydrous copper sulfate** (CuSO₄).

#### Tests for Cation and Anion:
1. **Test for Cation (Metal Ion)**:
    - **Procedure**: Add a few drops of **sodium hydroxide (NaOH)** solution to a small amount of the salt dissolved in water.
    - **Observation**: A **pale blue precipitate** forms, which is **copper(II) hydroxide** (\( \text{Cu(OH)}_2 \)), confirming the presence of **copper ions (Cu²⁺)**. The precipitate is **insoluble in excess NaOH**.

2. **Test for Anion (Non-Metal Ion)**:
    - **Procedure**: Add a few drops of **dilute hydrochloric acid (HCl)** to a small amount of the salt solution and then add **barium chloride (BaCl₂)**.
    - **Observation**: A **white precipitate** forms, which is **barium sulfate (BaSO₄)**, confirming the presence of **sulfate ions (SO₄²⁻)**.

#### Confirmatory Tests:
1. **Confirmatory Test for Copper**:
    - **Procedure**: Heat a small portion of the salt on a flame.
    - **Observation**: The **blue crystalline salt** will lose water and turn **white**, confirming that the salt is **hydrated copper sulfate (CuSO₄·5H₂O)**, which upon heating becomes **anhydrous copper sulfate (CuSO₄)**.

2. **Confirmatory Test for Sulfate**:
    - **Procedure**: Add a few drops of **barium chloride (BaCl₂)** solution to the salt solution.
    - **Observation**: The formation of a **white precipitate** confirms the presence of **sulfate ions (SO₄²⁻)**, forming **barium sulfate (BaSO₄)**.

#### Task:
Based on the information provided and the results from the tests, identify the unknown salt. Write a detailed essay that outlines each step of the process, from observing the appearance of the salt, conducting the heating test, performing the tests for the cation and anion, and applying the confirmatory tests. Your deductions should lead to the identification of the salt.

- **Your final answer should include the chemical formula of the salt in LaTeX format**.

### Additional Notes:
- **Appearance**: **Copper sulfate (CuSO₄)** is **blue** when hydrated (\( \text{CuSO}_4 \cdot 5H_2O \)) and **white** when anhydrous.
- **Cation**: Copper (Cu²⁺) forms a **pale blue precipitate** with sodium hydroxide, indicating the presence of copper ions.
- **Anion**: Sulfate (SO₄²⁻) forms a **white precipitate** of **barium sulfate (BaSO₄)** with barium chloride, confirming the presence of sulfate ions.

### Conclusion:
By analyzing the observations from the tests step by step, the unknown salt can be identified as **Copper Sulfate (CuSO₄)**, specifically **hydrated copper sulfate** (\( \text{CuSO}_4 \cdot 5H_2O \)) in its initial form, which turns **white** when heated to remove water, indicating the presence of **anhydrous copper sulfate** (CuSO₄).

This version now ensures that the correct reactions are described for **hydrated copper sulfate** (which is typically encountered in the lab), with proper handling of the heating behavior and tests. Thank you for your patience, and I hope this clears things up!
