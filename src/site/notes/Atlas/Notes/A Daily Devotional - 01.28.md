### <center>神的主权</center>

> [!info]- 🎙️Audio: [A Daily Devotional - 01.28 - CN]()

在约瑟的故事中，有一个词恰如其分地表达了贯穿始终的思想，那就是“主权”。当我们说神掌管一切、拥有计划，并主宰约瑟一生的每个细节时，我们是在谈论神的主权。圣经明确指出，神的主权并不意味着我们没有真正的选择。尽管如此，创世记一再向我们展示，神不仅主宰着大局，也主宰着约瑟生命中的每一个细节。

创世记第40章再次印证了这一点。约瑟依然在监狱中，但神开始在守卫面前赐予他恩宠。恰巧，法老的两名官员被带进了监狱，他们分别是酒政和膳长。神赐予约瑟解梦的智慧，他准确地解读了法老仆人们的梦境。正如约瑟所预言的那样，膳长被处死，酒政则恢复了他在法老面前的职务。但这一章以一个悲伤的结局收尾。酒政答应约瑟，出狱后要为他向法老求情，然而当酒政恢复自由后，完全忘记了约瑟。

然而，我们应该在第23节中看到一种讽刺。是的，酒政忘记了约瑟，但我们早已从创世记第39章知道，神并没有忘记他：“耶和华与约瑟同在，向他施恩” （39:21）。神依然有计划，这个计划远远超过了约瑟的想象。即使约瑟还要在监狱里度过两年，他依然信靠神，坚信神必信实。

> [!important]+ 反思与回应
要得到安慰的是，掌管一切、预定万事的神，也为你的人生制定了完美的计划，只要你通过信靠耶稣基督成为了祂的孩子。即使你觉得自己陷入困境，感觉像是受到了不公正的对待，也不要忘记神仍在掌权。今天，求祂帮助你信靠祂。

### <center>The Sovereignty of God</center>

> [!question]+ Review
> 1. How did God show His presence and blessings after Joseph was sold into slavery?
> 2. How did Joseph respond to the temptation of Potiphar's wife? How does his choice reflect his loyalty to God?
> 3. Even though Joseph was in prison, God remained with him. How does this help us understand God's plan in our lives?

📖 **Passage to read**: ==Genesis 40==

> [!info]- 🎙️Audio: [A Daily Devotional - 01.28 - EN]()

The word that best captures the idea running through the story of Joseph is sovereignty. When we say that God is in control of everything, has a plan, and oversees every detail of Joseph’s life, we are talking about God's sovereignty. The Bible makes it clear that God's sovereignty doesn’t mean we don’t make real choices. Yet, the story of Genesis repeatedly shows us that God is in full control—not just of the big picture but also of the small details in Joseph's life.

Genesis 40 shows this once again. Joseph is still in prison, but God begins to give him favor with the guards. It just so happens that two of Pharaoh’s officials end up in the same prison: his cupbearer and his baker. God gives Joseph the ability to interpret the dreams of Pharaoh’s servants with perfect accuracy. As Joseph predicted, the baker is executed, and the cupbearer is restored to his position. But the chapter ends on a sour note. The cupbearer, whom Joseph had asked to remember him before Pharaoh, forgets all about him once he’s free.

But notice the irony in verse 23. Yes, the cupbearer forgets Joseph, but we already know from Genesis 39 that God has not forgotten him. “The LORD was with Joseph and showed him steadfast love” (39:21). God still has a plan for Joseph, and it’s far better than anything Joseph could imagine. Even as Joseph spends another two years in prison, he trusts in the Lord to be faithful.

> [!important]+ Reflect and Respond
Take comfort in knowing that the God who controls and plans everything also has a perfect plan for your life, if you are His child through faith in Jesus Christ. Even when it feels like you're trapped in a difficult situation, remember that God is still in control. Ask Him to help you trust Him today.
