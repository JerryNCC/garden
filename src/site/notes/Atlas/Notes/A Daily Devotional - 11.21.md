### <center>基督徒的“穿戴”</center>

> [!info]- 🎙️Audio: [None]()


我们的文化对衣服非常着迷，不是吗？我们在衣服上花费大量金钱——名牌牛仔裤动辄几百美元。许多人甚至相信，穿什么衣服能彰显自己的身份和地位。保罗在歌罗西书 3:1–17 中也提到类似的道理，但他并不是在讲棉布或牛仔布的衣服，而是在讲我们生活的“衣裳”——我们的行为、言语和思想。保罗说，这些才真正展示了我们的身份。

保罗在开头提出了一个重要的“如果”：“你们若与基督一同复活，就当寻求上面的事”（3:1）。他关于如何“穿戴自己”的所有教导，都建立在这个问题之上。你真的与基督同复活了吗？你是否带着悔改和对罪的悲伤来到耶稣面前，并全心信靠、完全顺服他？如果答案是肯定的，保罗的话就与你息息相关。

保罗的第一个命令很直接：把罪“治死”。那些因基督而得赦免的人，应当彻底与祂为之舍命的罪断绝关系。“治死”（3:5）这个词意味深长——没有妥协的余地。信徒应当“脱去旧人”，就像丢弃那件脏污破旧的衣服一样（3:9）。

那么，我们该“穿上”什么呢？我们应当穿上基督的品格——他的美德与性情。仁慈、善良、谦卑、饶恕、爱心、和平。总之，我们要越来越像耶稣。这才是基督徒应当穿戴的“衣裳”。

> [!important]+ 反思与回应
如果属灵的“穿戴”显明我们的身份，不妨停下来问自己：今天我的属灵衣裳如何？我是否每天都在治死罪恶？我是否在穿上基督的样式？祷告吧，求神让你对耶稣的信心在你的性格、言语和思想上显明出来。求神帮助你与罪恶奋力争战，更加穿戴上救主的美好品格。

### <center>Christian Clothing</center>

> [!question]+ Review

📖 **Passage to read**: ==Colossians 03:01-17==

> [!info]- 🎙️Audio: [None]()  

Our culture is obsessed with clothes. We spend so much money on them—designer jeans can cost hundreds of dollars. Many people have been taught to think that what we wear says something about who we are. Paul makes a similar point in Colossians 3:1–17, but he is not talking about cotton or denim. He is talking about the clothing of our lives—our thoughts, our words, and our actions. These things show our true identity.

Paul begins with one important “if”: “If then you have been raised with Christ” (3:1). Everything he says about dressing ourselves depends on this question. Have you truly been raised with Christ? Have you come to him with repentance for your sins and surrendered your life to him in faith? If so, Paul’s words apply to you.

His first command is stark: put sin to death. Those forgiven by Christ are called to rid themselves of the sins for which he died. The phrase “put to death” (3:5) is strong—it leaves no room for compromise. Christians are to “put off the old self,” like throwing away filthy, worn-out clothes (3:9).

Then what should we put on? We are to put on the clothing of Christ—his character and virtues. Compassion. Kindness. Humility. Forgiveness. Love. Peace. In short, we are to look more and more like Jesus. This is the clothing Christians are to wear.

> [!important]+ Reflect and Respond
If your spiritual clothing shows your identity, pause and ask: how am I dressed today? Am I putting sin to death daily? Am I clothing myself with Christlikeness? Pray that your faith in Jesus will be visible in your character, words, and thoughts. Ask God to help you fight sin and to clothe yourself more and more with the character of your Savior.
