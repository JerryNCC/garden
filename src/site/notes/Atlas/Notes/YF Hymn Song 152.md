1.你是我依靠的力量
你是我寻求的宝藏
你是我的一切

你好比贵重的珍宝
我怎能舍弃你不要
你是我的一切

耶稣神羔羊
配得大赞美
耶稣神羔羊
配得大赞美

2.担当我罪债和羞辱
死里复活我蒙救赎
你是我的一切

当我跌倒你扶持我
当我干渴你充满我
你是我的一切

You are my strength when I am weak  
You are the treasure that I seek  
You are my all in all  
Seeking You as a precious jewel  
Lord, to give up I'd be a fool  
You are my all in all

Taking my sin, my cross, my shame  
Rising up again I bless Your name  
You are my all in all  
When I fall down You pick me up  
When I am dry You fill my cup  
You are my all in all

Jesus, Lamb of God  
Worthy is Your name  
Jesus, Lamb of God  
Worthy is Your name

You are my strength when I am weak  
You are the treasure that I seek  
You are my all in all  
Seeking You as a precious jewel  
Lord, to give up I'd be a fool  
You are my all in all

Taking my sin, my cross, my shame  
Rising up again I bless Your name  
You are my all in all  
When I fall down You pick me up  
When I get dry You fill my cup  
You are my all in all

Jesus, Lamb of God  
Worthy is Your name  
Jesus, Lamb of God  
Worthy is Your name
