### <center>太初有道</center>

> [!info]- 🎙️Audio: [None]()


我们在不同的场合，会用不同的方式介绍自己。若是对一群篮球营的年轻人讲话，我可能会说：“我叫Jon，我热爱篮球，也打了很多年。”若是遇见正在阅读荷马史诗《奥德赛》的人，我或许会提到我大学时主修英国文学。福音书的作者们也有类似的做法。想想马太：他要表明耶稣是应许的弥赛亚和合法的君王，所以从家谱开始。马可想要快速而清楚地讲述耶稣的福音，所以一开头就直接进入故事，没有任何铺陈。路加谨慎记录历史细节，因此从有条理的记载起头。但约翰却是写给全世界的。他最关心的是人能够信耶稣基督。因此，他没有从家族背景或历史资料着手，而是直接指出耶稣真正的身份与本质。

耶稣是谁呢？约翰告诉我们，耶稣就是那永恒的“道”。“太初有道，道与神同在，道就是神。这道太初与神同在。”（约1:1–2）耶稣自起初就存在，祂完全是神，从来都是神。祂参与创造，约翰说：“万物是借着祂造的；凡被造的，没有一样不是借着祂造的。”（约1:3）一切的存在都因祂而有。

接着，约翰带来一个令人惊奇的真理：这永恒的“道”成了肉身，住在我们中间（约1:14）。这里“住”字，也可译作“支搭帐幕”。在摩西的时代，神的荣耀曾充满会幕，那是旷野中的帐棚；如今，神的荣耀以更完全的方式来到我们中间，就是在耶稣基督的身上。祂是神完全且最终的启示。

> [!important]+ 反思与回应
让我们花时间感谢神奇妙的救恩计划。赞美祂，因为在耶稣里，神亲自临到像你我这样失丧的罪人。求祂开启我们的眼睛，使我们在阅读约翰福音时，更清楚地认识这位耶稣。

### <center>In the Beginning Was the Word</center>

> [!question]+ Review
> 1.⁠ ⁠How does Luke describe Jesus’ innocence and loneliness on the cross?
2.⁠ ⁠What request did the criminal crucified with Jesus make, and how did Jesus respond?
3.⁠ ⁠According to this message, what is the right response for sinners when they face the cross?

📖 **Passage to read**: ==John 01:01-18==

> [!info]- 🎙️Audio: [None]()  

We all introduce ourselves in different ways depending on who we’re talking to. If I were speaking to a group of young men at a basketball camp, I might start by saying, “My name is Jon. I love basketball, and I played for years.” If I were meeting someone who enjoys Homer’s *Odyssey*, I might mention that I studied English literature in college. The gospel writers do something similar. Think of Matthew: he wants to show that Jesus is the promised Messiah and rightful King, so he begins with a genealogy. Mark wants to tell the story of Jesus quickly and clearly, so he jumps right in without any introduction. Luke carefully records the historical details, so he starts with an orderly account. But John writes for everyone. His main concern is that people would believe in Jesus Christ. So instead of starting with family history or background facts, John begins with deep truth about who Jesus really is.

Who is Jesus? John tells us that Jesus is the eternal Word of God. “In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God. He was in the beginning with God” (1:1–2). Jesus has always existed. He is fully God and has always been fully God. He was active in creation—John says, “without him was not any thing made that was made” (1:3). Everything that exists owes its being to him.

Then John gives us an amazing truth. The eternal Word became flesh and lived among us (1:14). The word “lived” can also mean “tabernacled.” In the days of Moses, God’s glory filled the tabernacle, a tent in the wilderness. Now God’s glory has come to us in a far greater way—in the person of Jesus Christ. He is the full and final revelation of God.

> [!important]+ Reflect and Respond
Take time to thank God for this wonderful plan of salvation. Praise him that in Jesus, God himself has drawn near to lost sinners like you and me. Ask him to open your eyes to see Jesus more clearly as you read the Gospel of John.
