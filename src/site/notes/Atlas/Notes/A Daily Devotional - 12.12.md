### <center>亲眼所见与更可靠的见证</center>

> [!info]- 🎙️Audio: [None]()


篮球比赛只剩三秒钟，比分打平，主队持球。就在终场哨响之前，一名球员——离篮筐有些远——投出了最后一球。球进了！观众冲上球场；这是主队一次精彩的、压哨获胜。第二天，一位仍然兴奋的球迷被几个没能到场的朋友问起比赛。当他向他们讲述最后几秒钟的情况时，他们仔细听，并相信了他的描述。为什么？因为他亲眼目睹了比赛！他是目击者！

我们怎么能知道耶稣是神的儿子——这位有一天将以荣耀审判世界的神圣统治者？彼得提醒我们，他亲眼看见了。他看见耶稣在变容山上，在门徒面前被改变、被荣耀。彼得记得那天神父对他儿子所说的话：“这是我的爱子，我所喜悦的”（1:17）。“我在场！”彼得提醒读者。“我们与他同在圣山上”（1:18）。彼得凭亲眼所见的经历知道，耶稣基督就是他所宣称的那位：神的儿子、荣耀的王、全地的神圣审判者。然后出现了惊喜。

彼得说，有一样东西比他个人亲身经历更可靠，可以证明耶稣是神的儿子——无限大能的王、全地的统治者和审判者。那是什么呢？就是圣经的见证。比目击经历更可靠，比彼得、雅各、约翰听到天上神说话更确定，神的话语是最可靠的凭据，证明耶稣是全能的统治者和审判者！彼得写道：“我们有那先知的话，更确实，你们若留心，可作信服”（1:19）。神的话——在这里指旧约圣经——验证了耶稣是谁。这比那些曾亲眼看见他的人更可靠！

> [!important]+ 反思与回应
向神祷告，反思你对他话语的态度。衡量自己与彼得的态度：彼得比起自己的亲身经历，更信靠神话语的见证！求神帮助你相信他的话，并信靠其见证：耶稣基督就是他所宣称的那位——降生为肉身的神之子，将来要以荣耀之王和全地审判者的身份再来。

### <center>Eyewitness and a Better Witness</center>

📖 **Passage to read**: ==2 Peter 1.16-21==

> [!info]- 🎙️Audio: [None]()  

The basketball game was tied with just three seconds remaining on the clock, and the home team had the ball. Just before the final buzzer sounded, one of the players—fading away from the basket—threw a final shot. _Swish!_ The fans rushed onto the court; it was a fantastic, buzzer-beating win for the hometown team. The next day, a still-elated fan was asked about the game by several of his friends who had not been able to attend. As he recounted the final seconds to them, they listened and trusted his description. Why? Because he had been there. He was an eyewitness!

How can we know that Jesus is the Son of God—the divine ruler who will one day judge the earth in glory? Peter reminds us that he was there. He saw Jesus on the Mount of Transfiguration, changed before the eyes of his disciples and glorified in their presence. Peter remembers the words that God the Father spoke on that day about his Son: “This is my beloved Son, with whom I am well pleased” (1:17). “I was there!” Peter reminds his readers. “We were with him on the holy mountain” (1:18). Peter knows from firsthand, eyewitness experience that Jesus Christ was who he claimed to be: God’s Son, the glorious King, the divine Judge of the entire earth. Then comes the surprise.

Peter says something is more sure than even his own personal experience that confirms that Jesus is God’s Son—the infinitely powerful King, Ruler, and Judge of all the earth. What could it be? It is the witness of Scripture. More sure than eyewitness experience, more certain than Peter, James, and John’s hearing God’s voice speaking from heaven, _God’s word_ is the surest indication that Jesus is the almighty ruler and Judge! Peter writes, “We have the prophetic word more fully confirmed, to which you will do well to pay attention” (1:19). God’s word—the Old Testament Scripture, in this instance—verifies who Jesus is. That is a better witness than even people who saw him face-to-face!

> [!important]+ Reflect and Respond
_Talk to God about your attitude toward his word. Measure it against Peter’s attitude: Peter trusted the witness of God’s word more than his own personal experience! Ask God to help you believe his word and trust its witness that Jesus Christ is who he claimed to be—the Son of God, come in the flesh, who will one day return as the glorious King and Judge of all the earth._
