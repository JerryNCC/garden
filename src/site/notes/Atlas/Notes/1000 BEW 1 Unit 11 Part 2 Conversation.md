#### English Conversation:

**Mia**: Hey, Jack! Have you seen the **new** **shop** that just opened near the park?  
**Jack**: Not yet. Is it the one with those **little** decorations hanging at the entrance?

**Mia**: Yes, that’s the one! They **use** a really creative design to attract people. I saw a sign that said they’d **show** their latest products tomorrow.  
**Jack**: Sounds interesting! Do you want to check it out? I have **half** an hour free this evening.

**Mia**: Sure! But let’s not **wait** too long. It gets crowded quickly.  
**Jack**: Good point. By the way, did you see that bird **fly** through the **air** just now? It swooped so close to the **left** side of your head!

**Mia**: I did! It was so fast. I guess we should keep moving before more birds decide to surprise us.

**米娅**：是的！他们**使用**了很有创意的设计来吸引人。我看到一个牌子上写着，他们明天会**展示**最新的商品。  
**杰克**：听起来很有意思！你想去看看吗？我今晚有**一半**小时空闲。

**米娅**：当然可以！不过别**等**太久，那地方很快就会挤满人。  
**杰克**：有道理。对了，你刚才看到那只鸟在**空气**中**飞**过了吗？它几乎擦过你头的**左边**！

**米娅**：我看到了！它飞得好快。我们还是快走吧，免得更多的鸟给我们带来“惊喜”。
