### <center>比摩西更伟大</center>

> [!info]- 🎙️Audio: [A Daily Devotional - 02.10 - CN]()

在《出埃及记》40章中，我们看到了上帝向摩西和以色列百姓发出的最后指示，关于建造会幕的事。会幕是一个特别的地方，上帝将在其中与祂的百姓同住。会幕内有一个隔开的区域，安放着约柜，象征着上帝的圣洁同在。然而，除了建造会幕之外，上帝还向摩西详细说明了如何使会幕成为圣洁。使某物成为圣洁，意味着将其分别出来，归于上帝。会幕、祭坛，甚至家具都被分别为圣后，上帝又命令摩西分别圣洁那些将要事奉上帝、执行祭祀并引导百姓敬拜的祭司。《出埃及记》40:33说：“摩西完成了这项工作。”在摩西的带领下，百姓完成了上帝交给他们的所有工作，现今会幕已经准备好，迎接上帝的同在。

然而，尽管工作已经完成，《出埃及记》最后几节仍让我们感到一种空虚和未竟之感。是的，上帝的荣耀充满了会幕，百姓也已经准备好敬拜上帝。但在40:35中，发生了一个令人惊讶甚至有些伤感的事情：“摩西不能进会幕，因为云彩停在上面，耶和华的荣耀充满了会幕。”摩西，这位上帝的选民和仆人，因为上帝的荣耀的同在，竟无法进入会幕。尽管摩西是上帝所拣选的，他依然是一个罪人，必须与圣洁的上帝保持距离。出埃及记的这一最后注解让我们渴望更多。上帝与祂百姓的工作并未完成，连摩西这样伟大的领袖也无法进入上帝的圣洁同在。摩西同样需要某物——或者某人——来洁净他的罪。

> [!important]+ 反思与回应
摩西，就像我们每一个人一样，也需要耶稣的救恩进入他的心中。你有没有想过这一点？在《出埃及记》40章中，这位伟大的领袖无法接近上帝的荣耀，而耶稣通过祂的死亡洗净我们的罪，使我们可以与上帝亲近。在耶稣里，终有一天我们将在永恒中与我们的创造主亲密同住。今天，感谢上帝赐予我们这一礼物，并祈求祂继续在你我生命中施行祂改变的工作。

📖 **Passage to read**: ==Exodus 40==

> [!info]- 🎙️Audio: [A Daily Devotional - 02.10 - EN]()  

In Exodus 40, we come to the final instructions God gives to Moses and the people about the building of the tabernacle. The tabernacle was a special place where God would dwell among His people. It contained a separated area that held the ark of the covenant, which symbolized God's holy presence. But beyond just building the tabernacle, God gave Moses detailed instructions on how to consecrate it. To consecrate something means to set it apart as holy for God. After the tabernacle, the altar, and even the furniture were consecrated, Moses was told to consecrate the priests who would serve God, perform sacrifices, and lead the people in worship. Exodus 40:33 says, “Moses finished the work.” The people, led by Moses, completed everything God asked them to do, and now the tabernacle was ready for God’s presence.

However, even though this marks the completion of the work, the last few verses of the book of Exodus leave us with a sense of longing and incompleteness. Yes, the glory of the Lord fills the tabernacle, and the people are prepared to worship. But in Exodus 40:35, something surprising—and a little sad—happens: “Moses was not able to enter the tent of meeting because the cloud settled on it, and the glory of the LORD filled the tabernacle.” Moses, the leader and chosen servant of God, is unable to enter the tabernacle because of the presence of God’s glory. Moses, despite being chosen by God, is still a sinner and must keep his distance from the glory of a holy God. This final detail in Exodus leaves us yearning for more. God’s work with His people is not finished, and even Moses, the leader, cannot be in God’s holy presence. Moses, too, needs someone—or something—to cleanse him from his sins.

> [!important]+ Reflect and Respond
Moses, just like all of us, needed the saving work of Jesus in his heart. Have you thought about that? The great leader of God’s people could not come near to God’s glory in Exodus 40, but Jesus, through His death, washes away our sins and makes this closeness with God possible. In Jesus, one day we will live eternally, close to our Creator. Thank God for this gift today, and ask Him to continue His transforming work in your life.
