### <center>悖逆、悔改与复兴</center>

> [!info]- 🎙️Audio: [A Daily Devotional - 06.26 - CN]()

过去一百年，是人类历史中最充满苦难的时期之一。我们亲眼目睹战争、天灾、瘟疫、逼迫、种族灭绝与腐败政权席卷全球，无数百姓饱受煎熬。在这一切之中，上帝在哪里？祂在做什么？《约伯记》虽不提供对恶的简单解答，却赐下更宝贵的东西——它向我们显明上帝的本性，提醒我们：在万事之中，神为祂自己的荣耀行事，也为祂百姓永远的益处成就一切。

正如在约伯记第40章中所见，上帝从未向约伯完整解释他受苦的缘由。我们从经文所知，约伯至终也未曾得知，原来这一切苦难始于撒但向上帝提出的挑战。上帝没有赐下长篇的解释，而是以约伯的悔改作为全书的结束。约伯对神说：“我从前风闻有你，现在亲眼看见你。因此我厌恶自己，在尘土和炉灰中懊悔。”（约伯记42:5–6）约伯真正需要的，不是答案，而是对神更深的降服与信靠。

但神并未止步于此。祂转向约伯的三位朋友，对他们发出严厉的责备，因为“他们议论我，不如我仆人约伯说的是。”（约伯记42:7）令人惊讶的是，最终为这些错误指控他的朋友献祭祷告的，竟是约伯自己。虽然约伯也有需要悔改之处，但那几位“劝慰者”的悖逆更为深重。他们犯的错是把神限制在人的框架里，固执地将苦难与罪恶画上等号，却全然错解了神的作为。

然而，这还不是结局。神亲自复兴了约伯的一切——不只恢复，更是加倍赐福。他的家人归回，他的产业比从前更加丰盛。这位曾经一无所有、遍体鳞伤的人，如今满得神的恩惠与荣耀。

整本约伯记，是关于上帝的书。它教导我们：神是良善的，祂满有智慧，也永远为祂子民的益处行事。那么我们该如何回应？不是一心想要解释所有奥秘，也不是执着要弄清楚每一处苦难的含义，而是要记念神是谁，信靠祂，纵然不明白祂的道路。

> [!important]+ 反思与回应
作为耶稣基督的跟随者，我们蒙召是要安息在神的良善中。今日，让我们向神祷告，求祂帮助我们真心信靠祂。无论环境如何，愿我们紧记祂的属性，紧紧抓住祂的慈爱与主权，哪怕人生充满困惑不解。

📖 **Passage to read**: ==Job 42==

> [!info]- 🎙️Audio: [A Daily Devotional - 06.26 - EN]()  


The last hundred years have been full of pain. We've seen wars, disasters, persecution, disease, and broken governments. People everywhere have suffered. So where is God in all of this? What is he doing? The book of Job doesn’t give easy answers, but it gives something better: it shows us who God is. It reminds us that, in everything, God is working for his glory and for the eternal good of his people.

Just like in Job 40, God never gives Job a full explanation. As far as we can tell, Job never finds out that his suffering came from a challenge Satan made to God. There’s no long speech from God explaining every detail. Instead, the book ends with Job repenting. He says to God, “I had heard of you by the hearing of the ear, but now my eye sees you; therefore I despise myself, and repent in dust and ashes” (Job 42:5–6). What Job really needed wasn’t an answer—it was a deeper surrender to the God he trusted.

But God doesn’t stop there. He speaks to Job’s friends and rebukes them. They had said wrong things about God, while Job had spoken rightly. In a surprising turn, Job is the one who prays and offers sacrifices for his friends—the same men who had falsely accused him. While Job had things to confess, they had even more. They had made the mistake of thinking they had God all figured out. They tried to force a link between suffering and sin, and they were wrong.

And even after that, God still isn’t done. He restores Job’s life—fully and richly. Job’s family comes back to him. His wealth grows even greater than before. The same man who lost everything is blessed beyond measure.

This story is about God. It reminds us that he is good, that he is wise, and that he wants what is best for his people—forever. So what should we do? Not try to solve every mystery or explain every hardship. Instead, we should remember who God is. We should trust him, even when we don’t understand.

> [!important]+ Reflect and Respond
As followers of Jesus, our calling is to rest in God’s goodness. Let’s pray today that we really do that. Let’s ask him to help us remember his character and hold tightly to his goodness and power, even when life doesn’t make sense.
