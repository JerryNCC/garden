### <center>罪恶的、不那么隐秘的握手</center>

> [!info]- 🎙️Audio: [A Daily Devotional - 07.26 - CN]()


《以赛亚书》第二章为我们展开一幅荣耀的图景。有一天，正如先知所说，“耶和华殿的山必坚定，超乎诸山，高举过于万岭；万民都要流归这山。”（以赛亚书 2:2）这是多么奇妙的画面：普天下的人将一同前来敬拜独一真神。以赛亚似乎在严厉的宣告之间停下来说：“你们看，这就是神为万民所预备的将来！”

然而，那日尚未来到。当下仍有一道巨大的障碍横亘在神的救赎计划之前，那就是——祂子民不断重复的罪。神的百姓并不与祂同心，无法体会这荣耀的异象。他们不仅未能吸引列国来敬拜真神，反倒主动去效法列国的偶像与罪恶。以赛亚指出：“他们充满了东方的风俗，是占卜的像非利士人一样，并与外邦人击掌。”（2:6）这“击掌”并非代表传福音或见证真理，而是妥协的象征。他们将属神的敬拜，出卖给了那些不敬畏神之人的生活方式。

神为祂的子民预备了荣耀而喜乐的计划。但罪不断拦阻这美好成就。因而我们开始明白：在犹大的罪恶现状与那将来神同在的荣耀之间，必须有一件决定性的事情发生——某个能够彻底除去罪的行动。神必照祂的旨意成就这一切，即使祂的百姓一再悖逆，祂仍不撇弃。

到了本章末尾，以赛亚宣告那日将来到：“惟独耶和华被尊崇。”（2:11）神要除灭骄傲、拆毁偶像、洁净人心。祂要为自己成就一群圣洁的子民，全心敬拜祂。

好消息在于：神的审判并非最终落在祂百姓身上，而是落在替代他们的人身上。那人就是祂的独生子。耶稣担当了我们的罪与审判，使我们可以与神永远同住。

为此向神献上感谢！是祂亲自施行拯救，这一切都不是出于我们，乃是出于祂。

### <center>A Sinful, Not-So-Secret Handshake</center>

> [!question]+ Review
> 1. Why does Isaiah describe Israel as “rebellious children”? What does this say about God’s relationship with his people?
> 2. Why is God not pleased with the people’s sacrifices? What kind of worship is He truly looking for?
> 3. In calling the faithful city a “whore,” what can we learn about God’s love and His holiness in His relationship with His people?

📖 **Passage to read**: ==Isaiah 02==

> [!info]- 🎙️Audio: [A Daily Devotional - 07.26 - EN]()  

Isaiah 2 gives us a glimpse of something beautiful. One day, Isaiah says, God’s mountain—his house—will be lifted high, above all other places. “All the nations shall flow to it” (2:2). That’s an amazing picture: people from every part of the earth coming together to worship the true God. Isaiah seems to pause in the middle of his warnings and says, “Look at what God has planned!”

But we’re not there yet. That day is still coming. Right now, there’s a big problem: sin. God’s people don’t share his vision. Instead of leading the nations to worship God, they’ve gone to the nations and joined in their sin. Isaiah says, “They are full of things from the east… and they strike hands with the children of foreigners” (2:6). That handshake isn’t about mission. It’s about compromise. God’s people are letting the sin of others shape their own lives.

God has a plan for his people—a plan full of glory and joy. But sin keeps getting in the way. That means something has to happen. Something has to deal with sin once and for all. God is going to make his plan come true, even though his people keep turning away from him.

At the end of the chapter, Isaiah says the day is coming when “the Lord alone will be exalted.” God will crush pride, remove idols, and clean out sin. He will make a people for himself who will worship him with whole hearts.

But here’s the good news. God’s judgment won’t fall on his people—it will fall on someone else in their place. That someone is his Son. Jesus took our judgment so that we can live with God forever.

> [!important]+ Reflect and Respond
Thank God for that! He’s the one who saves us. It’s not our work—it’s his.
