### <center>耶稣——新的、更美的亚当</center>

> [!info]- 🎙️Audio: [None]()


圣经并不是一堆彼此无关的古老故事，而是一条贯穿始终的伟大叙事——讲述上帝如何藉着祂的儿子耶稣基督，拯救迷失的罪人。我们时常会忘记这一点。读《利未记》的律法、《士师记》的战事，或耶稣的比喻时，我们很容易忽略那条贯穿全书的主线。但《罗马书》第五章再次提醒我们：整本圣经其实在讲同一个故事——从《创世记》开始，直到永恒。

保罗在这里谈论的是上帝所赐的救恩——那藉着耶稣基督在十字架上所成就的救赎。忽然，他提起一个久远的名字——亚当，那个上帝最初所造的人。为什么保罗在谈论救恩时，会提起亚当呢？

保罗要我们看见一个强烈的对比：在人类历史中，有两位伟大的代表。第一位是亚当。在伊甸园中，亚当和夏娃违背了上帝的命令。因着他们的罪，死亡进入了世界，并蔓延给众人。保罗说：“死亡作了王”（罗5:12,14）。从那时起，每一个人都生在亚当的统治之下——在罪中、在死中，也在定罪之下。我们都生在一个破碎的世界里，承受着亚当的堕落。

但福音带来了好消息：上帝为我们预备了另一位代表。正如亚当使众人落入死亡，耶稣却带来了生命。因着祂的顺服与在十字架上的救赎工作，祂成为一个新族类的元首。祂也像亚当一样代表人类，却不是代表罪与死，而是代表公义与生命。

保罗借此帮助我们看见：整本圣经是何等合一。耶稣并不是临时出现的救主，祂是那位新的、更完美的亚当，是为信靠祂的人而立的代表与救赎主。

> [!important]+ 反思与回应
因此，请思想，你现在属于哪一位代表？若仍在亚当里，你仍在罪中、仍在死亡之下。但若你转向基督，凭信心与悔改归向祂，你就属那新的亚当——耶稣基督。在祂里面，有赦免、有生命、有永恒的盼望。感谢上帝，祂差遣祂的儿子，打破罪与死的权势，引领我们进入祂丰盛的生命，直到永远。

### <center>Jesus, the New and Better Adam</center>

> [!question]+ Review

📖 **Passage to read**: ==Roman 5.12-21==

> [!info]- 🎙️Audio: [None]()  

The Bible is not just a pile of old stories placed side by side. It is one great story—the story of how God saves lost sinners through His Son, Jesus Christ. Sometimes we forget that. As we read the laws in Leviticus, the battles in Judges, or even the parables Jesus told, it’s easy to miss the thread that ties it all together. But passages like Romans 5 remind us again: the whole Bible tells one story, beginning in Genesis and stretching into eternity.

Paul here is talking about the salvation that God gives through Jesus Christ—salvation that comes by His death on the cross. Then suddenly, Paul brings up a name from long ago—Adam, the first man. Why would he mention Adam right here, in the middle of a discussion about salvation?

Paul wants us to see a contrast. He reminds us that there have been two great representatives of the human race. The first was Adam. In the garden, Adam and Eve disobeyed God. Because of that sin, death entered the world and spread to everyone. Paul even says that “death reigned” after the fall (Rom. 5:12, 14). From then on, every person was born under Adam’s rule—under sin, under death, and under judgment. We are all born into a broken world and share in Adam’s fall.

But the good news of the gospel is this: God has given us another representative. Just as Adam brought death, Jesus brings life. Through His obedience and His work on the cross, He became the new head of a new people. Like Adam, He stands for us—but not in sin and death. He stands for us in righteousness and life.

> [!important]+ Reflect and Respond
Paul helps us see that the whole Bible fits together. Jesus is not a sudden or random answer to our problems. He is the new Adam—the better, perfect representative for all who trust in Him.
