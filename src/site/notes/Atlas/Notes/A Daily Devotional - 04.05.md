### <center>神不会被利用</center>

> [!info]- 🎙️Audio: [A Daily Devotional - 04.05 - CN]()

在《撒母耳记》里，我们不必等待太久，就能看到撒母耳的预言是否会成真。在撒母耳被呼召之后，接着我们便进入了《撒母耳记》四章的战斗场景。以色列人与他们的宿敌非利士人展开了对抗。第一场战斗对以色列人来说并不顺利。百姓开始疑惑，为什么神允许邪恶的非利士人打败他们。可是他们没有意识到，这一切正是根据神通过撒母耳所发出的预言——对以利两个邪恶儿子的审判。

面对败北，祭司和百姓决定将约柜抬出来，带到战场前，以期借此获得胜利。你可能知道，约柜象征着神与祂子民同在，它被安放在圣所中。然而，约柜仅仅是一个象征。通过将约柜带到战场，百姓实际上把它当作了一个幸运符，期望它能带来他们渴望的胜利。可他们并没有顺服神，生活在敬拜中，而是试图利用神来实现自己的目的。

将约柜抬到战场并没有改变神真实的旨意——那位站在约柜背后的神并不会被人操控。他已经宣告了对以利两个儿子罪行的审判。最终，这一章以悲剧告终，祭司以利听到儿子死讯和约柜被非利士人俘虏的消息后，震惊而死。

以色列人需要明白，神不住在约柜里。祂不会被任何象征或仪式所限制，祂也不会被百姓拿出来作为私利的工具。神是圣洁的、全能的、公正的，祂要求祂的子民顺服、悔改、并过圣洁的生活。当百姓拒绝悔改他们的罪恶和不顺服时，无论多么神圣的仪式都无法转移神公义的怒气。

> [!important]+ 反思与回应
你是否曾经认为某些宗教仪式——祷告、参加教会、灵修——可以帮助你获得神的喜悦？我们必须明白：神不会被利用。祂不希望我们把祂当作实现自己目的的工具。相反，祂呼召我们悔改自己的罪，转向祂，追随祂对我们生命的美好计划。今天，你要祈祷，不让自己试图利用神，而是谦卑地将自己完全交托给祂，顺服祂在基督里的旨意。

### <center>God Will Not Be Used</center>

> [!question]+ Review
> 1. ⁠Why is the behavior of Eli’s sons, Hophni and Phinehas, a serious violation of God’s instructions? How did their actions affect the people’s worship?
> 2. In the event where the Israelites brought the ark to battle, how did they view the ark? How did this attitude affect their relationship with God?
> 3. ⁠What lesson can we learn from the contrast between the corrupt priests and the faithful Samuel in this passage? How can we avoid similar corruption in spiritual leadership today?

📖 **Passage to read**: ==1 Samuel 04==

> [!info]- 🎙️Audio: [A Daily Devotional - 04.05 - EN]()  


In 1 Samuel, we don't have to wait long to see whether Samuel's prophecy will come true. Right after Samuel's calling, we are immediately thrown into a battle in 1 Samuel 4. The Israelites face off against their long-time enemies, the Philistines. The first battle doesn't go well for Israel. The people wonder why God has allowed the wicked Philistines to defeat them. What they don’t realize is that all of this is happening because of God's word through Samuel—a word of judgment on the wicked sons of Eli.

In response to their defeat, the priests and people decide to bring out the ark of the covenant, hoping it will lead them to victory in battle. The ark, you may know, represented God's presence with His people, and it was kept in the holy place of worship. But the ark was simply a symbol. By bringing it to the battlefield, the people had reduced the ark to a good luck charm, hoping it would give them the victory they wanted. Instead of submitting to God and living in worship, they were trying to use Him for their own purposes.

Marching out the ark didn't change the fact that the true God, who stood behind it, was not going to be manipulated. He had already declared His judgment on the wickedness of Eli's sons. The chapter ends in tragedy as Eli dies, shocked by the news of his sons’ death and the Philistines capturing the ark.

The Israelites needed to understand that God doesn't live in the ark. He cannot be confined by any symbol or ritual. He will not be pulled out for the people’s personal gain. God is holy, mighty, and just, and He demands obedience, repentance, and holiness from His people. No ritual, no matter how sacred it seems, can turn away God’s righteous anger when His people refuse to repent for their sin and disobedience.

> [!important]+ Reflect and Respond
Do you ever find yourself thinking that certain religious rituals—prayers, church attendance, devotions—might help you get in good with God? It’s important to realize: God will not be used. He doesn’t want to be treated like a tool to achieve your own purposes. Instead, He calls us to repent of our sins, turn to Him, and follow His good plans for our lives. Pray today that you would not try to use God, but that you would humbly submit yourself to His will and live obediently to His purposes in Christ.
