### <center>神说</center>

想象一下：你的家中养着一只体格健壮、漂亮的大型英国拳师犬。它体重七十五磅，肌肉发达，可以跳跃几英尺高，奔跑速度无人能及。每当有新客人到访，这只狗总是异常兴奋，跳到他们身上，用爪子抓他们的衣服。有时候，它太想玩耍了，甚至会试图咬客人的脚踝或鞋带。虽然它懂得坐下的命令，但一旦兴奋起来，你的言语对它毫无作用。在这个家中，至少对这只狗来说，言语显得无能为力。

现在，思考一下这个世界的创造过程。《创世记》开篇写道：“起初，地是空虚混沌，渊面黑暗；神的灵运行在水面上”（创1:1-2）。接着，一件奇妙的事情发生了：“神说”（创1:3）。你是否曾停下来深思过这句话的意义？当神创造宇宙时，祂并未动用任何体力，也未用双手塑造万物。祂只是说话。这位我们所敬拜、认识、爱戴的神，仅用言语便创造了整个宇宙。

在整个创造过程中，这句“神说”不断重复，而接着是另一句：“神看着是好的。”神注视祂所创造的一切，心中满怀喜悦。一切都是美好的。

然而，故事在这里发生了转折。神在三位一体的内在关系中进行了一次简短的“对话”——这位独一的神，同时是父、子、圣灵——祂说：“我们要照着我们的形象，按着我们的样式造人”（创1:26）。这一刻显得格外特别。人类的创造方式不同于其他受造之物，他们的存在也有着独特的目的。唯有人类承载着这位永恒、荣耀、三一神的形象。神将治理这地的权柄赐给人类，祝福他们，并命令他们繁衍生息。

这便是圣经故事的开端：神用言语创造了世界，肯定了祂所造的一切美好，并将人类分别为圣，赋予他们独特的使命。在神眼中，这部分的创造不仅是好的，更是“甚好”（创1:31）。

> [!important]+ 反思与回应
> 花些时间来敬拜这位创造万物的神，也包括创造你的神。思想祂话语的大能，记住祂为你预备的独特使命。在祷告中，把你今天的忧虑和喜乐一同带到祂面前吧。

### <center>And God Said</center>

Picture this: your family has a big, strong, and beautiful English boxer. Weighing seventy-five pounds, this dog is pure muscle. He can leap several feet in the air and outrun anyone in the house. Whenever new people visit, the dog gets so excited that he jumps all over them, pawing at their clothes. Sometimes, he’s so eager to play that he tries to nip at ankles or tug at shoelaces. Sure, he knows how to sit, but when he’s overly excited, your words mean nothing to him. In your house, at least when it comes to this dog, words lack power.

Now, think about the creation of the world. Genesis begins with these words: “In the beginning, the earth was without form and void, and darkness was over the face of the deep. And the Spirit of God was hovering over the face of the waters” (Gen. 1:1–2). Then, something astonishing happens: “And God said” (Gen. 1:3). Have you ever paused to consider the significance of this? When God created the universe, He didn’t exert physical effort. He didn’t fashion things with His hands. He spoke. The God we worship, the God who calls us to know and love Him, spoke—and an entire universe came into being.

Throughout the creation account, this refrain, _“And God said,”_ repeats, followed by another: _“And God saw that it was good.”_ God looked at His creation and found delight in it. Everything He made was good.

But then, the narrative shifts. God, in a brief conversation within the Trinity—the one God who exists as Father, Son, and Holy Spirit—says, _“Let us make man in our image, after our likeness”_ (Gen. 1:26). This moment is unique. Human beings are created differently from the rest of creation and for a distinct purpose. Only humans bear the image of the eternal, glorious triune God. To them, God grants dominion over the earth, blesses them, and commands them to multiply.

This is how the story of the Bible begins: with God speaking the world into existence, affirming the goodness of everything He created, and setting human beings apart for a special role. To God, this part of creation wasn’t just good; it was _very good_ (Gen. 1:31).

> [!important]+ Reflect and Respond
> Take time to worship God, the Creator of all things, including you. Reflect on the power of His Word. Remember that He made you for a unique purpose. And as you pray, bring before Him both the challenges and the joys of your day.
