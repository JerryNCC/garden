### <center>火湖与生命册</center>

> [!info]- 🎙️Audio: [None]()

《启示录》第20章描述了人类历史上最重要的三件事。朋友，我们正走到这个故事的结局。许多人认为这些事情尚未发生——但它们终将发生。神因爱我们，将未来的事告诉我们！那么，这些事件是什么呢？

首先，约翰告诉我们，撒但必被捆绑，基督必与他的子民在地上作王，时间为一千年。根据你所属于的教会和神学传统，你可能相信这是一个象征性的时期——实际上正在发生——在此期间撒但被捆绑，福音得以在世上传播。或者你可能相信，这指的是将来的某个时期，那时基督与他的子民的统治将更加公开、强有力且明显。不论哪种情况，这都是暂时的局面，先于撒但和全人类的最终审判。

其次，我们发现撒但及其一切势力将被彻底击败并永远受罚。在撒但被捆绑的时期之后，这位神子民的大敌将再次出现，“迷惑列国”并“招聚他们与耶稣及其子民争战”（20:8）。然而，这场争战几乎没有悬念！火必从天降下，罪恶与死亡的军队将最终被毁灭，撒但被永远投入火湖。这是我们从撒但所听到的最后消息！

最后，这段经文告诉我们，每一个曾经活过的人都将接受最终审判。在撒但被击败并受罚之后，生命册将被展开。约翰描述有一大群人“站在宝座前”接受审判（20:12）。那些名字记在生命册上的人将得救，永远活在耶稣君王的面前；那些名字不在册上的人，将被投入与撒但同样的地方——火湖。

> [!important]+ 反思与回应 
我们终有一天将站在耶稣的宝座前接受审判。你凭什么盼望能在审判中得以存活？你凭什么期望能逃脱撒但与所有追随他之人所受惩罚的火湖？求神帮助你坚定信靠唯有基督的信心。唯有耶稣——唯有耶稣——的死与复活，能确保我们在生命册上的名分。今天就信靠他吧！

📖 **Passage to read**: ==Revelation 20==

> [!info]- 🎙️Audio: [None]()  

Revelation 20 describes three of the most important events that will ever occur in all human history. Friend, we are coming to the end of this story. Many people believe that these things haven’t happened yet—but they will. God, because he loves us, has told us what is coming! So, what are these events?

First, John tells us that Satan will be bound, and Christ will reign with his people on earth for a period of one thousand years. Depending on your church and theological tradition, you may believe that this is a symbolic period of time—actually taking place now—during which Satan is bound and the gospel is able to grow in the world. Or you may believe that this speaks of a future period of time when the reign of Christ and his people will be much more open, forceful, and obvious. Either way, this is a _temporary_ situation, which comes _before_ the final judgment of Satan and of all people.

Second, we find that Satan and all his forces will be defeated and punished forever. After the period of Satan’s binding, the great enemy of God’s people will emerge one more time to “deceive the nations” and “gather them for battle” against Jesus and his people (20:8). It won’t be much of a contest, though! Fire will come down from heaven and this army of sin and death will be finally destroyed, with Satan cast into the lake of fire forever. This is the last we hear from Satan!

Finally, this passage tells us that there will be a final judgment for every human being who has ever lived. After Satan is defeated and punished, the books will be thrown open. John describes a great multitude of people “standing before the throne” to be judged (20:12). Those whose names are found in the book of life will be saved, to live forever in the presence of Jesus the King. Those whose names are not there are thrown into the same place as Satan—the lake of fire.

> [!important]+ Reflect and Respond
_We will stand before the throne of Jesus someday to be judged. On what grounds do you hope to survive that judgment? On what basis do you expect to escape the lake of fire, where Satan and all who follow him will be punished? Ask God to help you stand firm on faith in Christ alone. It is Jesus—only Jesus—whose death and resurrection can secure our place in the book of life. Trust him today!_
