### <center>从前的时候</center>

> [!info]- 🎙️Audio: [None]()

我们听过多少故事是这样开始的：“从前的时候……”？这是一个带我们回到起初的句子——往往是回到一段美好的开始。耶利米书第二章就是这样开始的。先知耶利米提醒以色列人从前的日子。耶和华说：“你幼年的恩爱、婚姻的时候你怎样爱我，怎样在旷野、在未曾种植之地跟随我，我都记得。”（耶2:2）这是一幅温柔的画面。那时的以色列还年轻，刚刚从埃及被救出来，是属神的圣民，愿意跟随祂同行。

但这美好的光景没有持续下去。神的百姓离弃了祂，一次又一次地转向虚无。耶利米毫不掩饰地揭露他们的罪。他用一些极为强烈的比喻来形容他们悖逆的样子：

* 他们将自己的荣耀换为虚无之物。
* 他们离弃活水的泉源，为自己凿出不能存水的破裂池子。
* 他们像野葡萄树，结不出好果子。
* 他们被罪污秽得极深，再多的香皂也洗不干净。
* 他们如发情的驴或骆驼，为了情欲四处奔跑。

神的百姓不是迷路了，而是有意识地远离祂，去追逐那些不是神的东西。耶利米毫不保留地说，他们就像一群愚昧、受情欲驱使的牲畜，追随虚假的神明。而令人心碎的是，当他们遇到患难时，却转而向耶和华呼求。神的回应令人震撼——祂说，让你们所拣选的假神去救你们吧。你们一次又一次地弃绝我，现在为何又来呼求我呢？

这是一个严厉的章节，但它必须如此。耶利米毫无保留地揭示了人离弃真神所带来的结局。这个世界的替代品看似吸引，却都不能赐生命，不能拯救，不能叫人心满意足。尽管如此，我们每一个人都容易陷入这样的试探。

> [!important]+ 反思与回应
我们需要这样的提醒。我们需要清楚看见罪的真貌，也需要祈求神保守我们的心，单单倚靠祂，敬拜祂，爱慕祂。因为唯有在祂那里，我们才真正得着生命，找到归属。

### <center>Once upon a Time</center>

> [!question]+ Review
> 1. ⁠Why was Jeremiah hesitant to respond to God's call at first? How did God address his concern?

📖 **Passage to read**: ==Jeremiah 02==

> [!info]- 🎙️Audio: [None]()  

How many stories have we heard that begin with “Once upon a time…”? It’s a phrase that takes us back to the beginning of something—usually something good. That’s how Jeremiah starts in chapter 2. He reminds Israel of how things used to be. God says, “I remember the devotion of your youth, your love as a bride, how you followed me in the wilderness” (2:2). It’s a tender picture. Israel was young then, newly rescued from Egypt, set apart, walking with God.

But that didn’t last. The people walked away. Again and again, they turned from God to worthless things. Jeremiah doesn’t sugarcoat this. He gives strong images to show what their sin looks like:

They gave up their glory for what is empty and useless.

They turned from the fountain of living water and dug leaky wells.

They became like wild vines that bear no fruit.

They are so stained with sin that no amount of soap can clean them.

They act like animals chasing after their desires—like donkeys or camels in heat.

God’s people weren’t just wandering—they were running after everything except God. Jeremiah speaks plainly: they were like foolish animals driven by lust, chasing false gods. And the sad thing is, when they got into trouble, they cried out to God. But God’s answer is piercing. He tells them: go ask your fake gods for help. Why call on me now, after all your chasing?

It’s a hard chapter. But it needs to be. Jeremiah shows us clearly what happens when we turn from God. The world offers substitutes, but none of them give life. They don’t save. They don’t satisfy. Still, we’re all tempted to look elsewhere.

> [!important]+ Reflect and Respond
We need to hear this. We need to see what sin really looks like. And we need to ask God to keep us close—devoted to him, trusting in him, worshiping him alone. That’s where we belong. That’s where life is.
