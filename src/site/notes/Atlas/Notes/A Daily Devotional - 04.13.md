### <center>圣经中的友谊</center>

> [!info]- 🎙️Audio: [A Daily Devotional - 04.13 - CN]()

如果有人有理由感到嫉妒，那一定是扫罗王的儿子约拿单！作为王位的继承人，约拿单亲眼目睹了父亲的失败和大卫的崛起——大卫将来会代替他，成为以色列的王。许多人可能会像约拿单一样对这种挑战自己继承权的局面做出不同的反应。我们或许会对大卫心生愤怒，嫉妒神的恩宠降临在他身上，甚至可能希望他的失败。然而，约拿单却选择鼓励、支持并捍卫大卫。

约拿单与大卫的友谊教会我们什么是真正的圣经友谊？首先，他无私地爱大卫。《撒母耳记》作者使用了非常强烈的语言来描述约拿单对大卫的承诺，特别是他两次提到约拿单“爱大卫，像爱自己的生命” （18:1, 3）。约拿单通过将自己的盔甲、长袍和剑——这些象征着他作为国王之子的身份的物品——送给大卫，来表达他对大卫的爱。这种爱没有任何自私的动机。第二，约拿单爱大卫，因为他支持神对大卫的生命和神子民的计划。

约拿单意识到他的父亲扫罗没有一颗追求神心意的心，而大卫却有。约拿单认识并顺服神的旨意，接受了王位从扫罗家族转移到大卫家族的安排。通过与大卫建立友谊并支持他，约拿单顺服了神对国家的旨意。

以色列民众被大卫吸引，因为他是一位为神而战，为百姓而战的年轻勇士。他们甚至为他写了一首歌：“扫罗杀千千，大卫杀万万” （18:7）。扫罗当然注意到了这一点，而他的反应显然不同于忠诚的儿子约拿单。他被嫉妒充满，在一阵愤怒中，甚至试图用长矛杀死大卫。但大卫得到了神的祝福，并被神选择将来成为以色列的王。扫罗却被嫉妒、痛苦和对大卫的恐惧所困扰，而大卫则得到了神的认同和百姓的青睐。在约拿单接受神对大卫的计划时，扫罗却继续堕入愤怒、仇恨和罪恶的深渊。

今天，祈祷神帮助你成为一个无私的朋友，鼓励朋友们成就神在他们生命中的工作。求神使耶稣这位真正的王成为你所有友谊的核心动力。

### <center>Biblical Friendship</center>

> [!question]+ Review
> 1. Why do we often mistakenly identify ourselves as David in the story of David and Goliath, overlooking the fact that we are more like the fearful Israelites? How might this misunderstanding affect our interpretation of the passage?
> 2. How did David fight Goliath by trusting in God and ultimately gaining victory? What does this trust teach us when we face the "giants" in our own lives?
> 3. ⁠ ⁠Why is Jesus the true champion in this story? How should we respond to the sacrifice Jesus made for us and participate in His mission?

📖 **Passage to read**: ==1 Samuel 18:01-16==

> [!info]- 🎙️Audio: [A Daily Devotional - 04.13 - EN]()  

If anyone had the right to feel envious, it was Jonathan, the son of King Saul. As the heir to the throne, Jonathan had to witness his father’s failures and the rise of David, the man who would one day take the throne instead of him. Many of us might have reacted very differently than Jonathan. We could have been angry at David, resented God’s favor on him, and maybe even wished for his downfall. But instead, Jonathan encourages, supports, and defends David.

What does Jonathan’s friendship with David teach us about true biblical friendship? First, he loves David sacrificially. The author of 1 Samuel uses strong language to describe Jonathan’s love for David, repeating twice that Jonathan loved him “as his own soul” (18:1, 3). Jonathan shows this love by giving David his armor, his robe, and his sword—symbols of his royal status as the king’s son. Jonathan’s love for David is not motivated by any selfish interests. Second, Jonathan loves David because he supports God’s plan for his life and for His people.
Jonathan realizes that his father, Saul, does not have a heart after God’s own heart, but David does. Jonathan understands and accepts God’s will in the transition of kingship from Saul to David. By befriending and supporting David, Jonathan is submitting to God’s will for the nation.

The people of Israel are drawn to David, a young warrior who serves God and fights on their behalf. They even compose a song in his honor: “Saul has struck down his thousands, and David his ten thousands” (18:7). Saul, of course, becomes jealous and reacts not like his son Jonathan. He is consumed by envy, and in a rage, attempts to kill David with a spear. But David is blessed by God and chosen to be the future king of Israel. Saul, on the other hand, remains trapped in envy, bitterness, and fear toward David, who has God’s approval and the favor of the people. While Jonathan embraces God’s plan for David, Saul continues his downward spiral of anger, hatred, and sin.

Pray today that God would help you be a friend who loves sacrificially and encourages God’s work in the lives of your friends. Ask God to make Jesus, the true King, the central focus of all your friendships.
