### <center>神不改变的计划</center>

> [!info]- 🎙️Audio: [A Daily Devotional - 02.27 - CN]()


有一种对“疯狂”的定义是，做同样的事情一遍又一遍，却期待不同的结果。如果这是真的，那么巴勒克简直就快要疯狂了！他害怕以色列人，所以他决心让先知巴兰诅咒他们。但事情并没有按他计划的那样发展。

《民数记》中的这个故事几乎是滑稽的。巴勒克越是想让巴兰诅咒以色列人，巴兰反而越是为他们祝福。在巴兰的第一次预言之后，他预言了以色列的兴盛与祝福，巴勒克愤怒了。他说：“你对我做了什么呢？我把你带来是为了诅咒我的敌人，结果你什么也没做，只是为他们祝福。”（23:11）巴兰，尽管不是一个好人，却被上帝的话语所捆绑。他回答说：“耶和华叫我说什么，我岂能不说呢？”（23:12）这一循环不断上演，每次都更荒谬，巴勒克试图用不同的方式让巴兰诅咒以色列。他带他去不同的地方，建造祭坛，甚至让巴兰面对旷野时才发表预言。最后，在巴兰四次预言以色列的祝福之后，巴兰和巴勒克都放弃了，最终在《民数记》24章结束时，他们都回家了。

《民数记》22-24章告诉我们一个重要的真理：上帝对祂子民的计划从未改变。从上帝呼召亚伯兰开始，我们就看到了一个反复出现的模式——上帝意图祝福祂的子民，尽管他们常常抗拒祂的祝福。上帝依然坚定地要祝福他们。尽管《民数记》中描述了上帝子民的背叛与罪孽，但上帝的目的没有改变，祂对他们的态度始终是祝福。巴兰不能诅咒那些上帝没有诅咒的人。

> [!important]+ 反思与回应
如果今天你属于耶稣——如果祂是你的救主和主宰，那么你就在上帝的永久祝福之下。没有什么能改变这一点！虽然撒但可能试图让你感到内疚并控告你，但神的话语提醒我们，在基督里，我们已经完全得到了赦免，因祂为我们的罪在十字架上献出了自己的生命。没有人能诅咒那些上帝通过祂的儿子选择要祝福的人！

📖 **Passage to read**: ==Numbers 23==

> [!info]- 🎙️Audio: [A Daily Devotional - 02.27 - EN]()  


One definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over again and expecting different results. If that’s true, then Balak is on the verge of insanity! He fears the Israelites, so he is determined to have the prophet Balaam curse them. But it doesn't work out the way he plans.

This story in Numbers is almost comical. The more Balak tries to get Balaam to curse Israel, the more Balaam ends up blessing them. After Balaam’s first prophecy, which speaks of Israel’s great success and blessing, Balak is furious. He says, “What have you done to me? I brought you to curse my enemies, and you’ve done nothing but bless them” (23:11). Balaam, though not a good man, is stuck with God’s message. He replies, “I must speak what the LORD puts in my mouth” (23:12). The cycle continues, each time more absurd, as Balak tries new ways to make Balaam curse Israel. He takes him to different locations, builds altars, and even tries having Balaam face the wilderness when he speaks. In the end, after Balaam gives four prophecies of blessing, both Balaam and Balak give up and go home at the end of Numbers 24.

The story in Numbers 22–24 shows us something important: God’s plan for his people has never changed. From the moment God called Abram, we see a repeating pattern—God intends to bless his people, even though they often resist that blessing. God remains committed to blessing them. Even though Numbers tells of rebellion and sin from God’s people, God’s purpose has not shifted. His stance toward them is always one of blessing. Balaam cannot curse the people whom God has not cursed.

> [!important]+ Reflect and Respond
If you belong to Jesus today, if he is your Savior and Lord, then you are under God’s permanent blessing. Nothing can change that! Satan may try to make you feel guilty and accuse you, but God’s Word reminds us that in Christ, we are completely forgiven, cleansed by His sacrifice on the cross for our sins. No one can curse the ones God has chosen to bless through His Son!
