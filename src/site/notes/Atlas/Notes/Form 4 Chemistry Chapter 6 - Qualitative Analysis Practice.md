### Questions Based on Observation of Tests to Identify Unknown Salts:
6. **Question 6**: You add dilute nitric acid followed by silver nitrate solution to an unknown salt solution, and a white precipitate forms. Identify the anion present in the salt and explain your reasoning. [[Form 4 Chemistry Chapter 6 Qualitative Analysis exercise#Answer 6\|Go to Answer 6]]
7. **Question 7**: A student conducts a test by adding barium chloride solution to an unknown solution, resulting in a white precipitate that does not dissolve in dilute hydrochloric acid. What anion is present, and how do you know? [[Form 4 Chemistry Chapter 6 Qualitative Analysis exercise#Answer 7\|Go to Answer 7]]
8. **Question 8**: When sodium hydroxide solution is added to an unknown salt solution, a green precipitate forms. The precipitate turns brown upon standing. Identify the cation present in the salt and explain the reaction taking place. [[Form 4 Chemistry Chapter 6 Qualitative Analysis exercise#Answer 8\|Go to Answer 8]]
9. **Question 9**: A salt solution is heated with sodium hydroxide solution, releasing a gas that turns damp red litmus paper blue. Identify the cation in the salt and describe the chemical reaction that leads to the observation. [[Form 4 Chemistry Chapter 6 Qualitative Analysis exercise#Answer 9\|Go to Answer 9]]
10. **Question 10**: A confirmatory test for a salt gives a yellow precipitate when lead(II) nitrate is added to the salt solution. Identify the anion present in the salt and provide the chemical equation for the reaction. [[Form 4 Chemistry Chapter 6 Qualitative Analysis exercise#Answer 10\|Go to Answer 10]]
