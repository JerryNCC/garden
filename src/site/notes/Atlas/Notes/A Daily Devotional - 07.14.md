### <center>生与死的抉择</center>

> [!info]- 🎙️Audio: [A Daily Devotional - 07.14 - CN]()

你也许听过这句诗：
“两条路在林中分开，
我走上了人迹罕至的一条，
这使一切大不相同。”
这是选择的力量。《箴言》第九章给我们一幅图画：不是两条道路，而是两位女子——两种声音，两种邀请。一个是智慧的妇人，一个是愚昧的妇人。

智慧的妇人被描绘成一位稳重而坚固的人。她的房屋立在七根柱子之上，桌上摆满丰盛的筵席。她呼喊说：“你们愚蒙人，要舍弃愚蒙，就得存活，并要走上聪明的道”（箴9:6）。她的呼召十分清楚：离开愚昧和罪恶，离开肤浅和自私的生活。她再一次提醒我们《箴言》的中心真理：“敬畏耶和华，是智慧的开端；认识至圣者，便是聪明”（箴9:10）。智慧的妇人象征那专心倚靠上帝、遵行祂话语的生命。她向众人发出邀请，而她的应许是真实的——得着生命。

但愚昧的妇人也在呼喊。她喧嚷、张扬——却极具危险。她一无所知，却说出诱人的话。她说：“偷来的水是甜的，暗吃的饼是好的”（箴9:17）。换句话说，她试图让我们相信，罪是美好而刺激的。但这不过是谎言，她的道路终将导向死亡。她的承诺永远无法带来真正的满足。

这一章让我们看见了一幅鲜明的画面：我们每日所面对的，是一个清晰的选择。这不仅仅是智慧与愚昧之间的选择，更是生命与死亡、上帝之道与撒但之道之间的抉择。智慧的道路，是通往生命之路，是上帝所喜悦的路；而罪的道路，不管看起来多么吸引人，最终只会带来败坏与灭亡。

> [!important]+ 反思与回应
若你已经听见并回应了上帝的呼召，就当感谢祂。因着耶稣基督，祂赐下智慧与救恩。如今就祷告，求神赐你有一颗像《箴言》所描绘的明亮眼睛，看清世上的虚妄与真理。求祂使你也能带领他人归向耶稣——那惟一真正的生命、智慧与盼望的源头。

### <center>A Matter of Life and Death</center>

> [!question]+ Review

📖 **Passage to read**: ==Proverbs 09==

> [!info]- 🎙️Audio: [A Daily Devotional - 07.14 - EN]()  

You’ve probably heard those lines before:
“Two roads diverged in a wood, and I—
I took the one less travelled by,
and that has made all the difference.”
That’s the power of a choice. In Proverbs 9, we’re given a picture of two women. Not two paths—but two voices, two invitations. Lady Wisdom and Madame Folly.

Lady Wisdom is pictured as someone stable and strong. Her house is built on seven pillars, and she’s prepared a rich feast. She calls out: “Leave your simple ways, and live, and walk in the way of insight” (9:6). Her invitation is clear. She’s calling people away from sin and foolishness, away from shallow, selfish living. And she reminds us again of the core truth in the book of Proverbs: “The fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom, and the knowledge of the Holy One is insight” (9:10). Lady Wisdom stands for a life focused on God and grounded in His Word. She invites everyone, and her offer leads to life.

But Madame Folly also calls out. She’s loud, dramatic—and dangerous. Though she knows nothing, her words still sound tempting. She says things like, “Stolen water is sweet” (9:17). In other words, she tries to convince us that sin is fun and exciting. But her way is deceptive. Her path ends in death. What she promises can never truly satisfy.

This chapter gives us a picture—a strong, memorable image—to help us see our daily choice. It’s not just between wisdom and foolishness. It’s between life and death. It’s between the way of God and the way of the enemy. The way of wisdom is the way of God, and it leads to real life. But sin, no matter how good it looks, leads to ruin.

> [!important]+ Reflect and Respond
Thank God if you’ve already heard and responded to His call. Praise Him for the wisdom and salvation He gives in Jesus. And pray for a heart that sees clearly—like Proverbs does. Ask God to help you guide others to Jesus, the one true source of life, wisdom, and hope.
