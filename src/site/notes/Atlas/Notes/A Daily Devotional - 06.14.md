### <center>命运的逆转</center>

> [!info]- 🎙️Audio: [A Daily Devotional - 06.14 - CN]()

以斯帖为王摆设了筵宴，也请了哈曼。她尚未向王揭示她的重要请求，却答应明日筵宴时说出。那夜，王辗转难眠，便吩咐取来史册，就是记载他国事的书。仆人诵读时，王得知一件要紧事：末底改，就是以斯帖的叔父（王却不知此事），曾揭发并阻止过谋害王的阴谋。王想到末底改未曾因此蒙赏赐，便召哈曼来，问他如何赏赐忠心之人。

哈曼因末底改是犹太人，心存极深的恨意。他已密谋要灭绝波斯帝国内所有犹太人。然哈曼对王的答复，显露他骄傲自负的罪性。他竟以为王问的是他自己，便设计一番荣耀的礼遇，要叫那人披上华服，带着冠冕，骑王的马，在城中游行，众人高声称赞。岂料王竟吩咐将这荣耀给予哈曼所恨的末底改。

次日，筵宴重新开始。以斯帖预备信守对末底改和百姓的诺言，向王揭露哈曼的恶谋。更甚，她坦陈自己乃犹太人，正是哈曼欲灭绝的民族。王愤怒难抑，误以为哈曼向以斯帖恳求是骚扰，怒气腾腾。哈曼的结局已定，无可挽回。忽然，他被带出，挂在自己为末底改预备的绞刑架上。

然而故事尚未完结。王的诏令仍悬挂于波斯全国，要杀灭所有犹太人。我们将在以斯帖记第九章见证神如何保守祂的子民。

> [!important]+ 反思与回应
今日，祷告求神显明你心中尚存的罪性态度，帮助你认罪悔改，离开罪恶，效法救主耶稣，成为更像祂的人。

### <center>Reversal of Fortune</center>

> [!question]+ Review
> 1. ⁠Why could Esther not enter the king’s palace without being summoned? What does this show about the king’s authority?
> 2. ⁠What does Mordecai mean when he says, “You have come to your royal position for such a time as this”? How does this encourage Esther?
> 3. Esther decided to risk her life by going to the king. What does her attitude reveal about her faith and obedience? What kind of risks was she willing to take?

📖 **Passage to read**: ==Esther 06-07==

> [!info]- 🎙️Audio: [A Daily Devotional - 06.14 - EN]()  

Esther held a private banquet for the king and invited Haman. She had not yet revealed her big request but promised to do so at the next day’s feast. That night, the king could not sleep. He called for the book of the chronicles—records of the events during his reign—to be brought to him. As his servants read, the king learned something important: Mordecai, Esther’s uncle (though the king did not know this), had once uncovered and stopped a plot to kill him. The king realized Mordecai had never been properly honored for this loyal act. So, he called Haman to ask how he thought a man like Mordecai should be rewarded.

Haman hated Mordecai deeply because he was a Jew. He had already planned to destroy all the Jews in the Persian empire. But his answer to the king showed more about his sinful pride. He assumed the king was talking about honoring him. So, he suggested a grand reward for the man—being dressed in royal robes and led through the city with praise before the king. To Haman’s shock, the king ordered this honor to be given to Mordecai instead.

The next day, the feast began again. Esther prepared to fulfill her promise to Mordecai and her people. She told the king about Haman’s plot. She also revealed that she herself was Jewish—the very people Haman wanted to destroy. The king, already angry, misunderstood Haman’s desperate plea to Esther and became furious. If Haman’s fate was not sealed before, it was now. In a sudden turn, Haman was taken away and hung on the gallows he had built for Mordecai.

But the story was not finished. The king’s decree to kill all Jews still stood. Esther 9 will show how God’s people were saved.

> [!important]+ Reflect and Respond
Today, pray that God would show you any sinful attitudes hidden in your heart. Ask Him to help you see, confess, and turn away from these sins. Pray that you would grow to be more like Jesus, your Savior.
