在《列王纪下》5章中，我们被提醒一个重要的真理：以色列的神不仅仅是以色列的神。他是全世界的神，是所有事物和所有人类的创造者。以色列是神特别的子民，但神的计划远远超越了一个国家。他希望各国的人都能认识他，并敬拜他。

故事发生在叙利亚，位于以色列之外，主人公是一个强大的男人，名叫 Naaman，叙利亚王的军队指挥官。Naaman 以他的军事成就闻名，但他有一个重大问题：麻风。尽管他拥有强大的力量和辉煌的成就，但他无法抵挡这个可怕的疾病。在神的旨意下，Naaman 家中有一个以色列的小女仆，她告诉他以色列的先知以利沙能够治愈他。于是 Naaman 前往以色列，尽管他最初对以利沙奇怪的命令——让他在脏污的约旦河里洗澡——感到犹豫，但最终他服从了指示，并奇迹般地治好了麻风。

值得注意的是，Naaman 并不是犹太人，他是外邦人，但神选择了医治他。然而，故事并没有就此结束。Naaman 不仅仅是身体得到了医治，他的灵魂也经历了转变。在他的治愈之后，他宣告说：“看哪，除了以色列以外，遍地没有神。”这句话意义重大。神的医治、祝福和救恩并非仅限于以色列人；它是为所有民族、所有愿意信靠唯一真神的人准备的。这个思想并非仅仅出现在旧约中。多年后，耶稣将这一点告诉了当时的犹太宗教领袖们，指出神对所有民族都有关心，而不仅仅是犹太人。

> [!important]+ 反思与回应
当我们反思这一段经文时，它提醒我们神的全球性使命。祈求神赐给我们一颗心，去关心所有的人，不论他们的背景或种族。渴望那一天，当来自各国、各族、各方言的人们聚集在天上，敬拜耶稣——那位为拯救罪人而被杀的羔羊。

📖 **Passage to read**: ==2 Kings 05==

> [!info]- 🎙️Audio: [A Daily Devotional - 05.20 - EN]()  


In 2 Kings 5, we are reminded of a vital truth: the God of Israel is not just the God of Israel. He is the God of the entire world, the Creator of all things and all people. Israel is his special people, but his plan is far bigger than one nation. He desires that people from all nations come to know him and worship him.

The story begins in Syria, outside the land of Israel, and it involves a powerful man named Naaman, the commander of the Syrian army. Naaman was famous for his military achievements, but he had one major problem: leprosy. Despite all his strength and accomplishments, he was helpless against this terrible disease. In God’s providence, Naaman’s household had a young Israelite servant girl. She told him about the prophet Elisha in Israel, who could heal him. So Naaman went to Israel, though he initially hesitated at Elisha’s unusual instruction to wash in the Jordan River. But after obeying, he was miraculously healed of his leprosy.

It’s important to note that Naaman was not a Jew. He was a Gentile, yet God chose to heal him. But the story doesn’t end there. Naaman wasn’t just physically healed—he was also spiritually transformed. After his healing, he declared, "Behold, I know that there is no God in all the earth but in Israel." This statement is significant. God’s healing, blessing, and salvation are not just for the Israelites; they are for everyone, from every nation, who puts their faith in the one true God. This idea isn’t just an Old Testament concept. Years later, Jesus would challenge the Jewish religious leaders of his time, pointing out that God cares about all nations, not just the Jewish people.

> [!important]+ Reflect and Respond
As we reflect on this passage, it’s a reminder of God’s global vision. Pray for a heart that shares his concern for all people, no matter their background or ethnicity. Long for the day when people from every nation, tribe, and language will gather together in heaven to worship Jesus, the Lamb who was slain to save sinners.
