### <center>在神话语之下的生命</center>

> [!info]- 🎙️Audio: [A Daily Devotional - 06.08 - CN]()

尼希米带领神的子民，经历了许多艰难挑战。耶路撒冷的城墙重建了，城池看似再度稳固。但这真的是安全了吗？归回的被掳民不仅需要坚固的城墙和保护，他们更需要活在神的话语之下。城墙虽然建立，然而人更需立于神的掌权之下。

当百姓被点算并有序编组（参见尼希米记第七章）后，众人齐聚一堂。这里我们认识一位熟悉的人物：以斯拉，神子民的伟大祭司，他将律法书带出来，当众朗读。整整一个上午，百姓站着敬拜，静听神的话。还有祭司们穿行在人群中，帮助解释朗读的内容，使众人明白其中的意义（尼希米记8:8）。这不仅仅是朗读，更是神子民在神的地上归回神话语的盛大时刻。

以斯拉和尼希米深知一件重要的事：仅仅重建城墙和圣殿还不够，神的子民必须重新听从、顺服并活出神的话语。

百姓的回应有两种。首先，许多人哭泣，他们意识到自己远离神的诫命，为自己的过犯感到悲伤。但尼希米和以斯拉没有让百姓长久停留在忧伤中，他们提醒大家这一天应当是喜乐与圣洁的日子。他们吩咐百姓吃喝欢庆，赞美那带领他们归回故土、且必借着话语继续引导他们的神。

其次，百姓不只是听了神的话，还开始顺服。他们恢复了神所吩咐的律例和习俗。如今，他们重返故土，城墙已立，重新活在那位全能神的话语之下。

> [!important]+ 反思与回应
神子民真正的安全——无论当时还是现在——唯有活在祂的话语之中。今天，就祈求神帮助你在顺服祂的话语中找到安稳——信靠耶稣，跟随祂，通过听祂的话敬拜祂，并遵行祂一切的吩咐。

### <center>Life under God’s Word</center>

> 1. How did Sanballat and Tobiah oppose Nehemiah and the workers rebuilding the walls of Jerusalem?

📖 **Passage to read**: ==Nehemiah 08==

> [!info]- 🎙️Audio: [A Daily Devotional - 06.08 - EN]()  

Nehemiah led God’s people through great challenges. The walls of Jerusalem have been rebuilt, and the city looks secure once again. But is it truly safe? The returned exiles need more than just strong walls and protection. They need to live under God’s word. The walls may stand, but the people must stand under God’s rule.

After the people were counted and organized (see Nehemiah 7), everyone gathered together. Here we meet a familiar figure: Ezra, the priest who led God’s people. He brought out the book of the Law and read it aloud before all the people. For a whole morning, they listened and worshiped. Some of the priests helped by explaining what was read, so the people understood the meaning (Nehemiah 8:8). This was not just a reading, but a great moment of returning to God’s word in God’s place.

Ezra and Nehemiah understood something important: rebuilding the walls and the temple was not enough. God’s people had to return to hearing, obeying, and living under God’s commands.

The people responded in two ways. First, many wept. They realized how far they had fallen from God’s commands and felt sorrow for their sins. But Nehemiah and Ezra did not let the people stay in sadness. They reminded them this day was for joy and holiness. They told the people to eat, drink, and celebrate God who brought them back to their land and would guide them through His word.

Second, the people did more than listen—they began obeying. They restored the customs God had commanded. They were back in their land, with walls rebuilt, living again under the word of their powerful God.

> [!important]+ Reflect and Respond
True security for God’s people—then and now—comes only from living under His word. Today, pray and ask God to help you find your security in obeying His word—trusting Jesus, following Him, worshiping Him by listening to Him, and doing all He commands.
