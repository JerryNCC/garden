### <center>新王，却是同一位神</center>

> [!info]- 🎙️Audio: [A Daily Devotional - 01.31 - CN]()


《出埃及记》以对神信实的有力提醒开篇。第7节写道：“以色列人生养众多，并且繁茂，极其强盛，满了那地。”想想他们走过的路吧！不久之前，神的子民还只是由亚伯兰和撒莱这对年迈且没有孩子的夫妻组成。现在，仅仅过了几代，他们的后裔就已成为强盛且众多的民族。这清楚地表明，神对亚伯拉罕的应许已经实现。  

然而，第8节却带来了令人不安的转折：“有不认识约瑟的新王兴起，治理埃及。”以色列人的增长和强盛令埃及人感到威胁，这为他们的奴役埋下了伏笔。埃及人强迫他们从事繁重的劳役，受到苛刻和不公的对待。虽然神应许亚伯拉罕的子孙将繁衍增多，但如今他们所遭受的苦难让人不禁要问：这与神的计划有何关系？  

《出埃及记》的故事从神的子民被奴役开始，但却绝不会止步于此。神的计划远不止于此。祂旨在保守、拯救并赐福祂的子民。在整本书中，我们将看到神的计划逐步显现——祂要将子民从奴役中救出来，使他们成为敬拜祂的子民。即使在第一章中，我们也能看到希望的曙光。尽管法老下令杀害所有希伯来男婴，但一些勇敢的埃及助产士不顺从命令。这些敬畏神的妇人因其勇气而蒙福，神也借着她们拯救了许多生命。  

> [!important]+ 反思与回应
神在《出埃及记》中的宏大计划是将祂的子民从奴役中救出来，带领他们进入以祂为中心的敬拜生活。那么，你呢？你是否被某些事物奴役着——骄傲、自私、情欲，或者是罪的捆绑？神渴望借着耶稣释放你，并引导你过一个全然献给祂的生活。今天花些时间祷告吧，求神释放你，帮助你活在对祂的敬拜之中。

📖 **Passage to read**: ==Exodus 01==

> [!info]- 🎙️Audio: [A Daily Devotional - 01.31 - EN]()

The book of Exodus opens with a powerful reminder of God’s faithfulness. Verse 7 says, “But the people of Israel were fruitful and increased greatly; they multiplied and grew exceedingly strong, so that the land was filled with them.” Think about how far they’ve come. Not long ago, God’s people began with just two individuals—Abram and Sarai, an elderly, childless couple. Now, only a couple of generations later, their descendants have grown into a strong and numerous people. This is clear evidence that God has kept His promise to Abraham.  

But then, in verse 8, the tone shifts dramatically with these chilling words: “Now there arose a new king over Egypt, who did not know Joseph.” The Israelites’ growth and strength now alarm the Egyptians, setting the stage for their enslavement. The Egyptians force them into hard labor, treating them harshly and unjustly. While God’s promise to Abraham is being fulfilled in their multiplication, the reality of their suffering raises a question: How does this fit into God’s plan?  

The story of Exodus begins with God’s people in slavery, but it doesn’t end there. God’s plan is much bigger. He intends to preserve, save, and bless His people. Throughout the book, we’ll see God’s purpose unfold: bringing His people out of bondage and into worship. Even in chapter 1, there’s a glimpse of hope. Despite Pharaoh’s command to kill all the Hebrew boys, some brave Egyptian midwives refuse to obey. These women fear God, and He blesses them for their courage, using them to save many lives.  

> [!important]+ Reflect and Respond
God’s overarching plan in Exodus is to deliver His people from slavery and bring them into a life centered on worship. What about you? Are you enslaved to anything—pride, selfishness, lust, or sin in general? God desires to set you free through Jesus and lead you into a life fully devoted to Him. Take a moment today to pray, asking God to deliver you and help you live in worship to Him.
