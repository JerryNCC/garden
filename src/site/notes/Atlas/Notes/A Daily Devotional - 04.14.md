> 1. ⁠为什么我们在大卫和歌利亚的故事中常常误将自己看作大卫，而忽视了自己其实更像那些恐惧的以色列人？这种误解会如何影响我们对这段经文的理解？
> 2. ⁠大卫是如何通过信靠神与歌利亚作战，并最终获得胜利的？这种信靠对我们面对生活中的“巨人”有何启示？

### <center>膏立但未即为王</center>

> [!info]- 🎙️Audio: [A Daily Devotional - 04.14 - CN]()

大卫正身处一个复杂且危险的境地。他已经被撒母耳膏立为以色列的合法王，得到了神的祝福和认可。然而，王位上仍然坐着一位国王——扫罗。扫罗对大卫被神选立的事实以及他在以色列百姓中愈发增强的人气非常不满。

在这一切的过程中，大卫与约拿单之间的友谊依然坚如磐石。约拿单对大卫的爱深沉到，他简直无法相信自己的父亲竟会想要杀害大卫。然而，大卫坚持认为扫罗确实意图伤害他。为了弄清楚真相，约拿单决定通过测试扫罗的反应来探查他的真实意图。测试方式是，若大卫缺席王宫的宴会，看看扫罗会作何反应。结果显而易见——扫罗确实决心要杀死大卫。不仅如此，扫罗还在愤怒中试图用矛刺杀自己的儿子约拿单，因为约拿单支持大卫。

在这一幕的背后，扫罗与约拿单之间的鲜明对比愈发显现。我们已经看到了约拿单对大卫的无私之爱。约拿单爱大卫，并非因为他期待回报，而是因为他真心希望大卫能得到最好的。他信任神对他们两人以及以色列全体的计划。这种无私的爱是扫罗无法理解的。扫罗是一个被自豪、私欲和个人雄心所驱使的人，他对这种奉献的爱视而不见。他的话语暴露了他的内心：“只要耶西的儿子还活在地上，你和你的王国就不能建立。所以……他必定死。”（撒母耳记上 20:31）。扫罗无法理解约拿单会为了神所立的王而放下自己的雄心壮志。扫罗被自己的骄傲与仇恨所吞噬，而约拿单则谦卑地顺服神的旨意，哪怕这意味着要作出个人的牺牲。

> [!important]+ 反思与回应
约拿单不仅是一个真正基督徒友谊的典范——他还是一个为了神的计划放下个人野心的人。他主动让位，腾出空间来让神的旨意得以实现，即便这需要他做出牺牲。我们也被召唤去做同样的事情。正如约拿单让位给大卫，我们也应当让开道路，引领他人看向真正的王——耶稣，并将荣耀归于他的国度。

### <center>Anointed but Not Yet King</center>

> [!question]+ Review
> 1. Why do we often mistakenly identify ourselves as David in the story of David and Goliath, overlooking the fact that we are more like the fearful Israelites? How might this misunderstanding affect our interpretation of the passage?
> 2. How did David fight Goliath by trusting in God and ultimately gaining victory? What does this trust teach us when we face the "giants" in our own lives?
> 3. ⁠ ⁠Why is Jesus the true champion in this story? How should we respond to the sacrifice Jesus made for us and participate in His mission?

📖 **Passage to read**: ==1 Samuel 20==

> [!info]- 🎙️Audio: [A Daily Devotional - 04.14 - EN]()  

David finds himself in a complicated and dangerous situation. He has already been anointed by Samuel as the king of Israel, with God’s blessing and approval. However, there is still a king on the throne—Saul. And Saul is not happy about the fact that David has been chosen by God and has become incredibly popular among the people of Israel.

Through all of this, the friendship between Jonathan and David remains incredibly strong. Jonathan’s love for David is so deep that he cannot believe his own father would want to kill him. David, however, insists that Saul does indeed intend to harm him. To find out for sure, Jonathan agrees to investigate Saul’s true intentions by testing his reaction when David does not show up to a banquet in the king’s palace. The results are clear—Saul is indeed determined to kill David. Not only does Saul openly declare his desire to see David dead, but in a fit of rage, he even throws a spear at his own son, Jonathan, because of his support for David.

In the midst of this investigation, the differences between Saul and Jonathan become painfully obvious. We have already seen Jonathan’s selfless love for David. Jonathan loves David, not because he expects something in return, but because he genuinely wants the best for David. He trusts God’s plan for both their lives and for Israel as a whole. This kind of selfless love is something Saul cannot understand. Saul, a man driven by pride, self-interest, and personal ambition, is blind to this kind of sacrificial love. His words expose his heart: “As long as the son of Jesse lives on the earth, neither you nor your kingdom shall be established. Therefore… he shall surely die” (1 Samuel 20:31). Saul cannot fathom the idea that Jonathan would set aside his own ambitions for the good of God’s chosen king. Saul is consumed by his own pride and hatred, while Jonathan humbly submits to God’s will, even when it costs him.

> [!important]+ Reflect and Respond
Jonathan is not just a model of true Christian friendship—he is an example of someone who puts aside his own ambitions for the sake of God’s plan. He steps out of the way to make room for God’s will to be done, even when it involves his own personal sacrifice. We, too, are called to do the same. Just as Jonathan made way for David, we must step aside and point others to the true King, Jesus, and the glory of His kingdom.
