按理说，作为王后，她理应可以向王提出请求，甚至略微左右丈夫的决定！但以斯帖的处境并非如此。王拥有极大的权柄，甚至掌控王后。王的权势如此之大，以至于以斯帖若未经王召唤，擅自进入内廷，必面临死罪。她向末底改说明：“凡人或女人若擅自进入王宫内廷，非王召唤，只有一条律法，就是治死，惟有王若向他伸出金杖，准他存活”（以斯帖记4:11）。更危险的是，她尚未向亚哈随鲁王揭露她的犹太人身份——那正是王所颁旨欲灭绝的民族。

在末底改的回应中，我们几乎可以看到神的隐秘作为，虽然未直接提到神的名。末底改那句著名的话提醒以斯帖，神的主权计划正在运行，她的生命与地位极可能是神旨意中的重要一环。他对以斯帖说：“或许你得了王后的位分，就是为现今的机会”（4:14）。末底改明白，神隐藏的手，可能安排以斯帖坐在高位，为保护祂的百姓。

以斯帖的回应显出她的信心——这信心值得我们效法，坚定为主耶稣和祂的子民站立。她决意冒死进入王宫，愿意承担生命的风险。她说：“我若死，就死吧！”（4:16）。以斯帖不把王后的尊荣当作个人的荣耀，而是看作神赐予她的恩典，神主权计划中的工具。

> [!important]+ 反思与回应
她勇敢承担生命危险，明白神将她放在那个位置，是为服事祂的百姓。愿你今日祷告，求神使你的成功和影响力，成为荣耀神、传扬耶稣基督恩典和爱的良机。

📖 **Passage to read**: ==Esther 03==

> [!info]- 🎙️Audio: [A Daily Devotional - 06.13 - EN]()  

A queen might seem to have the freedom to ask the king for anything, even to persuade him strongly. But Esther’s situation was different. The king held great power and authority—even over his wife. He was so powerful that Esther feared for her life if she entered the king’s presence without being officially summoned. She told Mordecai: “If anyone, man or woman, goes to the king inside the inner court without being called, there is only one law—they must be put to death, unless the king holds out his golden scepter to them so they may live” (4:11). On top of that, Esther had not yet told King Ahasuerus the most dangerous truth—that she was a Jew, part of the people the king’s decree was about to destroy.

In Mordecai’s response, we get the closest hint of God in the book, though God’s name is not mentioned. Mordecai’s famous words remind Esther that God’s sovereign plan may be at work—and that her life and position might be part of God’s purpose. His question to Esther finally pushes her to act: “Who knows whether you have not come to the kingdom for such a time as this?” (4:14). Mordecai recognizes that God’s hidden hand might have placed Esther where she could protect God’s people.

Esther’s reply shows her faith—faith we should imitate as we stand firm for Jesus and his people. She decides to risk her life and approach the king. Her words reveal her courage: “I will go to the king, even though it is against the law, and if I perish, I perish” (4:16). Esther accepted her royal position not for her own sake, but as a gift from God, part of his sovereign plan.

> [!important]+ Reflect and Respond
Esther took a great risk, knowing that God had placed her where she was to serve his people. Pray that your success and positions of influence become opportunities to glorify God and share his love and grace in Jesus Christ.
