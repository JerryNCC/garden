### Essay Question: Identification of an Unknown Salt

You are provided with an unknown salt. Your task is to identify the salt by performing a series of tests and making step-by-step deductions based on your observations. 

#### Information:
- **Appearance of the Salt**: The unknown salt appears as a **white crystalline powder**.

#### Heating of salt:
- **Observation**: 
	- release brown gas that **turn moist blue litmus paper red**.
	- release colorless gas that **rekindles the glowing splinter**.
> [!info]- Deduction
> This confirms the presence of nitrogen gas and oxygen.
#### Tests for Cation and Anion:

1. **Test for Cation (Metal Ion)**:
    - **Procedure**: Add a few drops of **sodium hydroxide (NaOH)** to a small amount of the salt dissolved in water.
    - **Observation**: **No precipitate** forms. 
> [!info]- Deduction
> This confirms the presence of ammunia solution. 

2. **Test for Anion (Non-Metal Ion)**:
    - **Procedure**: Add dilute sulphuric acid ($\ce{H2SO4}$), add iron (II) sulphate solution  ($\ce{FeSO4}$), add concentrated sulphuric acid  ($\ce{H2SO4}$)
    - **Observation**: Brown ring is obtained.
> [!info]- Deduction
> This confirms the presence of nitrate ion.
#### Confirmatory Tests:

1. **Confirmatory Test**:
    - **Procedure**: add few drops of **Nessler's reagent** into the salt.
    - **Observation**: A **brown precipitation** is formed.
> [!info]- Deduction
> This indicates the presence of **Ammonium ions ($\ce{NH4}$)**.

#### Task:
Based on the information provided and the results from the tests, identify the unknown salt. Write a detailed essay that outlines each step of the process, from observing the appearance of the salt, conducting the tests for the cation and anion, and applying the confirmatory tests. Your deductions should lead to the identification of the salt.

> [!warning]- Answer:
> - **Ammonium Nitrate (NH₄NO₃)** is a **white crystalline** solid.
> - **Ammonium ions (NH₄⁺)** produce **ammonia gas (NH₃)** when treated with **sodium hydroxide (NaOH)**, which has a characteristic pungent smell.
> - **Nitrate ions (NO₃⁻)** can be confirmed by the **brown ring test** using **iron(III) chloride (FeCl₃)** solution.
