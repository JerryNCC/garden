### Essay Question: Identification of an Unknown Salt

You are provided with an unknown salt. Your task is to identify the salt by performing a series of tests and making step-by-step deductions based on your observations. The salt in question is **Ammonium Nitrate (NH₄NO₃)**.

#### Information:
- **Appearance of the Salt**: The unknown salt appears as a **white crystalline powder**.

#### Tests for Cation and Anion:

1. **Test for Cation (Metal Ion)**:
    - **Procedure**: Add a few drops of **sodium hydroxide (NaOH)** to a small amount of the salt dissolved in water.
    - **Observation**: **No precipitate** forms, but **ammonia gas (NH₃)** is produced with a **pungent smell**, which can be detected by its characteristic odor. This confirms the presence of **ammonium ions (NH₄⁺)**.

2. **Test for Anion (Non-Metal Ion)**:
    - **Procedure**: Add a few drops of **silver nitrate (AgNO₃)** solution to a small amount of the salt solution.
    - **Observation**: **No precipitate** forms, indicating the absence of halide ions like chloride (Cl⁻). This suggests the anion is not halide-based.

#### Confirmatory Tests:

1. **Confirmatory Test for Ammonium**:
    - **Procedure**: Add a few drops of **sodium hydroxide (NaOH)** to a small portion of the salt solution and heat gently.
    - **Observation**: **Ammonia gas (NH₃)** is released, which has a **pungent odor** and can turn **moist red litmus paper blue**, confirming the presence of **ammonium ions (NH₄⁺)**.

2. **Confirmatory Test for Nitrate**:
    - **Procedure**: Add a few drops of **iron(III) chloride (FeCl₃)** solution to a small portion of the salt solution.
    - **Observation**: The formation of a **brown ring** at the junction of the test tube indicates the presence of **nitrate ions (NO₃⁻)**. This confirms the presence of nitrate ions.

---

#### Task:
Based on the information provided and the results from the tests, identify the unknown salt. Write a detailed essay that outlines each step of the process, from observing the appearance of the salt, conducting the tests for the cation and anion, and applying the confirmatory tests. Your deductions should lead to the identification of the salt.

- **Your final answer should include the chemical formula of the salt in LaTeX format**.

---

### Additional Notes:
- **Ammonium Nitrate (NH₄NO₃)** is a **white crystalline** solid.
- **Ammonium ions (NH₄⁺)** produce **ammonia gas (NH₃)** when treated with **sodium hydroxide (NaOH)**, which has a characteristic pungent smell.
- **Nitrate ions (NO₃⁻)** can be confirmed by the **brown ring test** using **iron(III) chloride (FeCl₃)** solution.

---

### Conclusion:
By analyzing the observations from the tests step by step, the unknown salt can be identified as **Ammonium Nitrate (NH₄NO₃)**, which has the chemical formula \( \text{NH}_4\text{NO}_3 \).

---

This approach follows the **SPM format**, with a logical flow of tests for identifying both the **Ammonium (NH₄⁺)** cation and the **Nitrate (NO₃⁻)** anion.
