终于，上帝开口说话了。但祂并没有照我们所期待的方式来回答约伯的问题。祂没有给出理由，也没有说声“对不起”。相反，祂接连发问，一道接一道的问题，彰显出祂远远高过约伯的智慧与权柄，也显明约伯的认知何其有限。若你站在约伯的位置，你会怎样回应神呢？约伯的反应，流露出一位敬畏神之人的内心。

耶和华结束第一段话时，向约伯发出挑战：“强辩的岂可与全能者争论吗？”（约伯记40:2）。约伯没有反驳，也没有申诉，更没有提出新的问题。在苦难与悲伤之中，他选择默然无语。他说：“我说了什么话，我再不回答；就是说过一两次，也不再说了。”（约伯记40:5）。换句话说，他的意思是：“我不再开口了。”他不再挣扎着要明白一切，不再质疑神的美意。他接受了来自万有之主的责备。虽然苦难仍未过去，但他愿意完全顺服神的旨意。这就是信心的回应，我们有许多可以从中学习。

但神并未止步于此。祂再次对约伯说：“你要如勇士束腰，我问你，你可以指示我。”（约伯记40:7）然后继续发问。这一次，神聚焦在祂的公义与大能上——正是约伯曾经怀疑的地方。神提醒他：祂使骄傲人降卑，败坏恶人。随后，神要约伯观看祂所造的一种大兽——河马（或称力大无比的牲畜）。至于这到底是什么动物，学者们至今仍有争论，也许是河马、牛、象或其他。然而神要强调的不是种类，而是：哪怕是你所能想象中最强壮的生物，也只是神手所造。祂远远大过这一切。受造物的力量，不过是祂全能荣耀的一丝反映。

面对这一切，约伯静听神的言语。他没有抵挡，也没有逃避。他领受神的责备。神向他显明祂的权能、公义与无限智慧，并非要击垮他，而是出于爱他的心。这正是约伯所需要的提醒。

> [!important]+ 反思与回应
所以，今天你可以求神帮助你，在艰难时仍仰望祂。祷告祂使你记得：在基督里，祂对你所定的计划是良善且坚定不移的——即便你正经历痛苦与迷惘。求祂帮助你，像约伯那样，掩口不言，全然信靠祂。

> [!question]+ Review
> 1.  ⁠How does God lead Job in chapter 38 to recognize His sovereignty and human limitation? What is the purpose behind all those questions?
> 2. Why does God choose to respond to Job with questions rather than explaining the reason behind his suffering? What does this teach us about faith?
> 3. ⁠When we face suffering or confusion in life, how can we learn from Job’s response to trust God more fully?

📖 **Passage to read**: ==Job 40==

> [!info]- 🎙️Audio: [A Daily Devotional - 06.25 - EN]()  

At last, God speaks. But he doesn’t answer Job’s questions the way we might expect. He doesn’t give reasons. He doesn’t say he’s sorry. Instead, God asks question after question, each one showing how much greater he is than Job—and how small Job’s understanding really is. How would you respond if God spoke to you like that? Job’s reply shows the heart of a man who fears God.

God ends his first speech with a strong challenge: “Shall a faultfinder contend with the Almighty?” (Job 40:2). Job doesn’t fight back. He doesn’t argue. He doesn’t even ask another question. In his pain and sorrow, he puts his hand over his mouth. He says, “I have spoken once, and I will not answer; twice, but I will proceed no further” (Job 40:5). He’s saying, “I’m done talking.” Job stops trying to understand everything. He stops challenging God’s purpose. He accepts what God has said. He’s still in suffering—but he’s ready to trust God fully. This is faith. And we can learn a lot from it.

But God isn’t finished. He tells Job again, “Dress for action like a man” (Job 40:7), and continues with more questions. This time, God focuses on justice and power—the very things Job had started to doubt. God reminds him that he humbles the proud and brings down the wicked. Then he points to one of his great creatures: the Behemoth. People still debate what kind of animal this is—maybe a hippo or an ox or something else. But God’s point is clear: even the strongest creature you can imagine was made by God. God is far greater. And even those creatures show a glimpse of how strong and mighty God is.

Through all this, Job listens. He doesn’t resist. He receives God’s words. God is showing him his power, justice, and wisdom—not to crush him, but because he loves him. That’s what Job needed to see.

> [!important]+ Reflect and Respond
So today, ask God to help you keep your eyes on him—even in hard times. Pray that he would remind you that his plan for you in Christ is good and sure, even when life feels painful and uncertain. And ask him to help you do what Job did: put your hand over your mouth—and trust him completely.
