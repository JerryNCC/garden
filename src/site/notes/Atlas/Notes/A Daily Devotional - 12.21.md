### <center>在耶稣眼中伟大</center>

> [!info]- 🎙️Audio: [None]()


在这段经文中，耶稣向两间教会说话——撒狄教会和非拉铁非教会。你会注意到，对每间教会，耶稣的信息略有不同。大多数教会的信息中都有鼓励和挑战的成分，但通常总体倾向要么是责备，要么是安慰。当你思考耶稣对这两间教会的话时，也可以想想他今天会对你所在的教会说什么。

撒狄看起来是一间信仰已经枯竭、失去生命、甚至表面虚假的教会。他们“有活着的名声”（3:1）——这是一间知名且受尊敬的教会！然而，耶稣发现他们有问题。面对这种死寂和缺乏真实信心的生活，解决之道是什么呢？**就是悔改**。耶稣告诉他们：“要醒悟！”（3:3）这是一群起初信心坚强的人，但他们已经失去了喜乐、生命，以及信仰的真正根基。罪恶潜入了他们的群体，导致敬拜枯干、不真诚。现在是撒狄悔改、醒悟、并记起信心起初的福音的时候了。

耶稣对非拉铁非教会的话语语气则完全不同（不要与美国的费城混淆！）。这是一间与撒狄截然不同的教会；他们“权势不大”（3:8），并没有显赫的名声。然而，他们获得了耶稣能赐予的最高称赞之一：“你遵守我的道，没有弃绝我的名”（3:8）。这间小教会——在世人眼中软弱——却在逼迫和苦难中为耶稣坚立不移。他们持守“忍耐到底”，没有放弃福音（3:10）。对于这间教会，耶稣的话全是鼓励。他指向未来那一天，他们将在“我神的城里”与他永远同在（3:12）。非拉铁非这间小教会比撒狄这间有伟大名声的教会更忠信，而最重要的是，这是耶稣的看法！

> [!important]+ 反思与回应 
你今天是否需要听到耶稣对你说：“醒悟！”？如果需要，就倾听他的话！如果你需要悔改罪过，就现在在神面前悔改。如果你需要被提醒福音的重要性，就花更多时间在神的话语中。让耶稣对这些教会的话语直接触动你的心和生命！

### <center>Great in Jesus’s Eyes</center>

📖 **Passage to read**: ==Revelation 03.01-13==

> [!info]- 🎙️Audio: [None]()  

In this passage, Jesus speaks to two churches—the church at Sardis and the church at Philadelphia. You’ll begin to notice that for every church, the message from Jesus is slightly different. Most have a mixture of encouragement and challenge, but usually the message is overwhelmingly either a rebuke or a comfort. As you consider the words to these two churches, think about what Jesus might say to your local church community.

Sardis, it seems, is a church whose faith has become dry, lifeless, and fake. They have the “reputation of being alive” (3:1)—this is a well-known and well-respected church! Yet Jesus finds fault with them. What is the solution to this deadness and lack of genuine faith-filled life? It is _repentance_. “Wake up,” Jesus tells them (3:3). This is a group of people that started out strong, but they have lost their joy, their life, and the true foundation of their faith. Sin has crept into their community, and it has led to dry and inauthentic worship. It is time for Sardis to repent, wake up, and remember the word of the gospel that was at the beginning of their faith.

The tone of Jesus’s words to Philadelphia (not to be confused with the American city!) is completely different. This is a different kind of church from Sardis; rather than a great reputation, Philadelphia has “but little power” (3:8). Yet they receive one of the greatest compliments Jesus can give: “You have kept my word and have not denied my name” (3:8). This little church—weak in the eyes of the world—has stood strong for Jesus in the midst of persecution and suffering. They have held fast to “patient endurance” and have not let go of the gospel (3:10). For this church, Jesus has nothing but words of encouragement. He points them forward to a day when they will be with him forever in the “city of my God” (3:12). The little church at Philadelphia has proved more faithful than the church with the great reputation. And it’s Jesus’s opinion that matters most!

> [!important]+ Reflect and Respond
_Do you need to hear the voice of Jesus saying to you today, “Wake up!”? If so, listen to him! If there’s repentance of sin that you need to do, do it right now, before God. If you need to be reminded of the gospel, spend some more time in God’s word today. Let Jesus’s words to these churches speak directly to your heart and life!_
