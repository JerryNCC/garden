### <center>智慧的君王</center>

> [!info]- 🎙️Audio: [A Daily Devotional - 05.04 - CN]()

在旧约中，几乎所有人物都有其缺点。即使是神的百姓中的君王和领袖——那些被认为是良善的——也会在某些时刻失败。这提醒我们，需要一位超越堕落人类罪恶复杂性的统治者——一位将完美生活、为人类牺牲并永远掌权的救主。

所罗门的道德复杂性在他的一生中愈加显现，但从一开始就有所体现。《列王纪上》第三章记载了所罗门与法老之女的婚姻，这是他与埃及王结盟的一部分。此举本身就引发了对所罗门品格的质疑，因为神的百姓被指示不要与周围的国家通婚，以保持专心敬拜唯一真神。

尽管有这些缺点，所罗门在《列王纪上》第三章中仍被呈现为一位敬虔忠诚的君王。该段落的核心事件强调了这一点。夜晚，神在梦中显现，问所罗门：“你要我赐给你什么？”所罗门没有选择自私或骄傲的请求，而是谦卑地请求神赐予他智慧，请求神赐给他一颗“聪明的心”来善良地领导他的百姓（3:9）。神对这个请求感到高兴，承诺不仅赐予所罗门智慧，还赐予他超乎想象的财富和荣耀。

紧接着是著名的两位妇人争夺一个婴儿的故事。所罗门巧妙地找出真正的母亲。这样的判决很快在以色列全国传播，所罗门的声誉日益增长，百姓对他们的君王充满敬畏。

> [!important]+ 反思与回应
我们知道，这位智慧君王的理想统治无法持久，但它为我们展现了神最终对祂百姓的旨意——生活在耶稣完美智慧的统治下，祂将永远掌权。今天，当你与神祷告时，思考所罗门统治的画面。求神使你满足于现在生活在耶稣的统治下，并充满希望，期待在永恒中生活在耶稣王国的完美统治下。

### <center>The Wise King</center>

> [!question]+ Review
> 1. ⁠Why does David emphasize being "strong" and walking in God's ways at the end of his life? What impact does this have on Solomon’s future reign?
> 2. Why does David mention Joab and Shimei? Are these commands personal revenge or reflections of a deeper concern for national stability?
> 3. What kind of spiritual values does David’s final speech reflect? How can we apply this attitude of building our lives on God’s word in our own walk of faith?

📖 **Passage to read**: ==1 Kings 03==

> [!info]- 🎙️Audio: [A Daily Devotional - 05.04 - EN]()  

In the Old Testament, nearly all figures have their flaws. Even the kings and leaders of God’s people—those who are considered good—have moments of failure. This highlights our need for a ruler who is free from the sinful complexities of fallen humanity—a Savior who will live perfectly, die sacrificially, and reign eternally.

While Solomon's moral complexities become more evident as his life progresses, they are present from the beginning. 1 Kings 3 starts with Solomon's marriage to Pharaoh's daughter, forming an alliance with Egypt. This action raises questions about Solomon's character, as God's people were instructed not to intermarry with surrounding nations to remain focused on worshiping the one true God.

Despite these shortcomings, Solomon is portrayed in 1 Kings 3 as a godly and faithful king. The central event in this passage underscores this portrayal. One night, God appears to Solomon in a dream and offers to grant him any request. Solomon, resisting selfish or prideful desires, humbly asks for wisdom to govern God's people well, requesting an "understanding mind" (3:9). God is pleased with this request and promises to grant Solomon not only wisdom but also wealth and honor beyond measure.
 The well-known story of the two women disputing over a baby follows this divine encounter. Solomon devises a wise solution to determine the true mother of the child. His judgment becomes widely known, and his reputation grows as the people stand in awe of their king.

> [!important]+ Reflect and Respond
Although we know this idealized image of Solomon's reign doesn't last, it offers a glimpse of God's ultimate plan for His people—living under the perfect and wise rule of Jesus, who will reign forever. As you spend time in prayer today, reflect on Solomon's reign. Ask God to help you be content living under the rule of Jesus now and to fill you with hope for the eternal reign of King Jesus.
