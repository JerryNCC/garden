### <center>罗波安与耶罗波安</center>

> [!info]- 🎙️Audio: [A Daily Devotional - 05.11 - CN]()

罗波安和耶罗波安虽然处于激烈的敌对关系中，但他们有许多共同点。这两位分别统治国家北部和南部的君王，共享一个显著的特点：他们都拒绝神的话语，并且在对神的顺从上存有悖逆的心。

在结束对耶罗波安一生与统治的记载之前，《列王纪》作者简要讲述了一个关于耶罗波安的故事，揭示了他的一些品格。耶罗波安的儿子生病了，于是他派妻子去找先知亚希雅。耶罗波安让妻子乔装打扮前去，这一举动显然表明了他与神的先知之间的关系不太融洽！亚希雅所传给她的信息并非祝福或希望，而是神对耶罗波安及其家族的审判。因为耶罗波安没有像大卫那样遵循神的话语，神应许要降祸于他的家族，甚至宣告要消灭与他有关的所有人。更为严厉的是，耶罗波安的儿子——家族中唯一令神喜悦的成员——在妻子带着先知的消息回家时死去。这看起来似乎非常严酷，对吧？但这再次迫使我们面对一个重要的现实：神对罪的态度极为严肃。神决不会被亵渎。耶罗波安不仅在个人的偶像崇拜中犯了罪，他还通过自己的恶行引导以色列民犯罪（14:16）。

现在，罗波安，耶罗波安的对手，也没有好到哪里去。他的统治被总结为这样一句话：“犹大人在耶和华眼中行了恶事，他们以所犯的罪惹动了耶和华的忌怒，胜过他们列祖所犯的一切罪” （14:22）。罗波安在灵性领导上远不及他的父亲所罗门，尤其是在引领神的百姓走正道方面。他统治下百姓的罪行迅速显现出来，埃及王希实家的入侵，掠夺了所罗门时期积累的财富。罗波安死后，留下了一个分裂的国度，远比他父亲所罗门时期贫弱且不安稳。

> [!important]+ 反思与回应
在阅读这个故事时，让我们确保审视自己——我们的态度和行为——与神的百姓和他们的君王所反映的教训。我们常常追随错误的领导者，我们也容易将信任寄托在神以外的东西上。我们需要一位救主。花些时间反思，祷告并向神认罪。

### <center>Rehoboam and Jeroboam</center>

> [!question]+ Review
> 1. Why did Rehoboam reject the advice of the elders and follow the counsel of his younger friends? What were the consequences of his decision?
> 2. Jeroboam established new places of worship for political reasons—how did this lead to spiritual downfall? How can we avoid bringing pragmatism into our faith?
> 3. How did Solomon's divided heart eventually lead to the division of the kingdom? What steps can we take to guard our hearts and avoid spiritual division?

📖 **Passage to read**: ==1 Kings 14==

> [!info]- 🎙️Audio: [A Daily Devotional - 05.11 - EN]()  

Rehoboam and Jeroboam may have been on opposite sides of a bitter rivalry, but they had a lot in common. Both were rulers of divided halves of a kingdom, and both shared one major trait: they rejected God’s word and lived in disobedience to Him.

Before concluding the account of Jeroboam’s life and reign, the writer of 1 Kings offers a brief story about him that sheds light on his character. Jeroboam’s son falls ill, and so he sends his wife to the prophet Ahijah. The fact that he sends her in disguise tells us something important about how Jeroboam is viewed by the prophets of God! The message Ahijah gives her is not one of hope or blessing. It’s a message of judgment against Jeroboam and his household. Because Jeroboam failed to follow God’s word as David did, God promises to bring harm upon his house, even declaring that He will make an end of every man connected to him. Even more devastating, Jeroboam’s son—the one member of his family who is pleasing to God—dies as soon as Jeroboam’s wife returns with the prophet’s message. This seems harsh, doesn’t it? But it forces us to face a crucial reality once again: God takes sin very seriously. God will not be mocked. Jeroboam sinned against God not only in his personal idolatry but also by leading Israel into sin through his sinful leadership (14:16).
 
 Now, Rehoboam, Jeroboam’s rival, doesn’t come off any better. Here’s how his reign is summed up: “And Judah did what was evil in the sight of the LORD, and they provoked him to jealousy with their sins that they committed, more than all that their fathers had done” (14:22). Rehoboam takes a serious step back from his father Solomon, especially in his spiritual leadership of God’s people. The consequences of the people’s sin under his rule show up almost immediately when Shishak, king of Egypt, attacks Jerusalem and takes much of the wealth Solomon had accumulated. Rehoboam dies, leaving behind a divided kingdom, far poorer and less secure than it was under his father.

> [!important]+ Reflect and Respond
As we read this story, let’s make sure we examine ourselves—our attitudes and actions—in light of what we see in God’s people and their kings. We often follow the wrong leaders. We tend to put our trust in things other than God. What we need is a Savior. Take some time to reflect, pray, and confess these things to God.
