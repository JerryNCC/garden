### <center>罪引致死亡</center>

> [!info]- 🎙️Audio: [A Daily Devotional - 04.17 - CN]()

扫罗的统治起初充满了希望与兴奋。人民因扫罗具有国王的外貌而欢庆他。然而，他的生命和统治最终以悲剧和失落告终。首先，扫罗被以色列的敌人——非利士人打败。其次，他选择结束自己的生命。扫罗没有继续战斗，而是要求他的兵器拿着人杀死他，以了结他的痛苦。当兵器拿的人拒绝后，扫罗便自己跌倒在剑上，在非利士人追上他之前选择自尽。最后，扫罗死后，敌人依然对他进行羞辱。非利士人发现了他的尸体，割下了他的头，并将尸体挂在他们一座庙宇的墙上。

这是扫罗必然的结局——拒绝神的话语、拒绝顺服神的结果。撒母耳记上第31章所描述的这个悲惨结局，向我们展示了不悔改的罪恶带来的后果：失败、绝望与羞耻。请记得，这场战斗中不仅扫罗一人死去，他的儿子约拿单也在其中丧命。扫罗对神话语的叛逆不仅导致了他自身的毁灭，也让他忠诚的儿子约拿单丧命。

在以色列的这场败局和扫罗的悲惨结局中，大卫依旧带领他的随行之人活跃在荒野中。很快，他将接任王位。这位王——神所拣选的王——将不同于扫罗。然而，甚至大卫也无法满足我们对更伟大救赎的渴望。没有任何人类的国王能够真正领导神的百姓，拯救他们脱离罪恶。

> [!important]+ 反思与回应
最重要的是，《撒母耳记上》31章这样的段落应该让我们充满谦卑。它对我们每个人发出严肃的警告。今天，让我们祈祷，求神让我们全心全意地向祂悔改，信靠耶稣基督。求神帮助我们在顺服祂话语的道路上保持忠心。也求神帮助我们，无论年纪多小，都能始终如一地保持信心直到最后。

### <center>Sin Brings Forth Death</center>

> [!question]+ Review
> 1.  ⁠Why was Abigail able to see the bigger story of God in the encounter with Nabal and David? How did her wisdom and humility influence David's decision?
> 2. ⁠How did Abigail remind David of God's greater plan and the bigger picture? What example do her words and actions provide for us?
> 3. ⁠Why did David choose humility and submission to God's plan when faced with Nabal's insult? What does this attitude teach us when dealing with conflict?

📖 **Passage to read**: ==1 Samuel 31==

> [!info]- 🎙️Audio: [A Daily Devotional - 04.17 - EN]()  

Saul’s reign started with such hope and excitement. The people celebrated him because he had the appearance of a king. But his life, and his rule, end in tragedy and loss. First, Saul is defeated by Israel’s enemies—the Philistines. Second, he ends his life by his own hand. Instead of continuing to fight, Saul asks his armor-bearer to kill him, to end his suffering. When the man refuses, Saul falls on his sword, choosing to die before the Philistines can capture him. Third, even after his death, Saul is mocked and disrespected by his enemies. The Philistines find his body, cut off his head, and hang his body on the wall of one of their temples.

This is the tragic end Saul faces—the inevitable outcome of rejecting God’s word and refusing to obey Him. First Samuel 31, which describes this tragic conclusion, shows us what unrepentant sin against God leads to: defeat, despair, and shame. Remember, Saul isn’t the only one who dies in this battle. Jonathan, his son, dies too. Saul’s rebellion against God’s word results not only in his own destruction but also in the loss of his faithful son, Jonathan.

Amid this defeat for Israel and the sad end of Saul, David continues to survive in the wilderness with his group of men. Soon, it will be time for him to take the throne. This king—God’s chosen king—will be different from Saul. But even David will leave us yearning for something greater. No human king will ever be enough to lead God’s people and deliver them from their sins.

> [!important]+ Reflect and Respond
Above all, passages like 1 Samuel 31 should lead us to humility. They serve as a serious warning to each of us. Pray today that you will fully surrender your heart to God, through repentance and faith in Jesus Christ. Ask Him to keep you faithful in obedience to His word. And ask Him, no matter how young you are, to help you remain faithful until the end.
