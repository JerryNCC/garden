### <center>但是百姓没有</center>

> [!info]- 🎙️Audio: [A Daily Devotional - 03.20 - CN]()

《士师记》一开始就带来了震撼！一开始，看起来以色列人正按着神的旨意行事。他们似乎在遵守约书亚的指示，开始征服这片土地。他们在与迦南人和比利洗人作战中取得了重大胜利，攻占了耶路撒冷和周围的城市。然而，接下来发生了变化。一个小小的连接词，改变了局面。正是这些词——“如果”、“而且”、“但是”——在圣经中常常指出一个关键的转折点，引导我们注意经文中的深刻含义。

《士师记》1章21节便出现了第一个重大转折：“然而，便雅悯人没有赶出住在耶路撒冷的耶布斯人。”这是一个警告信号，接下来还有更多的问题。在第28节中提到：“以色列人强盛的时候，就使迦南人服苦工，却没有把他们完全赶出。”而这还不止如此，其他几个支派——以法莲支派、西布伦支派、亚设支派和拿弗他利支派——也未能完全驱逐迦南人和其他异教民族。他们没有完成征服这片土地的使命。

这些民族并没有敬拜唯一的真神，而是崇拜偶像，实施邪恶、暴力和拜偶像的仪式。最重要的是，他们成为了以色列人的诱惑和陷阱。记住，神是忌邪的神，祂要求祂的百姓将所有的敬拜和忠诚献给祂。完全征服这片土地的命令，不仅仅是军事胜利的问题——更是要清除一切偶像、罪恶和诱惑。这关乎神的圣洁，确保祂的百姓能专心单独敬拜祂。

> [!important]+ 反思与回应
当这个命令没有被遵守时，后果显而易见——我们很快就会看到，不顺从的结果带来了问题。让罪恶继续留在我们中间，只会带来灾难。今天，就向神祷告，求祂赐你力量，清除并消灭你生命中的罪。感谢祂通过耶稣基督所赐的恩典，祂的儿子为你的罪在十字架上死去。并求祂帮助你活出一个圣洁、顺服、爱祂的生活，远离为你死的耶稣所死的罪。

### <center>But the People Did Not</center>

> [!question]+ Review
> 1. ⁠Why does Joshua emphasize the recalling of God's salvation and grace at the end of his life? How does this remembrance help the faith of the people?
> 2. ⁠Why does Joshua stress the importance of serving the Lord "in sincerity and in faithfulness"? How does this attitude of service affect their relationship with God?
> 3. Joshua warns the people that "you are not able to serve the Lord." What does this warning teach us as believers today?

📖 **Passage to read**: ==Judges 01==

> [!info]- 🎙️Audio: [A Daily Devotional - 03.20 - EN]()  

The book of Judges opens with a bang! At first, it looks like the people of Israel are doing exactly what they were supposed to do. They seem to be obeying Joshua, and they start by conquering the land. They win a major victory over the Canaanites and the Perizzites, capturing Jerusalem and surrounding cities. But then, something happens. A conjunction, a small word, makes all the difference. It's these little words, the “ifs,” “ands,” and “buts” in Scripture, that often point to a critical turning point in a passage. They lead us to pay closer attention to what is really going on.

The first big “but” comes in Judges 1:21: “But the people of Benjamin did not drive out the Jebusites who lived in Jerusalem.” This is a warning sign for God's people, and there’s more to come. In verse 28, it says, “When Israel grew strong, they put the Canaanites to forced labor, but did not drive them out completely.” And it doesn’t stop there. Other tribes—Ephraim, Zebulun, Asher, and Naphtali—also fail to fully drive out the Canaanites and other pagan people from their territories. They do not complete the conquest of the land.

These nations did not worship the one true God. They worshiped idols and practiced evil, violent, and idolatrous rituals. Most of all, they were a temptation and a trap for the Israelites. Remember, God is a jealous God. He demands the full worship and loyalty of His people. The command to completely conquer the land wasn’t just about military victory—it was about removing all idolatry, sin, and temptation from the land. It was about preserving God’s holiness and ensuring His people would worship Him alone.

> [!important]+ Reflect and Respond
When this command wasn’t obeyed, the consequences were clear—and we will soon see how disobedience led to trouble. Allowing sin to stay among us will only bring disaster into our lives. Ask God today for the strength to clear out and even destroy the sin in your life. Thank Him for the grace He offers through Jesus, His Son, who died for your sins on the cross. And ask Him to help you live a life of holiness, obedience, and love for Him, keeping away from the sin for which Jesus died.
