讲道从故事开始

“申命记”一词字面意思是“第二次律法”。它是五经中的最后一本书——五经是圣经前五卷书的总称，包含了神的律法。申命记可以被看作是摩西关于神律法的一篇长篇讲道。到这本书结束时，摩西的领导将结束，以色列人将在旷野的时光接近尾声，他们将准备好在摩西继任者约书亚的带领下进入应许之地。

申命记一开始就给我们一个线索，关于摩西在讲道中要谈论的内容。叙述者说：“摩西在摩押平原，约旦河以东，开始讲解这律法”（1:5）。摩西的目标很明确：他想向百姓解释神的律法。你可能会认为，他会像讲授课程一样，逐条讲解神的律法。然而，摩西并没有这样做，而是以一个故事开始。

在申命记1至3章中，摩西花时间提醒百姓他们的过去——尤其是他们曾经的失败。他希望他们明白，他们唯一的希望就是完全信靠神。多年来，以色列人多次试图按照自己的方式行事，质疑神的计划。甚至有时，他们曾想回到埃及，重新过奴隶的生活。摩西提醒他们，他们的罪、骄傲和顽固最终导致他们在旷野漂流了四十年！如今，他们唯一的希望是信靠神，神必会守信给他们应许的土地。

我们常常不愿意沉湎于过去，但我们可以从我们的失败中吸取教训。我们的唯一希望就是信靠神，完全跟随耶稣。感谢神为我们的失败提供的恩典，祂赦免我们并邀请我们跟随祂。

### <center>The Sermon Starts with a Story</center>

> [!question]+ Review
> 1. ⁠How does Moses' review of Israel’s response to God's plan reveal their journey? What is the purpose of Moses recounting their history in Deuteronomy 1-3, and how does it help strengthen the faith of the people?
> 2. ⁠Why does Moses emphasize the failures of Israel in Deuteronomy 1-3? What lesson does he want to teach the people through these reminders?
> 3. ⁠How can we apply Moses' lesson in our own lives today by completely trusting God? How does Moses' message of "reviewing the past" help us build our faith and trust in God's plan?

📖 **Passage to read**: ==Deuteronomy 01==

> [!info]- 🎙️Audio: [A Daily Devotional - 02.29 - EN]()  

The word “Deuteronomy” literally means “second law.” It is the final book in the Pentateuch—the first five books of the Bible, which contain God’s law. Deuteronomy can be thought of as a long sermon that Moses gives about God’s law. By the end of this book, Moses’s leadership will come to an end, the Israelites will be near the end of their time in the wilderness, and they will be ready to enter the promised land under Joshua’s leadership.

The book of Deuteronomy starts by giving us a clue about what Moses will talk about in his speech. The narrator says, “Beyond the Jordan, in the land of Moab, Moses undertook to explain this law” (1:5). Moses’s goal is clear: he wants to explain God’s law to the people. You might think that he would start by going through the laws one by one, just like a lecture. But instead, Moses begins with a story.
 In Deuteronomy 1–3, Moses takes time to remind the people of their past—especially all the ways they failed. He wants them to see that their only hope is to trust in God fully. Over the years, there have been many times when the Israelites tried to do things their own way, questioning God’s plan. There were even times when they wished to go back to Egypt and live as slaves. Moses reminds them of where their sin, pride, and stubbornness led them—wandering in the desert for forty years! Their only hope now is to trust God, who will keep His promises and give them the land He promised them.

> [!important]+ Reflect and Respond
We often don’t want to dwell on the past, but we can learn from our mistakes. Our only hope is to trust in God and follow Jesus completely. Thank God for the grace He offers, forgiving us for our failures and inviting us to follow Him.
