### <center>他必不撇下你，也不丢弃你</center>

> [!info]- 🎙️Audio: [A Daily Devotional - 05.31 - CN]()

你是否曾经想过，神会放弃你吗？也许你曾觉得自己已经太过堕落，不配得到神继续的爱与关怀。我自己也曾有过这样的感受！但是朋友，如果《以斯拉记》教给我们什么，那就是神永远不会放弃他的子民。他会信守他的应许，无论如何，始终保持忠信。

《圣经》故事从《列王纪》和《历代志》延续下来，正是这一美丽真理的证明。神完全可以在他子民被掳之后就结束与他们的关系，他这样做是完全公义的。毕竟，神的子民曾犯下重罪，他们的君王转向偶像崇拜，百姓也跟随他们走上了这条悖逆之路。但故事并没有就此结束；神并没有放弃他的子民。

在《以斯拉记》第一章中，我们看到了核心的真理：神主权的恩典关怀，哪怕是在他们被掳期间和被掳之后。你或许会对《以斯拉记》开头提到波斯王古列感到惊讶。是的，犹大被巴比伦王尼布甲尼撒掳去，但在《以斯拉记》事件发生之前，波斯帝国已经征服了巴比伦。古列王的首个举动之一，就是发布诏令，允许被掳的以色列人回到他们的故土，重建耶路撒冷的圣殿。但这不仅仅是古列王个人的决定——这其实是神主权计划的一部分。神的被掳子民正在回到神的土地上。

虽然《以斯拉记》将向我们表明，回到一个物质的土地和重建圣殿并不是神子民的最终答案，但这仍然是一个充满希望的故事。被掳并不是终结！神确实会审判罪恶，但这个故事提醒我们，神永远不会永远抛弃那些真正属于他的人。

> [!important]+ 反思与回应
如果你属于耶稣基督，记住这一点：神永远不会放弃你。他会成就他对你的美好计划，并完成他在你身上开始的工作。你可以为此祷告。如果你曾走在罪恶的道路上，可能需要悔改。也许意味着你需要在祷告中回到十字架，记住你的罪已经通过耶稣的死得到了真正的赦免。

📖 **Passage to read**: ==Ezra 01==

> [!info]- 🎙️Audio: [A Daily Devotional - 05.31 - EN]()  

Have you ever wondered if God might give up on you? Maybe you’ve felt like you’re too far gone, unworthy of God’s ongoing love and care. I know I’ve felt that way at times! But friend, if the book of Ezra teaches us anything, it’s that God will never give up on his people. He keeps his promises, and he remains faithful, no matter what.

The very continuation of the Bible story beyond 2 Kings and 2 Chronicles is proof of this beautiful truth. God could have ended his relationship with his people after their exile, and he would have been just in doing so. After all, the people had sinned greatly. Their kings turned to idol worship, and the people followed them into this disobedience. But the story doesn’t end there; God wasn’t finished with his people.

In Ezra 1, we see the central truth: God’s sovereign and gracious care for his people, even in the midst of and after their exile. You might be surprised to read about King Cyrus of Persia in the first verse of Ezra. Yes, Judah was taken captive by Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babylon, but shortly before Ezra’s events, the Persians conquered Babylon. One of the first acts of King Cyrus was to issue a decree allowing the Israelites in exile to return to their land and rebuild the temple in Jerusalem. But this is not just a random decision by Cyrus—it’s part of God’s sovereign plan for his people. God’s exiled people are returning to his land.

While the book of Ezra will show that returning to a physical land and a rebuilt temple is not the final solution for God’s people, this event still carries great hope. The exile was not the end! God does judge sin, but this story reminds us that he will never permanently abandon those who belong to him.

> [!important]+ Reflect and Respond
If you belong to Jesus Christ, remember this: God will never give up on you. He will fulfill his good purposes for you and complete the work he has started in you. You can pray for that to happen. It may start with repentance if you’ve been wandering down a sinful path. It may mean returning in prayer to the cross and remembering that your sins have truly been forgiven because of Jesus’s death.
