### <center>战争与主权</center>

> [!info]- 🎙️Audio: [A Daily Devotional - 04.19 - CN]()

在扫罗和他的勇士之子约拿单去世后，以色列失去了明确的领导。此时，正是大卫站出来登基的时候。作为一个合神心意的人，大卫寻求神的引导。神告诉他前往希伯伦，犹大人（即以色列南部的人民）立即在那儿膏立大卫为他们的王。

然而，扫罗军队的指挥官亚尼尔却有不同的打算。经历了与非利士人的战斗后，他决定立扫罗的另一位儿子以实波设为以色列的王，统治北方的国土。现在，神的百姓中有了两个竞争的王：大卫，神所拣选的王；以实波设，代表着扫罗即将消逝的王朝。

这一局面，几乎是一场内战，导致了暴力和流血。大卫的军队领袖约押与扫罗的将军亚尼尔展开对抗。这些都是习惯于战斗和暴力的人。在真正的战争开始前，他们在基比翁池旁进行了一场致命的较量。随后的战斗中，约押的军队重创了亚尼尔的军队。战斗后，亚尼尔逃跑，约押的兄弟亚撒黑被亚尼尔杀死，这一事件成了约押永远不会忘记的仇恨。

在阅读这些经文时，我们需要认识到，神完全主宰着这些事件。虽然那时的情形与今天不同，但神在这些残酷的战斗和血腥的冲突中，依然掌管一切细节。我们也看到了，虽然大卫深陷其中，他却没有表现出个人的复仇、骄傲或残暴。他为扫罗的死哀悼，并且尊重那些为扫罗进行妥善埋葬的人。接下来的章节中，大卫更是远离复仇的行为，并且惩罚那些自己采取复仇行为的人（见3:28–34和4:8–12）。大卫是一个遵循神话语的人。

> [!important]+ 反思与回应
即使在暴力中，神仍在掌权，正在设立祂所拣选的王。今天，让我们祈祷，在我们生活中经历动荡、混乱和困境时，能信靠耶稣王在神的右手掌权。祈求神帮助我们今天信靠祂，并明白这位王掌管万国万民。

### <center>War and Sovereignty</center>

> [!question]+ Review
> 1. Why did David show deep respect and love for Saul even after his death? What example does this behavior set for us in handling relationships with enemies?
> 2. Why did David not celebrate Saul's death, even though Saul had repeatedly tried to kill him? How did his fear of God influence his actions?
> 3. ⁠As we reflect on David's example, how can we imitate him in loving those who hurt us, following God's love in the midst of hardship or conflict?

📖 **Passage to read**: ==2 Samuel 02==

> [!info]- 🎙️Audio: [A Daily Devotional - 04.19 - EN]()  

After Saul and his son Jonathan died, Israel was left without clear leadership. It was now David’s time to step forward and claim the throne. As a man after God’s heart, David seeks God’s guidance. God tells him to go to Hebron, and the men of Judah, in the southern part of the kingdom, anoint David as their king.

But Abner, the commander of Saul’s army, has different ideas. He has survived the battle against the Philistines and decides to make Ish-bosheth, another of Saul’s sons, king over Israel in the northern part of the kingdom. Now there are two competing kings: David, chosen by God, and Ish-bosheth, who represents Saul’s fading dynasty.

This situation, nearly a civil war, leads to violence and bloodshed. Joab, the leader of David’s army, faces off against Abner, Saul’s general. These are men of battle and violence. Before the real fight begins, they play a deadly war game near the pool of Gibeon. After this, the battle starts, and Joab’s forces defeat Abner’s army. The chase that follows is fierce, and Abner kills Joab’s brother, Asahel, an act that Joab will not forget.

As we read these passages, it’s important to understand that God is completely sovereign over all these events. While the times were different, God was still in control of every detail of these brutal battles and bloody conflicts. We also see that David, though deeply involved in the conflict, remains blameless of personal vengeance, pride, or brutality. He mourned Saul’s death and honored those who gave him a proper burial. Later, in the chapters to come, David distances himself from acts of revenge and punishes those who take matters into their own hands (see 3:28–34 and 4:8–12). David is a man who follows God’s word.

> [!important]+ Reflect and Respond
Even in the midst of violence, God is at work, setting up His chosen king. Let us pray today that, in times of unrest and hardship, we would trust that King Jesus reigns at the right hand of God. Pray that God would help you trust Him today, knowing that the King is in control over all nations and peoples.
