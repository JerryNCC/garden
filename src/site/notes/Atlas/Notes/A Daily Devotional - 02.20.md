### <center>怀念埃及的享乐</center>

> [!info]- 🎙️Audio: [A Daily Devotional - 02.20 - CN]()

在这一章开始时，我们看到以色列人向神抱怨。表面上看，他们似乎是在抱怨食物——每天只有从天降下的玛拿。他们回忆起在埃及时吃过的各种食物——黄瓜、瓜类、大葱、洋葱和大蒜。但其实，他们的抱怨不仅仅是食物问题。真正的问题在于，他们渴望的是埃及的享乐——那里的整个生活体验，而不是信靠神和摩西，依靠他们的引导并相信神会履行对他们的应许。

现在，让我们稍作反思。你是否曾经像以色列人一样，尽管神已经施行了如此伟大的救恩，你仍然渴望世上的享乐，抱怨每天服事和顺服耶稣的生活单调乏味？我们每个人都可能犯这个错，太过常见。我们忘记了每天感谢神的救恩和祂所赐的供应。

虽然神回应了他们的抱怨，将肉从天降下，但这并不是他们所期待的礼物，反而成为了对他们叛逆态度的审判。正如33节所说：“肉还在他们牙齿之间，神就降下大灾殃，打死了他们中间许多人。”这不仅不是一种祝福，反而是神对他们叛逆言行的惩罚。

从这段经文中，我们得到了一个重要的教训：神将最严厉的审判留给那些怀疑祂的美好应许并拒绝祂所立领导者的人。这正是以色列人所做的事情。他们拒绝摩西——神为他们所选的领导者，怀疑神应许的真实与实现。他们怀念埃及的享乐——那个曾经使他们为奴的地方。神不希望祂的百姓再回头怀念那个曾让他们受困的地方。祂希望他们跟随祂所立的领导者，信靠祂必定会实现祂的应许。

> [!important]+ 反思与回应
想一想，你是否曾经渴望世上的东西，渴望那些如果没有耶稣，仍会让你被罪恶捆绑的享乐。我们每个人都难免有过这样的时刻。今天，向神认罪，求祂帮助你每天跟随祂所立的领袖——耶稣。求祂帮助你信靠祂的美好应许。祂已应许通过基督拯救你，借着圣灵将你拉近祂，赐给你永生和在祂里的喜乐。不要满足于低于这些的任何东西！

### <center>Pining After Egyptian Pleasures</center>

> [!question]+ Review
> 1. ⁠Why does God specifically command the Israelites to celebrate the Passover in the wilderness in Numbers 9:1-14? What message does this passage convey?
> 2. ⁠Why does God allow those who are unclean due to contact with dead bodies to participate in the Passover celebration? What does this practice reveal about God's attitude towards His people?
> 3. ⁠What does the guidance of the cloud in the second half of Numbers 9 symbolize? How can we today learn from this symbol of being led by God?

📖 **Passage to read**: ==Numbers 11==

> [!info]- 🎙️Audio: [A Daily Devotional - 02.20 - EN]()  

At the beginning of this chapter, we see the Israelites complaining to God. On the surface, it seems like they are complaining about their food—just manna from heaven, day after day. They look back on the variety of foods they ate in Egypt—cucumbers, melons, leeks, onions, and garlic. But their complaint is about more than just food. The real issue is that they are longing for the pleasures of Egypt, the entire experience of living there, rather than trusting God and Moses to lead them well and fulfill His promises.

Now, let’s take a moment to reflect. Have you ever found yourself in the same position as the Israelites? Despite God’s gracious salvation, do you ever crave the pleasures of the world and complain about the seemingly monotonous life of serving and obeying Jesus day in and day out? We all do this more often than we’d like to admit. We forget to be thankful for God’s salvation and the daily provision He gives us.Though God does answer their complaint and sends meat from heaven, it’s not the gift they were hoping for. Instead, it becomes a form of judgment. As verse 33 tells us, “while the meat was yet between their teeth,” God sent a plague that caused many of them to die. This was not a blessing, but a consequence of their rebellious attitude and words.

From this passage, we learn an important lesson: God reserves His harshest judgment for those who doubt His good promises and reject the leadership He has appointed. That’s exactly what the Israelites were doing. They were rejecting Moses, the leader God had chosen for them, and doubting the reality of God’s promises. They were longing for the pleasures of Egypt—the place where they had been enslaved. God does not want His people to look back with longing at the place where they were once bound. He wants them to follow His chosen leader and trust that He will keep His promises to them.Think about the times when you long for the things of the world, the sins that, without Jesus, would still have you in slavery. We all fall into this trap from time to time. 

> [!important]+ Reflect and Respond
Today, confess this to God and ask for His help to follow His chosen leader—Jesus—every day. Ask Him to help you trust His good promises. He has promised to save you in Christ, keep you close to Him through the Holy Spirit, and give you eternal life and joy in Him. Don’t settle for anything less than this!
