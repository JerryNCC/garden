### <center>那只山羊</center>

> [!info]- 🎙️Audio: [A Daily Devotional - 02.14 - CN]()

在《利未记》10:1-3中，我们读到了亚伦的两个儿子，拿答和亚比户的悲剧性死亡。由于他们不按神的吩咐行事，擅自接近神的圣所，他们犯了严重的错误。他们没有认真对待神的圣洁，结果因为他们轻率的行为，被神的审判当场击杀。这一事件成为了神向摩西颁布关于以色列人重要日子的指示的背景：赎罪日。这个日子是专门设立的，每年一次，祭司要为全体百姓（包括祭司自己）的罪献上特别的祭物。

为了更清楚地理解这段经文，可以注意到赎罪的过程是从祭司的罪开始，逐步向百姓的罪扩展。亚伦首先沐浴，穿上特定的祭司服装，准备好执行这个神圣的使命。他不是空手而来，而是带来了几只动物，分别为他自己和百姓献祭。首先，宰杀一头公牛，作为亚伦的罪祭；接着，宰杀一只山羊，作为百姓的罪祭。但是这个仪式的最后部分有所不同。不是把最后一只山羊献祭，而是将其放逐到旷野。这只山羊象征性地将以色列百姓的所有罪孽远远带走，亚伦将百姓的罪放在山羊头上，口头承认他们的罪。

要处理堕落之人的罪，是一项极其艰巨的任务。恢复人与神之间的关系需要付出极大的努力。随着圣经的展开，我们会看到，赎罪的过程不仅困难，最终靠人的努力是无法完成的。神的百姓需要一位完美、最终的祭物——既是人的，也是神的，才能彻底解决他们的罪。

> [!important]+ 反思与回应
跟随耶稣的美好之处在于，我们不再需要为自己的赎罪或赦免而努力。耶稣已经为我们完成了这一切！就像那只“替罪羊”，祂被从神的百姓中除去，承担了他们的罪和负担。今天，相信神已经通过耶稣完成了你的救赎。然后，怀着感恩的心，求神赐给你力量，跟随祂，因为祂已经宽恕了你，并拯救了你。

### <center>The Goat</center>

> [!question]+ Review
> 1. What rituals did Aaron and his sons undergo in Leviticus 8, and what role did these rituals play in the consecration of the priests?

📖 **Passage to read**: ==Leviticus 08==

> [!info]- 🎙️Audio: [A Daily Devotional - 02.14 - EN]()  

In Leviticus 10:1–3, we read about the tragic death of Aaron’s two sons, Nadab and Abihu. They made the fatal mistake of approaching the presence of God in an unauthorized way. They did not take God's holiness seriously, and in their careless actions, they were struck dead by His judgment. This event serves as the backdrop for God’s instructions to Moses about an important day for His people: the Day of Atonement. This was a day set aside for a unique sacrifice, made only once a year, to cover the sins of all the people, including the priests.

To understand this passage more clearly, notice how the atonement process moves outward, starting with the priest’s sins and then extending to the sins of the people. Aaron begins by bathing and dressing in specific garments, preparing himself for the sacred task. He doesn’t come empty-handed but brings several animals to be sacrificed—for both himself and for the people. The sacrifices start with a bull, which is killed as a sin offering for Aaron, followed by a goat, offered as a sin offering for the people. But the last part of the ritual is different. Instead of sacrificing one final goat, it is sent away into the wilderness. This goat symbolically carries all the sins of God’s people far away, as Aaron confesses the people’s sins by placing his hands on the goat.

Dealing with the sins of fallen people is a huge task. It takes so much to restore their relationship with a holy God. As the Bible continues, we will see that the atonement process for God’s people is not only difficult but ultimately impossible through human effort alone. God’s people will need a perfect, final sacrifice—both human and divine—to fully deal with their sins once and for all. The beauty of following Jesus is that we no longer have to work to earn our atonement or forgiveness. Jesus has done that for us! Like the scapegoat, He was sent away from God’s people to carry their sins and guilt. 

> [!important]+ Reflect and Respond
Today, trust that God has accomplished your salvation through Jesus. And then, with a heart of gratitude, ask Him to give you the strength to follow Him—because He has already forgiven and saved you.
