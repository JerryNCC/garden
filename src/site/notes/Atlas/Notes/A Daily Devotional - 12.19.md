可怕的兽、大蝎子、骑着马的幽灵骑士——这些只是《启示录》中一些令人惊奇的景象，很容易让我们把它当作科幻小说，而非现实的启示。书中充满了陌生的异象、激烈的争战以及宇宙性的事件，它吸引我们，却常常让人感到困惑。有些基督徒干脆放弃阅读，“耶稣最终得胜，这就够了，”他们说。但更好的做法是认真研读《启示录》，努力去理解它！神将这本书放入圣经，是有目的的——为了鼓励我们，为了我们的属灵健康。因此，我们必须深入研读这本书！

正如开篇经文所显示的，《启示录》是神赐给使徒约翰的一幅宏伟异象，他将其记录下来，为当时神的子民，也为我们今天的信徒所用。这启示是神为了“向他的仆人们显示那些必须快成的事”（1:1）而赐给约翰的。因此，这本书有强烈的未来导向；这大概并不令人惊讶。《启示录》告诉我们这个世界的最终去向，以及这个宏大故事将如何终结。这是从创世记第一章神创造世界开始的故事，它将在基督再来审判世界、完全救赎并奖赏所有真正子民时得以完成。朋友，《启示录》告诉我们，我们故事的最终篇章。

请花几分钟默想今天经文的最后一句话。约翰告诉我们：“时候近了”（1:3）。我们不知道确切的时间；圣经明确指出，耶稣的再来将是出乎意料的。但我们需要明白——从约翰和圣经的角度来看——我们正生活在末世。时候近了。耶稣将再来审判世界，这地球将终结，新天新地将建立，神将永远在他的子民中掌权。你准备好迎接这一天了吗？

> [!important]+ 反思与回应 
求神使你为耶稣的再来预备好自己，并为救主将来的审判和国度感到喜乐。祈求神帮助你深入研读这本宏伟的书卷，勇敢相信其中的真理，并以真诚的悔改和 genuine faith（真实信心）回应。

📖 **Passage to read**: ==Revelation 01:01-03==

> [!info]- 🎙️Audio: [None]()  

A frightening beast, giant scorpions, ghostly riders on horses—these are just a few of the features of the book of Revelation that can tempt us to think of it as science fiction rather than reality. Full of unfamiliar visions, great battles, and cosmic events, it is a book that intrigues us but often leaves us confused. Some Christians give up on it completely. “Jesus wins,” they say, “that’s all I need to know.” But it’s better to dig in to it and get serious about trying to understand Revelation! God has put Revelation in our Bible on purpose for us—for our encouragement and for our spiritual health. Therefore, dig in to this book!

The book of Revelation, as we find in the opening verses, is a grand vision that God gave to the apostle John, which he wrote down for the benefit of God’s people in his day and in ours. This revelation was given to him so that God could “show to his servants the things that must soon take place” (1:1). So there is a future-oriented focus to this book; that’s probably not surprising to you! Revelation tells us where this world is going and how this grand story will ultimately end. This is the ending to the story that began way back in Genesis 1 with God’s creation of the world. It is the story that will finally be completed with Christ’s return to judge the world and to perfectly redeem and reward all his true people. Friend, Revelation tells us about the final chapter of _our story_.

Meditate for a few moments on the final phrase of today’s passage. John tells us that “the time is near” (1:3). We do not know exactly how soon; the Bible makes clear that Jesus’s return will be unexpected. But we need to understand that—in the perspective of John and of the Bible—we are living in the last days. The time is near. Jesus will return to judge the world. This earth will end, and the new heavens and new earth will be established, with God reigning over his people forever. Are you ready for that?

> [!important]+ Reflect and Respond
_Ask God to make you ready for Jesus to return and excited about the coming judgment and reign of your Savior. Pray that God would help you dig in to this great book and be challenged to believe its words—and to respond with true repentance and genuine faith!_
