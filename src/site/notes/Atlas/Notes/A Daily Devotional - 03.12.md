约书亚清晨早早起床，开始朝着约旦河进发。代表神同在的约柜在前引领，整个社区都准备跟随约书亚进入应许之地。在第七节，神对约书亚说了一个重要的信息：“今天我必在以色列众人面前开始尊贵你，使他们知道，正如我与摩西同在，我也必与你同在。”神即将做的事有一个明确的目的：祂要向百姓显明，祂与约书亚同在，正如当年与摩西同在一样。当百姓接近约旦河时，约书亚向他们解释接下来会发生什么：“你们必知道活神在你们中间，并且他必毫无例外地赶出你们面前的迦南人、赫人、希未人、比利洗人、基迦西亚人、亚摩利人和耶布斯人” (3:10)。这个神迹旨在确认约书亚作为神所拣选的领袖，也要向百姓保证，神必通过约书亚将应许之地赐给他们。

在14至17节，我们看到神为祂的百姓行了一个不可思议的神迹。抬着约柜的祭司们带领百姓向约旦河走去，准备进入应许之地。当他们的脚踏上水面时，河水奇迹般地分开了，水流向两边，圣经在第16节提到，水被堆积在很远的地方。第17节告诉我们，祭司们站在河中央，抬着象征神同在的约柜，神的百姓则在他们的引领下，走过刚才还是汹涌河水的干地。这是来自神自己极为奇妙的神迹！

> [!important]+ 反思与回应
正如神曾为祂的百姓行了惊人的神迹，祂也差派了祂的伟大领袖——耶稣基督，带来了许多神迹。这些神迹指向耶稣，证明祂是神所应许的弥赛亚，祂的生、死和复活应验了许多旧约的预言。你相信这些神迹吗？求神帮助你更清楚地看见耶稣，并使你在祂所赐的赦免、救恩和永恒的祝福中，信心更深。

📖 **Passage to read**: ==Joshua 03==

> [!info]- 🎙️Audio: [A Daily Devotional - 03.12 - EN]()  

Joshua wakes up early in the morning and begins the journey toward the Jordan River. The ark of the covenant, which represents God’s presence with His people, leads the way as the whole community prepares to follow Joshua into the promised land. In verse 7, God speaks to Joshua, giving him an important message: “Today I will begin to exalt you in the sight of all Israel, that they may know that, as I was with Moses, so I will be with you.” God’s purpose in what is about to happen is clear: He wants to show the people that He is with Joshua just as He was with Moses. As the people approach the Jordan River, Joshua explains what will happen next: “Here is how you shall know that the living God is among you and that he will without fail drive out from before you the Canaanites, the Hittites, the Hivites, the Perizzites, the Girgashites, the Amorites, and the Jebusites” (3:10). This sign is meant to confirm Joshua as God’s chosen leader and to assure the people that He will give them the land through Joshua.

In verses 14–17, we read about an incredible miracle that God performs. The priests, carrying the ark of the covenant, are leading the people to the Jordan River as they prepare to enter the land. The moment their feet touch the water, the river is miraculously parted. It splits in two directions, and the text says in verse 16 that the waters are piled up a great distance away. Verse 17 tells us that the priests stand in the middle of the river holding the ark of the covenant, the symbol of God’s presence. While they stand there, the entire Israelite community walks across the dry riverbed where just moments before the river had been flowing. This is an extraordinary, miraculous sign from God Himself!

> [!important]+ Reflect and Respond
Just as God performed incredible signs for His people, He has sent His greatest leader, Jesus Christ, with many signs as well. These signs point to Jesus as the promised Messiah, the One whose life, death, and resurrection fulfill many Old Testament prophecies. Do you believe the signs? Ask God to help you see Jesus more clearly and to deepen your faith in the forgiveness, salvation, and eternal blessing that are found only in Him.
