### Burger Stop - simplified

My family celebrated my youngest sister's 10th birthday recently. We went to a restaurant called Burger Stop for dinner. It is new in our neighborhood.

The restaurant was busy but had a nice atmosphere with colorful tables and chairs. A friendly waiter took our order quickly. We ordered four burgers, fried chicken, potato wedges, and a jug of lemon barley. The service was very fast, and the food came in no time.

The food was mostly very tasty. The burgers were big, with lots of fresh vegetables. The potato wedges were crispy and had a special coating, making them the best we had ever tasted. The fried chicken was crispy on the outside and soft inside.

However, I did not like the sauces. The tomato sauce was too sour, and the cheese sauce tasted plain. The dessert was also disappointing. The ice cream was too soft and melted too quickly, which was not nice for a birthday celebration. Luckily, my sister didn’t mind because she was happy with all the good food!

Overall, we had a great time at Burger Stop. The food was delicious, the service was great, and the prices were fair. Would I tell my friends to try it? Yes, I would!

### Burger Stop - hard

Recently, my family celebrated my youngest sister's tenth birthday. We went to a restaurant called Burger Stop for dinner. It is a new restaurant in our neighborhood. 

The restaurant was very crowded. It had a welcoming atmosphere with colourful tables and chairs. A friendly waiter took our order. We ordered four different burgers, a plate of fried chicken and potato wedges. For drinks, we ordered a jug of lemon barley. Service was fast and efficient. In no time at all, our food arrived.

I like the huge burgers which had generous amounts of vegetables. They were really delicious. The potato wedges had an unusual crunchy coating which was very tasty. We all agreed that those were the best potato wedges we had ever tasted. The fried chicken was crispy and tender.

Although the food was tasty, I did not like the sauces that came with the food. The tomato sauce was too tangy while the cheese sauce was bland. The dessert was disappointing as the ice cream was too soft and melted too quickly. That put a damper on the celebration. Thankfully, the birthday gift did not complain as she was already stuffed with all the good food.

All in all, we had a wonderful time at Burger Stop. The food was delicious, the service was excellent, and the prices were reasonable. Would I recommend this place to my friends? Yes, I would.
