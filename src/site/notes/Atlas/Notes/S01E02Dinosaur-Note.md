[Peppa:] Goodnight, Peppa.

[Mummy Pig:] Goodnight, Mummy.

[Peppa:] Peppa and Daddy Pig are playing draughts.

[Daddy Pig:] Oh, well done, Peppa.

[George:] Whhhhaaaaaaaaaaa.

[Daddy Pig:] George? What's the matter?

[George:] Whaaaaaaaaa.

[Daddy Pig:] George, have you lost Mr. Dinosaur?

[George:] DineDine SawSaw...

[Daddy Pig:] George, what is a detective?

[George:] A detective is a very important person who is good at finding things.

[Peppa:] Me. Me. I'm good at finding things.

[Daddy Pig:] Alright. Peppa is the detective.

[Peppa:] George, I am the detective. I will help you find Mr. Dinosaur.

[Peppa:] Maybe the detective should ask George some simple questions.

[Peppa:] George? Where's Mr. Dinosaur?

[George:] Whaaaaaaaaaa.

[Peppa:] George does not know where Mr. Dinosaur is.

[Peppa:] The detective could try and guess where Mr. Dinosaur might be.

[Peppa:] I know. I know where he is.

[Peppa:] George always has Mr. Dinosaur with him in the bath.

[Peppa:] So Mr. Dinosaur is in the bath.

[George:] Mr. Dinosaur is not in the bath.

[Peppa:] Oh. I know. I know where Mr. Dinosaur is.

[Peppa:] George always has Mr. Dinosaur in his bed at night.

[Peppa:] So that's where he is.

[George:] Mr. Dinosaur is not in George's bed.

[Peppa:] Oh.

[Peppa:] Maybe we should try the garden.

[Daddy Pig:] Yes, the garden.

[Daddy Pig:] I was going to say that.

[Peppa:] Where is Mr. Dinosaur?

[Peppa:] Mr. Dinosaur is very hard to find.

[Peppa:] Oh. Mr. Dinosaur isn't anywhere.

[Peppa:] George? You do love to throw Mr. Dinosaur in the air...

[Peppa:] I wonder if this time you threw Mr. Dinosaur just a bit too high.

[Peppa:] There he is. There he is.

[Peppa:] I saw him first.

[Daddy Pig:] Well done, Peppa. You really are a very good detective.

[George:] DineDine SawSaw.

[George:] Grrrrrrrrrr.

[George:] George is so happy to have Mr. Dinosaur back again.
