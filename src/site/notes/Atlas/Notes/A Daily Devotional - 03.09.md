### <center>应许之地的领袖</center>

> [!info]- 🎙️Audio: [A Daily Devotional - 03.09 - CN]()


那一代叛逆的百姓已经逝去，新的世代准备前行，去夺取神应许给他们的那片土地。这一重要时刻将是圣经下一卷书——《约书亚记》的主题。但在我们进入这卷书之前，让我们先思考《申命记》最后一章中的两个关键事件。

首先，摩西去世。神将他带到一座俯瞰应许之地的山上，向他展示了祂应许赐给祂百姓的土地。然而，摩西自己将无法进入那片土地。尽管摩西曾做过许多伟大的事，但因着他多年前的罪，神的审判依旧有效。摩西，这位伟大的先知和神百姓的领袖，将无法踏足神要赐给祂百姓的那片土地。《申命记》最后一节提醒我们摩西的伟大：“自那时以来，以色列中再没有兴起像摩西这样的人，耶和华和他面对面说话” (34:10)。即使是摩西，这位伟大的人物，也并非完美，他也需要像我们一样的救世主。

其次，约书亚接任。约书亚因摩西按手在他身上，充满了智慧的灵（34:9）。我们见到了神所拣选的领袖，他将带领神的百姓进入应许之地。摩西已经在百姓面前为约书亚委派了领导职分，并鼓励他要刚强壮胆。多年来，约书亚一直是神话语的忠实跟随者，如今他准备好承担起带领神百姓进入这片土地的重大责任。

《申命记》结束时，百姓围绕在约书亚身边，决心跟随他，顺服神的话语。他们有了新的领袖，现在是进入应许之地的时候了。《申命记》的结尾带着对摩西去世的哀伤，但也充满了对新一代神百姓的希望，他们将在约书亚的带领下前行。

> [!important]+ 反思与回应
记住，摩西因自己的罪而遭到神的管教。如果连摩西都如此，那么我们每个人更是需要耶稣基督的救恩。今天花些时间向神认罪，并依靠耶稣基督的赦免。再者，看看百姓对约书亚的回应：他们完全顺服他，正如神和摩西所吩咐的。约书亚，作为指向基督的榜样，理应成为我们追随的领袖。今天祷告，求神帮助你毫不犹豫地顺服并跟随耶稣。

### <center>Leader for the Promised Land</center>

📖 **Passage to read**: ==Deuteronomy 34==

> [!info]- 🎙️Audio: [A Daily Devotional - 03.09 - EN]()  



The generation that rebelled against the Lord has passed away, and now a new generation is ready to move forward and claim the land promised to them. This pivotal moment will be the focus of the next book of the Bible: Joshua. But before we jump into that, let’s take a moment to reflect on two key things that happen in the final chapter of Deuteronomy.

First, Moses dies. God takes him to a mountain that overlooks the promised land and shows him the land He has promised to give to His people. But Moses himself will not enter the land. Despite all the great things Moses did, God’s judgment on his sin years before will stand. Moses, the great prophet and leader of God’s people, will not set foot in the land. The final verse of Deuteronomy makes sure we remember how special Moses was, stating, “Since then, no prophet has risen in Israel like Moses, whom the LORD knew face to face” (34:10). Even Moses, as great as he was, wasn’t perfect. He needed a Savior just like the rest of us. 

Second, Joshua takes over. Joshua is filled with the spirit of wisdom because Moses had laid his hands on him (34:9). Now we meet the man chosen by God to lead His people into the promised land. Moses has already commissioned Joshua in front of the people, encouraging him to be strong and courageous. For years, Joshua has been a faithful follower of God’s word, and now he’s ready to step into the great responsibility of leading God’s people into the land.

As Deuteronomy comes to a close, the people are gathered around Joshua, committed to following him and obeying the word of the Lord. They have a new leader, and it’s time for them to enter the land. The end of Deuteronomy is filled with sadness over Moses’s death but also with hope for the new generation, led by Joshua.

> [!important]+ Reflect and Respond
 Remember, Moses was disciplined by God for his own sin. If that’s true for Moses, how much more do we all need the saving grace of Jesus Christ? Take some time today to confess your sin to God and trust in His forgiveness through Jesus. Also, look at how the people responded to Joshua: they obeyed him completely, just as God and Moses had commanded. Joshua, who points us forward to Christ, the ultimate leader of God’s people, is worthy of our following. Pray today that you would obey and follow Jesus without hesitation.
