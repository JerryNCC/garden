### <center>为牧人和君王而来的君王</center>

> [!info]- 🎙️Audio: [None]()

这真的是君王降临的方式吗？当我们读到这个故事时，心中不禁要这样发问。耶稣的到来，几乎在每一方面都与我们所想像的君王完全不同。先看祂出生的地方和方式。祂的父母因罗马政府下令户口登记而离乡背井，又贫穷无力，竟找不到住宿的地方。伯利恒并没有为弥赛亚铺上欢迎的红毯，也没有任何王者的庆典。路加告诉我们：“马利亚生了头胎的儿子，就用布包起来，放在马槽里，因为客店里没有地方。”（路加福音2:7）救主、君王就这样降生在牲畜之间，被安放在一个喂食的槽中。谁能想像这位统管天地的主竟以这样卑微的方式开始祂的人生？污秽、气味，以及马棚粗陋的环境，围绕着这位真正的君王。

再看第一个听见这好消息的人。不是宫殿里的君王，也不是圣殿里的祭司，而是一群在野地里的牧人。我们也许以为牧人是温和整洁的男子，衣着干净，但事实上并非如此。他们在夜间辛劳工作，为了保护羊群抵御野兽的侵袭。他们是普通的劳工，粗犷疲惫。然而，天上的天使却向这些人显现，宣告弥赛亚降生的福音。路加记载：“忽然有一大队天兵同那天使赞美神说：‘在至高之处荣耀归与神！在地上平安归与他所喜悦的人！’”（路加福音2:13–14）在耶稣的诞生之夜，天军的诗歌并不是向统治者、学者或祭司唱起，而是向这些平凡的牧人宣告。

这段记载告诉我们什么关于耶稣——神的儿子、我们的救主？祂来，是要拯救各族各民。祂不是一个只拥有人间权势的君王，也不是首先寻找尊贵富有的人。祂是为牧人，也为君王而来的君王。从一开始，耶稣就以卑微的救主身份来到世上。祂卑贱的降生早已预示了祂将如何成就救恩——不是坐在世上的宝座上，而是借着十字架完成救赎。

> [!important]+ 反思与回应
祷告求主，使你的心像那些牧人一样回应耶稣，以颂赞和喜乐归荣耀给神。感谢天父差遣祂的儿子，以如此谦卑的方式成为你的救主。

### <center>A King for Shepherds and Princes</center>

> [!question]+ Review
> 1.⁠ ⁠What promises did the angel Gabriel announce to Mary about the child to be born?
2.⁠ ⁠How did Mary respond to the angel’s message, and what does this show about her faith?
3.⁠ ⁠What happened when Mary visited Elizabeth that confirmed God’s work?

📖 **Passage to read**: ==Luke 02.01-21==

> [!info]- 🎙️Audio: [None]()  

Is this really how the King comes? That’s the question we should be asking as we read this story. Almost everything about Jesus’s arrival feels unlike what we would expect for a king. Look first at the place and the way he is born. His parents, poor and far from home because of a government census, cannot even find a room. Bethlehem offers no welcome, no royal celebration. Luke tells us that Mary “gave birth to her firstborn son and wrapped him in swaddling cloths and laid him in a manger, because there was no place for them in the inn” (2:7). The Savior and King is born among animals, resting in a feeding trough. Could there be a beginning less fit for royalty? Dirt, smell, and the rough life of a stable surround the one who rules heaven and earth.

Then notice who first hears the news. Not kings in their palaces. Not priests in the temple. Instead, a group of shepherds out in the fields. We may imagine gentle, handsome men in clean clothes, but shepherds were not so polished. They worked long nights guarding sheep from wild animals. They were ordinary laborers, rough and tired. Yet the angels of heaven appear to them with the good news of the Messiah’s birth. Luke writes, “And suddenly there was with the angel a multitude of the heavenly host praising God and saying, ‘Glory to God in the highest, and on earth peace among those with whom he is pleased!’ ” (2:13–14). At the birth of Jesus, heaven’s choir sings—not to rulers, not to scholars, but to shepherds.

What does this tell us about Jesus, God’s Son and our Savior? It shows that he comes for all kinds of people. He is not a king of political power. He does not first seek the important or the wealthy. He is a king for shepherds and for princes alike. From the very start, Jesus comes as the humble Savior. His lowly birth points ahead to the way he will save—not by taking an earthly throne but by dying on a cross.

> [!important]+ Reflect and Respond
Pray that your heart would answer Jesus as the shepherds did: with praise and joy to God. Thank the Father for sending his Son, who came in such humility to be your Savior.
