### <center>小心而喜乐地顺服神</center>

> [!info]- 🎙️Audio: [A Daily Devotional - 05.29 - CN]()


我们不会在《历代志》上花太多时间，因为它们记录了许多《撒母耳记》中的相同事件。然而，我们将简要地查看这两本书，并稍微回顾一下圣经故事的时间线。

在《历代志上》13章中，关于约柜的运输有着非常不同的情形。那时，大卫负责约柜的运输，但这次的方式并没有按照神的命令进行。按照律法的规定，约柜应该由利未人肩扛，而不是放在一辆车上（参见《历代志上》13:7）。当拉车的牛跌倒时，乌撒伸手去扶约柜，结果神立即惩罚了他，把他打死。这是大卫和以色列百姓的一个悲痛时刻。

到了《历代志上》15章时，大卫已经从之前的错误中吸取了教训。他召集祭司，承认自己的错误，并命令他们按照神通过摩西的命令，正确地把约柜抬在肩上（15:15）。在队伍的行进中，伴随着乐器和利未人的歌声，百姓们一起为神献上喜乐的赞美（15:16–24）。神赐福并保护这次的队伍，百姓们满怀喜悦地前进，并为神献上感谢的祭（15:25–28）。这是神宽恕与恩典的美丽图景，祂恢复了祂的百姓，再次住在他们中间。这也是大卫王从错误中谦卑地学习，并再次决定小心地遵循神的话语的故事。

然而，在这段经文的结尾，我们看到了一丝苦涩的音符：大卫的妻子米该（扫罗的女儿）在心里藐视大卫，看他公开跳舞、敬拜并为神唱赞美歌（15:29）。这提醒我们，并非每个人都会接受我们对神的敬拜。大卫在喜乐中愿意公开地、毫无保留地敬拜他慈爱的神。但对米该来说，这种公开的赞美表现显得愚蠢而令人尴尬。

> [!important]+ 反思与回应
《历代志上》13章教导我们，不小心地顺服神，尤其是在敬拜祂和进入祂圣洁的面前时，会带来危险。但在《历代志上》15章中，我们看到了当我们按神的话语以正确的方式接近神时，所带来的喜乐与恩典。今天，花些时间祷告，求神帮助你以悔改和对祂儿子充满喜乐的信心来接近祂。

### <center>Obeying God Carefully and Joyfully</center>

> [!question]+ Review
> 1. ⁠In 2 Kings 24-25, God uses Babylon’s exile to judge Judah. What does this mean for the people? What lessons does their failure bring to us?
> 2. ⁠Why did King Zedekiah choose to rebel against Babylon, leading to the destruction of Jerusalem? What does his action reflect about his faith attitude?
> 3. What spiritual reflections does the exile bring about God's judgment? How can we avoid repeating Judah's mistakes today and truly submit to God's will?=

📖 **Passage to read**: ==1 Chronicles 15==

> [!info]- 🎙️Audio: [A Daily Devotional - 05.29 - EN]()  

We won’t spend much time in the books of 1 and 2 Chronicles because they repeat many of the events we find in 1 and 2 Samuel. However, we will take a quick look at both books and go a bit backward in the timeline of the Bible.

In 1 Chronicles 13, we find a very different situation regarding the ark of the covenant. At this point, David was overseeing the ark’s transportation, but it was not being done in the way God had commanded. Instead of the ark being carried by the Levites, as the law instructed, it was placed on a cart (1 Chron. 13:7). When the oxen pulling the cart stumbled, Uzzah reached out to steady the ark, and God struck him down on the spot. This was a tragic moment for David and the people of Israel.

By the time we get to 1 Chronicles 15, David has learned from his earlier mistake. He calls the priests, acknowledges his previous error, and orders them to carry the ark of God properly—on their shoulders, with the poles, just as God had commanded through Moses (15:15). Along with the procession, musical instruments and Levitical singers lead the people in joyful praise to God (15:16–24). God blesses and protects the procession. The people move forward in joy and offer sacrifices of thanksgiving to God (15:25–28). This is a beautiful picture of God’s forgiveness and grace as He restores His people and once again dwells among them. It’s also a picture of King David humbly learning from his mistakes and choosing to obey God’s word carefully.

However, there is a bitter note at the end of the passage: Michal, David’s wife and the daughter of King Saul, despises him “in her heart” as she watches him worshiping, dancing, and praising God publicly (15:29). This reminds us that not everyone will embrace our worship of God. David, in his joy, is willing to worship his gracious God publicly, with abandon. But to Michal, in her bitterness, this public display of praise seems foolish and embarrassing.

> [!important]+ Reflect and Respond
1 Chronicles 13 teaches us the danger of failing to obey God carefully, especially when it comes to how we worship Him and approach His holy presence. But in 1 Chronicles 15, we see the joy and grace that comes when we approach God in the right way, according to His word. Today, take time to pray, asking God to help you come to Him in repentance and joyful faith in His Son.
