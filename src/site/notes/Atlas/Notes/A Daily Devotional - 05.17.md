> [!question]+ 回顾昨天的内容
> 1. 以利亚经历了极大的属灵胜利之后，却陷入极深的沮丧和逃亡中。这提醒我们在属灵高峰之后可能会遇到哪些挑战？你是否有类似的经历？
> 2. 神并没有立刻改变以利亚的处境，而是用食物、天使、和“微小的声音”来安慰他。我们能从神对以利亚的回应中学到什么关于祂的性情和带领？
> 3. 在我们无法理解神计划的时候，你通常如何回应？你是否愿意学习像以利亚一样，在低谷中也信靠神的同在与话语？

### <center>神极大的怜悯</center>

> [!info]- 🎙️Audio: [A Daily Devotional - 05.17 - CN]()

你可能曾听人说过：“旧约中的神是愤怒和审判的神，而新约中的神才是慈爱与怜悯的神。”这听起来好像很有道理，但其实根本站不住脚。圣经给出的图画完全不同——神从未改变。祂一直都是既公义又充满怜悯的神。《列王纪上》第21章正是一个极佳的例子。

以色列王亚哈看中了一块葡萄园，那是拿伯的产业。当拿伯拒绝卖给他——因为那是他祖传的土地，在以色列律法中具有神圣意义——亚哈就像个小孩子一样闷闷不乐、闹情绪。他的妻子耶洗别比他更邪恶、更狡诈。她策划了一场阴谋，要替亚哈拿到那块地。她找来几名匪类，在公众面前诬告拿伯，说他亵渎神、辱骂王。结果，拿伯被人拖出城外，用石头打死了。

神看见了这一切，祂的怒气也随之燃起。于是祂差遣先知以利亚去找亚哈，带去神的信息。以利亚宣告了严厉的审判：因亚哈所犯的罪，他的家将被铲除，连他和耶洗别都将死于非命，尸体被狗舔舐。

但这时，令人震惊的事情发生了。亚哈竟然有所回应。他撕裂衣服，禁食哀痛，在人前显示出懊悔的姿态。更令人惊奇的是：神看见了。祂吩咐以利亚，说因为亚哈在祂面前自卑，祂就不在亚哈在位的日子施行这场灾难，而是延后。

亚哈的悔改是否真实、长久？或许不是。看起来更像是一种出于恐惧的短暂反应。然而，即便如此，神仍向他施恩。

> [!important]+ 反思与回应
这正是神的本性——祂向罪人伸出悔改、饶恕与更新的机会。这也是十字架的荣耀：耶稣在那里为我们的罪付上代价，开了一条通往赦免的道路。所以今天，请你花一点时间，感恩神向你所施的怜悯，并求祂赐你一颗真实悔改的心，好使你每日都能顺服祂、与祂同行。

### <center>God’s Great Mercy</center>

> [!question]+ Review
> 1. After a great spiritual victory, Elijah quickly fell into deep discouragement and had to flee for his life. What challenges can often follow spiritual highs? Have you experienced something similar?
> 2. God didn’t immediately change Elijah’s situation, but instead comforted him through food, an angel, and a “gentle whisper.” What can we learn about God's character and guidance from the way He responded to Elijah?
> 3. When you don’t understand God’s plans, how do you usually respond? Are you willing to trust His presence and His Word even when things seem uncertain, like Elijah did?

📖 **Passage to read**: ==1 Kings 19==

> [!info]- 🎙️Audio: [A Daily Devotional - 05.17 - EN]()  

You’ve probably heard someone say something like this before: the God of the Old Testament is all about anger and judgment, while the God of the New Testament is full of love and mercy. That kind of thinking sounds neat, but it just doesn’t hold up. The Bible tells a different story. God doesn’t change. He’s always been both just and merciful. And 1 Kings 21 is a great example of this.

King Ahab of Israel wanted a vineyard. It belonged to a man named Naboth, and Naboth wouldn’t sell it. The vineyard was part of his family’s inheritance, and in Israel, that meant something. Ahab didn’t take it well. He sulked like a child who didn’t get his way. His wife, Jezebel, was even worse. She made a plan to get the vineyard for Ahab. She had Naboth accused by a couple of dishonest men in a public trial. They lied and said he had cursed God and the king. Because of those lies, Naboth was taken outside and killed.

God saw what happened, and He was angry. He sent Elijah, the prophet, to Ahab with a message. Elijah told him that judgment was coming. Because of his sin, Ahab’s house would fall, and both he and Jezebel would die violent deaths. It was a heavy word from God.

But then, something surprising happened. Ahab actually responded. He tore his clothes, fasted, and walked around in sorrow. He showed signs of real grief. And here’s the amazing part: God noticed. He told Elijah that because Ahab had humbled himself, the full punishment wouldn’t come during Ahab’s lifetime. It would come later.

Was Ahab’s repentance deep and lasting? Probably not. It looks like a short-term response to being afraid. But still, God showed mercy. Even to Ahab.

> [!important]+ Reflect and Respond
This is who God is. He gives people a chance to turn from their sin, to find forgiveness, and to walk in a new direction. That’s what Jesus accomplished on the cross—He opened the way for people like us to be forgiven. So today, take a moment to thank God for His mercy. Ask Him to help you turn from sin in a way that lasts. And keep walking with Him, one step at a time, in obedience and trust.
