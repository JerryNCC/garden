### <center>与神争斗</center>

> [!info]- 🎙️Audio: [A Daily Devotional - 01.23 - CN]()

对我们许多人来说，第一次悔改并信靠耶稣基督的那一天是一个决定性的时刻。那一天标志着我们生命的真正转折点。今天的经文也为雅各带来了一个类似的转折点。自从创世记32章之后，雅各的生活，以及神的子民的命运，都发生了变化。对于雅各来说，这个转折点并不意外，因为这一切的改变是通过一场激烈的争斗来实现的。

雅各与拉班在一起多年，辛勤工作，逐渐变得富有和强大。神也通过他的两个妻子，拉结和利亚，赐给他许多儿女。然而，即便有了这些祝福，雅各的家庭生活依旧充满了纷争。拉结与利亚在争夺丈夫的爱时，几乎把生育变成了一场竞争。一个生了孩子，另一个就赶紧也要生一个，两人甚至劝说雅各与她们的使女生子，以超越对方。尽管家中纷争不断，我们却依然能清楚地看到，神对雅各的祝福从未停歇，尽管这个“抓住者”一生都在与神争斗。

在创世记32章22节，雅各正准备与哥哥以扫见面，心中惶恐不安，担心哥哥会为过去的错误报复自己。天色将晚，雅各让其他人先行，自己独自留下。接着，一件奇怪的事情发生了：“一个人和他摔跤”（32:24）。这场神秘的较量一直持续到天亮，直到那人终于放开雅各，留下一个终生的伤痛——一个跛脚，使他一生都带着这个伤痕。

雅各坚决不放开那人，直到他得到了祝福。接着，雅各宣称自己亲眼见到了神的面。那个与雅各摔跤的人，实际上是神自己，以人的形象显现给他。这场争斗，虽然只持续了一个晚上，却象征着雅各一生与神的挣扎。然而，到了夜晚的尽头，雅各的心态发生了变化。他终于意识到自己多么需要神的祝福，并恳求神赐福于他。神一直打算要祝福他，也的确如愿地祝福了他，并赐给他一个新名字——以色列，意思是“与神争斗”。

> [!important]+ 反思与回应
今天，你是否也在与神争斗？你与神的关系是否充满挣扎？创世记中的信息对我们来说与对以色列人是一样的：放下吧，承认你对神的需要，并单单依靠祂的祝福。今天就做吧！接受神的终极祝福，那个祝福唯有通过信靠、爱慕并跟随耶稣基督才能得到。

### <center>Struggling with God</center>

> [!question]+ Review
> 1. What kind of deception did Jacob experience in the story? How did he react?
> 2. How does God continue to fulfill His promises through Jacob's experiences?
> 3. How do you view God’s work in Jacob's life, and how does it compare to the lives of believers today?

📖 **Passage to read**: ==Genesis 32==

> [!info]- 🎙️Audio: [A Daily Devotional - 01.23 - EN]()


For many of us, the day we first repented of our sins and placed our trust in Jesus Christ was a defining moment. It marked a real turning point in our lives. In today's passage, we witness a similar turning point for Jacob. After Genesis 32, everything changes for him—and for God’s people. It’s not surprising that this change comes through a struggle.

Jacob had spent many years working with Laban, becoming wealthy and powerful. God had also blessed him with children through his two wives, Rachel and Leah. But even with all these blessings, Jacob's family life was far from peaceful. Rachel and Leah were constantly competing for their husband’s love, turning childbearing into a rivalry. Each time one had a child, the other would quickly try to have one, and both even persuaded Jacob to father children with their servant women to outdo each other. Despite all the turmoil, we can clearly see that God was still determined to bless Jacob, even though this “grabber” had spent his life struggling with God.

In verse 22, Jacob is about to meet his brother Esau, terrified of what might happen as a result of his past wrongs. As night falls, Jacob sends everyone else ahead and stays behind, alone. Then something strange happens: "A man wrestled with him" (32:24). This mysterious fight continues through the night until morning, when the man finally lets go of Jacob, leaving him with a lasting injury—a limp that will stay with him for the rest of his life.

Jacob refuses to let the man go until he is blessed. He then declares that he has seen God face to face. The man who wrestled with Jacob was God himself, appearing in human form. This struggle, lasting just one night, symbolized the ongoing battle Jacob had fought with God throughout his life. But by the end of the night, something in Jacob changed. He realized how much he needed God’s blessing and begged for it. And God, who had always intended to bless him, did just that. He gave Jacob a new name, Israel, which means “strives with God.”

> [!important]+ Reflect and Respond
Are you wrestling with God today? Is your relationship with Him a struggle? The message in Genesis is the same for us as it was for the Jewish people: let go, acknowledge your need for God, and turn to Him alone for blessing. Do this today! Accept His ultimate blessing, which comes only through trusting, loving, and following Jesus Christ.
