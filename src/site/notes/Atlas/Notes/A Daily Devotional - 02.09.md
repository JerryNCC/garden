### <center>指向完美的大祭司</center>

> [!info]- 🎙️Audio: [A Daily Devotional - 02.09 - CN]()

上帝已经选择以色列人作为祂的特别子民。接着，祂赐给他们律法，不仅仅是一些规则，而是作为一种引导，帮助他们作为一个敬拜祂的群体来生活。当你继续阅读圣经时，记得上帝赐给律法是极大的恩典。祂本不必给他们任何指导，但祂这么做了，是为了让他们能够与这位圣洁的上帝亲近生活。律法的目的是教导他们祂的圣洁。

然而，在出埃及记32章，发生了一件可怕的事情。摩西仍然在山上，代表百姓从上帝那里接受律法。可是，百姓变得不耐烦了。他们厌倦了等待摩西，厌倦了跟随一位看不见的上帝。所以他们说服亚伦——摩西的哥哥和祭司——用他们离开埃及时从埃及人那里得到的金饰，造出一个金牛犊。接着，他们举行了盛大的庆典，围着这个金牛犊跳舞唱歌，开始敬拜它。

以色列人渴望能够看得见、摸得着的东西，渴望有一件可以敬拜的实体。他们厌倦了跟随那位看不见的上帝——那位通过祂的话语来治理他们的上帝。

然而，接下来发生了一些重要的事情。首先，在出埃及记32章25至29节，我们看到一些参与偶像崇拜的百姓立刻受到审判。这教给我们一个重要的教训：上帝的圣洁比人的生命更重要。其次，我们看到亚伦作为祭司失败了——他本应领导百姓敬拜，并在上帝和百姓之间充当中保。亚伦的失败表明，百姓需要一位更好的祭司。最后，摩西在百姓中间担任了一个重要的中保角色。他甚至愿意为他们的罪献上自己的生命，作为赎罪的代价。虽然上帝没有接受摩西的提议，但这一幕却指向了一个日子，那时上帝会接受祂的儿子提出的类似请求。

> [!important]+ 反思与回应
今天，祈求上帝帮助你单单敬拜祂，不去崇拜你心中的偶像。感谢祂赐给你一位完美的大祭司——祂的儿子，祂为你献出了生命，使你不必因你所犯的罪和偶像崇拜而面对审判。

### <center>Pointing Toward the Perfect Priest</center>

> [!question]+ Review
> 1.⁠ ⁠How is God's holiness shown in Exodus 24? Why is His holiness unbearable?
> 2.⁠ ⁠How did the Israelites respond to God's word? What lesson does this response offer to believers today?
> 3.⁠ ⁠How is God's grace revealed in this passage? How should we respond to God's grace in our lives?

📖 **Passage to read**: ==Exodus 24==

> [!info]- 🎙️Audio: [A Daily Devotional - 02.09 - EN]()  


God had already chosen the Israelites as His special people. Then, He gave them the law, not just as rules, but as a guide to help them live as a community that worships Him. As you continue reading through the Bible, remember that God’s giving of the law is a great act of grace. He didn’t have to give them any guidelines, but He did so they could live in close relationship with Him, a holy God. The law was meant to teach them about His holiness.

But in Exodus 32, something awful happens. Moses is still up on the mountain, receiving the law from God on behalf of the people. The people, however, grow impatient. They get tired of waiting for Moses and weary of following a God they cannot see. So they convince Aaron, Moses’s brother and the priest, to make a golden calf for them using the jewelry they had taken from the Egyptians when they left. Then they throw a big party and begin to worship the calf, dancing and singing around it.

The people of Israel wanted something they could see and touch, something physical to worship. They grew tired of following a God they couldn’t see, a God who ruled them through His word.

But then, we see some important things happen. First, in Exodus 32:25–29, we see immediate judgment on some of the people who were involved in the idolatry. This teaches us a key lesson: God’s holiness matters more than human life. Second, we see Aaron fail as a priest—the one who should have led the people in worship and served as a mediator between them and God. Aaron proves that the people need a better priest. Third, Moses steps into a mediating role for the people. He even offers to give his own life to atone for their sin. Although God doesn’t accept Moses’s offer, this moment points us to a day when God will accept a similar offer from His Son.

> [!important]+ Reflect and Respond
Pray today, asking God to help you worship Him alone, not the idols of your heart. Thank Him for providing you with a perfect priest—His Son—who gave His life so you wouldn’t have to face the judgment for your sin and idolatry.
