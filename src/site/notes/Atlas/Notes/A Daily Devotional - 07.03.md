### <center>雅各的　神是我们的避难所</center>

> [!info]- 🎙️Audio: [A Daily Devotional - 07.03 - CN]()

大多数诗篇是向　神发出的个人祷告，但诗篇第46篇却有些不同。这是一首为　神的子民而写的诗歌，不只是为个人。这篇诗不是出自大卫之手，而是可拉的后裔所作——他们很可能是以色列的敬拜领袖。这首诗传达的信息简单有力：神是信实的。祂是所有投靠祂之人的避难所。

诗篇开篇便点出了核心主题：“神是我们的避难所，是我们的力量，是我们在患难中随时的帮助。”（诗46:1）请想象一座坚固的高台或堡垒，这就是神对祂百姓的样式。即使堡垒之外的世界正在崩塌，神仍是我们安全的所在。首先是自然界的动荡。即便地震山摇、群山坠入大海、水浪翻腾咆哮，神的百姓也无需惧怕（诗46:2-3），因为祂比受造物中最坚固的山更坚稳。

接着是列国的动荡。正如自然会震动，列国与君王也会动荡不安。“列国喧嚷，列邦动摇”（诗46:6），但这一切对　神毫无威胁。祂只发声，大地就消融。神不仅胜过自然——祂是创造者；祂也掌管列国，因为祂是万国之主。

整篇诗篇不断强调一个核心主题：无论外在多么混乱不安，神都保守祂的子民得以稳固安然。祂是那永不动摇的磐石，是我们最稳妥的根基。

这篇诗还有另一个信息：有一天，世上所有的喧嚣与动乱都将止息。神必带来和平。“祂止息刀兵，直到地极。”（诗46:9）紧接着，诗中传出神自己的声音：“你们要休息，要知道我是　神。”（诗46:10）这不仅是温柔的邀请，更是对列国的命令：住口吧！安静吧！因为我是神，我掌权。

> [!important]+ 反思与回应
所以，今天请你记得：神是你的避难所，是你平安的源头。向祂祷告，求祂赐你更多的信心，信靠祂。祂创造了你，也差祂的儿子为你舍命。无论环境如何动荡，你都可以在祂里面安歇。

### <center>The God of Jacob Is Our Fortress</center>

> [!question]+ Review
> 1. ⁠How does David describe God as his Shepherd in Psalm 23? What does this teach you about God's care?
> 2. Why is David able to feel peace and abundance even in the presence of his enemies? What does God's banquet imagery mean for believers?
> 3. Do you only know facts about God, or do you walk in a real relationship with Him? What practical steps can you take to grow closer to your Shepherd?

📖 **Passage to read**: ==Psalm 46==

> [!info]- 🎙️Audio: [A Daily Devotional - 07.03 - EN]()  

Most psalms are personal prayers to God, but Psalm 46 is a little different. It’s a song, not just for an individual, but for all of God’s people. It isn’t written by David either. This psalm comes from the sons of Korah, who likely served as worship leaders for Israel. Their message is simple and strong: God is faithful. He is a safe place for those who trust in him.

The heart of the psalm is found right at the start: “God is our refuge and strength, a very present help in trouble” (46:1). Picture a strong tower or fortress. That’s what God is like for his people. Around that fortress, though, the world is falling apart. First, there’s the chaos of nature. Even if the earth shakes, the mountains fall into the sea, and the waters roar and churn, God’s people don’t need to fear (46:2–3). He is stronger and more steady than anything in creation.

Then there’s the chaos of nations. Just like nature can rage and shake, so can nations and rulers. “The nations rage, the kingdoms totter” (46:6). But God isn’t threatened by any of this. He just speaks, and the earth melts away. God is not only stronger than nature—he made it. And he rules over every king and every land.

All throughout the psalm, one main theme comes through clearly: God keeps his people secure. Even when everything around us is shaking and unsure, God is firm. He is a rock that won’t move.

But there’s another truth here too: one day, all the noise and rage of this world will stop. God will bring peace. He “makes wars cease to the end of the earth” (46:9). And then we hear God speak: “Be still, and know that I am God” (46:10). It’s not just a gentle invitation—it’s a command to the nations. God says, “Stop. Be quiet. I am God. I am in charge.”

> [!important]+ Reflect and Respond
So today, remember this: God is your fortress. He is your safety and peace. Talk to him. Ask him to help you trust him more. He made you, and he gave his Son to save you. You can rest in him, no matter what happens around you.
