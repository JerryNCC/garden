> [!question]+ 回顾昨天的内容
> 1.⁠ ⁠在耶利米书第十八章中，上帝借着陶匠与泥土的比喻传达了什么信息？这对我们认识上帝的主权有何帮助？
2.⁠ ⁠当泥土顺服陶匠的手时，会发生什么？上帝对愿意悔改的子民有何应许？
3.⁠ ⁠你是否也曾像以色列民一样，坚持“照自己的计谋去行”？今天你可以如何在生活中更信靠并顺服这位陶匠？

### <center>新约</center>

> [!info]- 🎙️Audio: [None]()

胶带是个好工具。你可以用它修补很多东西——坏掉的玩具、松动的运动器材，甚至家里的工具。但有时候，胶带还不够。有些东西已经破碎得无法挽救，需要更强而有效的解决办法。耶利米在第三十一章中所说的，就是这种解决之道。

耶利米预见有一天，一切将被真正修复——不是暂时缝补、勉强维系，而是完全、永久的医治。上帝在因罪责备祂子民之后，将带来全新的作为。祂要彻底对付罪，不再是表面的补救，而是一个全新的起点。

耶利米称这全新的起点为“新约”。这约类似于上帝从前与亚伯拉罕所立的约，但将带来更深远的改变。那时，上帝的律法不再只是外在的命令，而是刻在祂子民的心版上。百姓无需彼此提醒该如何认识上帝，因为他们都必认识祂，从最小的到至大的都一样。而至于罪？上帝说祂要完全赦免，不再记念他们的罪孽。再没有悖逆与偏离，祂的百姓将永远属祂。

在耶利米之后的很长一段时间里，人们几乎听不见“新约”的声音。但有一天，在一个寂静的屋子里，耶稣与祂的门徒一同坐席时，再次提到这个约。祂举起一杯酒，说这是“用〔祂〕血所立的新约”（路加福音22:20）。耶稣即将上十字架，祂的宝血将成为赦罪的祭，是彻底胜过罪与死的牺牲。

> [!important]+ 反思与回应
这就是新约的核心——耶稣自己。每天，我们都需要回到这个真理。耶稣的宝血——祂的舍命，是我们蒙赦免、得救恩，与神亲近的根基。我们不是靠自己的力量或善行站在神面前，而是单单因耶稣的成就。这应许是确实的，不是用墨写成的，而是用神儿子的宝血写成的。

### <center>New Covenant</center>

> [!question]+ Review
> 1.⁠ ⁠In Jeremiah 18, what message does God convey through the image of the potter and the clay? How does this help us understand God’s sovereignty?
2.⁠ ⁠What happens when the clay yields to the hands of the potter? What does God promise to those who repent and turn back to Him?
3.⁠ ⁠Have you ever, like the Israelites, chosen to follow your own plans? How can you trust and submit more deeply to the Potter in your life today?

📖 **Passage to read**: ==Jeremiah 31.31040==

Duct tape is a great tool. You can fix a lot of things with it—broken toys, loose parts on sports gear, even household tools. But sometimes, duct tape isn’t enough. Some things are just too broken. You need something stronger, something that lasts. That’s the kind of solution Jeremiah talks about in chapter 31.

Jeremiah sees a day coming when things will be truly fixed—not patched up, not temporarily held together, but completely and permanently healed. God, after disciplining his people for their sin, will bring about something new. He will deal with sin once and for all. His people won’t just get a quick fix. They’ll get a new beginning.

Jeremiah calls this new beginning a “new covenant.” It’s going to be like the covenant God made long ago with Abraham, but with a deeper effect. Instead of just hearing God’s law, people will have it written on their hearts. God’s people won’t have to keep reminding each other about who God is and what he wants—because they’ll all know him, from the least to the greatest. And sin? God says he’ll forgive it completely. He will not remember their sins anymore. There won’t be any more rebellion or wandering away. His people will be his forever.

For a long time after Jeremiah, you don’t hear much about this “new covenant.” But then, in a quiet room with his disciples, Jesus brings it up again. He holds a cup of wine and tells them it represents the “new covenant in \[his] blood” (Luke 22:20). Jesus is about to go to the cross. His blood will be the sacrifice that brings full forgiveness. His death will be the lasting solution to sin and death.

> [!important]+ Reflect and Respond
That’s the heart of the new covenant: Jesus himself. Every day, we need to come back to this truth. Jesus’ blood—his sacrifice—is the foundation of our forgiveness, our salvation, and our life with God. We don’t stand before God by our strength or goodness, but by what Jesus has done. This promise is sure, and it’s written not in ink, but in blood—the blood of the Son of God.
