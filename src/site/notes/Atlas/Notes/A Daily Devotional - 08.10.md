百姓无视耶利米的警告——也拒绝倾听其他先知的劝勉。他们顽固不悔改，如今上帝的审判临到这悖逆、犯罪的子民。然而，即便在这幽暗的篇章中，仍可见一丝微光的盼望。

《耶利米书》第五十二章一开始，犹大王西底家背叛当时的强国——巴比伦。巴比伦王立刻作出迅猛而严厉的回应，大军围困耶路撒冷，攻陷城池，占据全境。西底家被擒，被迫亲眼目睹儿子们被杀，然后双目被剜，锁链捆绑，押往巴比伦为奴。

在这入侵之中，最令人心碎的事发生了：上帝的圣殿被毁。那原是上帝百姓敬拜之所，如今却被不敬畏上帝的外邦人掳掠。圣殿被火焚烧，敬拜所用的圣物尽被掠走。

接着，成千上万的上帝子民被掳到巴比伦，强行迁离那昔日上帝所赐的应许之地。当《耶利米书》接近尾声时，故事似乎提出了一个沉痛的问题：上帝的国将会怎样？上帝已降下审判，借着邪恶之国将祂的百姓赶出那地。然而，上帝的统治呢？祂对亚伯拉罕、以撒、大卫的应许又将如何成就？

最后几节经文带来了细微却真实的盼望。尽管上帝的百姓远离家园，但祂的王权并未终止。在被掳的第三十七年，巴比伦王出人意料地善待犹大王约雅斤，赐他在自己席上同坐，并保全他的性命。上帝仍在保守大卫的后裔，因为祂曾应许大卫必有一位“永远的君王”从他而出。这位君王在此时尚未来临。

> [!important]+ 反思与回应
因此，要向上帝承认你曾轻看自己的罪；求祂使你看见自己深切需要祂与祂的恩典。随后，当称颂祂那完美的计划——这计划在大卫的伟大子孙降临时达到顶峰；祂就是那位最终解决罪恶、被掳与悖逆的救主。

📖 **Passage to read**: ==Jeremiah 52==

> [!info]- 🎙️Audio: [None]()  

The people have ignored Jeremiah’s words—and the words of other prophets as well. They have refused to repent. Now, God’s judgment finally comes on his stubborn, sinful people. But even in this dark chapter, there is still a small light of hope.

Jeremiah 52 opens with King Zedekiah of Judah rebelling against Babylon, the great empire of the day. The Babylonian king responds quickly and fiercely. His army surrounds Jerusalem, captures it, and takes control. Zedekiah is caught. He is forced to watch his sons killed before his eyes are put out. Then he is taken away in chains to Babylon.

During this invasion, the worst possible thing happens: the temple of God is destroyed. The holy place, where God’s people came to worship him, is plundered by unbelieving pagans. The temple is burned to the ground, and the sacred objects used for worship are carried away as loot.

Then, thousands of God’s people are taken into exile in Babylon. They are forced to leave the land God gave them long ago. The story seems to raise a painful question as the book of Jeremiah closes: What will happen to God’s kingdom? God has sent judgment. He has used a wicked nation to remove his people from the land. But what about God’s rule? What about his promises to Abraham, Isaac, and David?

The final verses offer a small but sure hope. God’s people are far from home, yet his rule has not ended. In the thirty-seventh year of the exile, the king of Babylon unexpectedly treats King Jehoiachin of Judah with kindness. He gives him a seat at his own table and spares his life. God is still protecting the line of David. And God had promised David a “forever King” from his descendants. That King is still to come in the story.

> [!important]+ Reflect and Respond
So, confess to God the ways you have taken your sin lightly. Ask him to show you how deeply you need him and his grace. Then praise him for his perfect plan—a plan that reaches its high point in the coming of the great Son of David, who will bring the final answer to sin, exile, and rebellion.
