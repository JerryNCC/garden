### <center>伟大领袖的罪</center>

> [!info]- 🎙️Audio: [A Daily Devotional - 02.25 - CN]()

在探子带回报告后的叛乱之后，神应许当前的以色列成人一代无法进入应许之地。他们将在旷野中漂流多年，直到这一代人全部死去。本章提醒我们，即使是神的百姓领袖，也同样是罪人，他们不配进入应许之地。

章节的开头和结尾，我们看到米利暗和亚伦的死。米利暗的死提到得很简短，但在亚伦去世之前，神提醒摩西，亚伦曾背叛过主。亚伦曾不止一次地犯错，包括他在制造金牛犊时的角色，以及与米利暗一起反对摩西的领导。这两位领导者——摩西的亲兄妹——和其他所有以色列人一样，都是在神面前有罪的。米利暗和亚伦，与百姓一同，无法进入应许之地。

我们曾看到摩西被描述为神拣选的忠心领袖，他是那个曾被百姓抱怨的人，他们因抱怨他而受到审判。然而令人遗憾的是，即便摩西本人也不配进入应许之地。第2到13节的内容可能令人困惑。百姓因口渴向摩西和亚伦抱怨，这一点是清楚的。但当神指示摩西从磐石中为百姓取水时，摩西确实照办了。然而，神的回应却并不积极。

那神为何不悦呢？是因为摩西在第10节中说话的方式，让人觉得是他和亚伦为百姓带来了水（“我们为你们从磐石中取水吗……”）？还是因为摩西打了磐石，而不是照着神的吩咐与磐石说话？很可能两者都有。我们知道的是，神看到摩西并没有完全信靠祂，也没有在百姓面前将祂视为圣洁。摩西让骄傲战胜了他，未能让神显得至圣，反而将一些荣耀归于自己。因此，摩西——这位伟大的神的百姓领袖——和其他以色列人一样，接受了同样的惩罚：他将无法进入应许之地。

> [!important]+ 反思与回应
《民数记》20章教导我们，把希望寄托在任何一个凡人领袖身上，都是错误的。你是否曾将你所有的希望寄托在某个人身上？让这段经文提醒你，唯有耶稣才是真正值得我们崇拜、献身和赞美的。求神帮助你每天都将耶稣作为你唯一的祭司和领袖，坚定依靠祂。

### <center>The Sin of a Great Leader</center>

> [!question]+ Review
> 1.⁠ ⁠Why did Moses and Aaron repeatedly fall on their faces before God? What does this reflect about their attitude toward the people?
> 2.⁠ ⁠What was the reason for Korah and his followers' rebellion? Why couldn't they accept Moses and Aaron as God's chosen leaders?
> 3.⁠ ⁠Why did God judge Moses and Aaron? What lesson can we learn from this judgment?

📖 **Passage to read**: ==Numbers 20==

> [!info]- 🎙️Audio: [A Daily Devotional - 02.25 - EN]()  

After the people’s rebellion when the spies returned with their report, God promised that the current generation of Israelite adults would not enter the promised land. They would spend many years wandering in the wilderness until that generation passed away. This chapter reminds us that even leaders of God’s people are sinners and do not deserve to enter the promised land.

At the start and end of the chapter, we read about the deaths of Miriam and Aaron. Miriam’s death is mentioned briefly, but before Aaron dies, God reminds Moses that Aaron had rebelled against the Lord. Aaron had done this more than once, including his role in creating the golden calf and in opposing Moses’ leadership with Miriam. These two leaders—Moses’ own brother and sister—are guilty before God, along with the rest of Israel. Miriam and Aaron, like the rest of the people, will not enter the promised land.

We have seen Moses described as God’s chosen and faithful leader. He was the one whom the people grumbled against, and they were judged for their complaints against him. But sadly, even Moses himself is not worthy of entering the promised land. What happens in verses 2–13 can be confusing. The people complain to Moses and Aaron because they are thirsty and want water—that part is clear. But when God tells Moses to bring water from the rock, Moses does just that. Still, God’s response is not favorable.

Why is God upset? Is it because Moses spoke as if he and Aaron were the ones bringing the water (“Shall we bring water for you…”) in verse 10? Or is it because Moses struck the rock instead of speaking to it? Probably both. What we do know is that God sees that Moses did not trust Him fully or honor Him as holy in front of the people. Moses allowed his pride to get the best of him, and instead of making sure God was shown as holy, he took some of the credit. As a result, Moses—this great leader of God’s people—receives the same punishment as the rest of the Israelites: he will not enter the promised land.

> [!important]+ Reflect and Respond
Numbers 20 teaches us that putting our hope in any mere human leader is misguided. Do you ever place your ultimate hope in people? Let this passage remind you that only Jesus is truly worthy of our worship, devotion, and praise. Ask God to help you trust in Jesus, your priest and leader, every single day.
