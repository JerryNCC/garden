### <center>放纵犯罪的许可？</center>

> [!info]- 🎙️Audio: [None]()


请你想一想，在你生命中，有一个你深深爱着的人——也许是家人，也许是挚友。若有一天，你在某件事上深深地伤害了他。后来，当你回到他面前道歉时，他却带着温柔的笑容对你说：“我爱你，我原谅你。”——这样的饶恕，会让你想再一次伤害他吗？当然不会！真正的饶恕，会触动人的心，使人感恩，更激发出愿意去爱、去珍惜对方的心。

然而，使徒保罗的反对者却提出了一个奇怪的论调：既然保罗宣讲的是恩典与赦免的信息，难道这不会让人更加放纵犯罪吗？他们似乎在说：“如果神总是宽恕，那我们岂不越犯罪越能显出祂的恩典吗？”

保罗直接回应了这个质疑：“我们可以仍在罪中，好叫恩典增多吗？”（罗6:1）他的回答十分坚决——“断乎不可！”（罗6:2）在保罗看来，福音绝不可能引导人继续犯罪。恰恰相反，真正信靠耶稣的人，已经“向罪死了”。

信靠基督，意味着与祂同死、也与祂一同复活。当神的灵使我们信靠基督时，我们那旧有、被罪辖制的生命，就与基督一同钉在十字架上——永不再复活。恩典不是一张“免罪通行证”；真正经历神恩典的人，生命会被彻底更新。

有时，我们可能会把十字架当作一种“属灵保险”，以为只要有耶稣的赦免，就可以继续我行我素。但那不是圣经中的恩典。神在基督里的恩典，并不是纵容我们犯罪，而是释放我们脱离罪的奴役。若有任何“福音”让人对罪感到心安理得，那就不是真福音，而是廉价的恩典——与那在十字架上为我们付出极重代价的恩典毫无关系。

> [!important]+ 反思与回应
若你曾轻看过神的恩典，求祂赦免你。思想每一项罪都需要基督的宝血偿还。求圣灵赐你力量，使你真正活出那“向罪已死”的生命——不再为罪而活，而是为那位为你舍命的救主而活。

### <center>A License to Sin?</center>

> [!question]+ Review
> 


📖 **Passage to read**: ==Romans 06==

> [!info]- 🎙️Audio: [None]()  


Think for a moment about someone you deeply love—a family member or a close friend. Now imagine that you have hurt this person badly. Later, when you come back to apologize, that person looks at you kindly and says, “I love you, and I forgive you.” Would that kind of forgiveness make you want to hurt that person again? Of course not! True forgiveness moves the heart. It makes you thankful, and it makes you want to love that person even more.

But some of Paul’s critics didn’t see it that way. They thought that his message of grace and forgiveness would make people careless about sin. “If God forgives us freely,” they said, “won’t that just encourage us to sin more?”

Paul raises that question directly: “Are we to continue in sin that grace may abound?” (Romans 6:1). And his reply is strong: “By no means!” (6:2). For Paul, it is impossible to think that the gospel of grace would lead anyone deeper into sin. The truth is just the opposite. When we put our faith in Christ, something radical happens—we die to sin.

To trust in Jesus means to share both in his death and in his resurrection. When God gives us faith, our old, sinful self is put to death with Jesus on the cross—once and for all. Grace doesn’t give us permission to sin; it gives us power to live free from sin’s control. God’s grace changes who we are at the deepest level.

Sometimes we may treat the cross as if it were a kind of safety net—a place we can fall back on while we keep doing what we want. But that’s not what grace is for. God’s grace in Christ doesn’t protect us while we keep sinning; it sets us free so that we can live for him. Any message that makes people feel more comfortable with sin is not the gospel at all. It’s cheap grace, not the costly grace that came through the blood of God’s own Son.

> [!important]+ Reflect and Respond
If you have ever treated God’s grace lightly, ask him to forgive you. Remember that every sin was paid for by Jesus’ death on the cross. Pray that God’s Spirit will give you strength to live as someone who truly has died to sin and now walks in the new life of Christ.
