在恳切祷告求神赐手与耶路撒冷及其破败城墙同在之后，尼希米意识到自己正是神为这关键时刻所拣选的人。让我们简要地看三点这位卓越领袖的品格。

首先，看看尼希米的心。尽管他身为波斯王的臣仆，心中却无法不为神的子民和那破败的城深感忧伤。他的心常与他们同在，虽个人境况安泰。王察觉异样，问他为何愁眉不展。尼希米坦然回答：“城……已荒废，门被火焚烧，我的脸怎能不忧愁呢？”（尼2:3）城破人伤，神的居所如此凄凉，令他难以欢喜。他的心永远系于神的子民和圣地。

其次，留意尼希米的决心。他勇敢地请求亚达薛西王准许他回耶路撒冷，监督城墙重建。得蒙王恩后，他夜间秘密察看城墙，只带少数信任之人同行。随后，他向耶路撒冷的民众宣告：“来吧，我们建造耶路撒冷的城墙，使我们不再受人羞辱！”（尼2:17）他的热忱感染众人，激励他们一同起来帮助。尼希米的奉献精神蔓延开去。

最后，思量尼希米面对的阻力。几乎所有神圣的工作都免不了抵挡，这工程亦不例外。书中早早出现两位反对者——何罗尼人撒门巴列和亚扪人托比雅。撒门巴列可能是住在撒玛利亚的以色列人，因嫉妒权势而反对尼希米。托比雅是外邦的亚扪人，其动机不甚明朗。无论原因如何，他们都坚定地反对尼希米和归回的被掳民，妄图阻止神所呼召尼希米完成的工作。

> [!important]+ 反思与回应
神呼召像尼希米这样的人——热爱祂的子民，珍视祂的旨意，将耶稣基督的福音置于一切之上。今日，祈求神赐你一颗全然委身基督的心，求祂助你在面对阻力时仍坚定跟随基督，关怀祂的子民。

### <center>The Man of the Hour</center>

> [!question]+ Review
> 1. How did Nehemiah react when he heard the news about the broken walls of Jerusalem? What was his attitude? (See Nehemiah 1:3)
> 2. In Nehemiah's prayer, how does he view God's punishment on His people and God's promise of restoration? (See Nehemiah 1:9)
> 3. ⁠The article mentions that Nehemiah already has a plan; how should readers anticipate God's response to his prayer and the rebuilding of Jerusalem’s walls?

📖 **Passage to read**: ==Nehemiah 02==

> [!info]- 🎙️Audio: [A Daily Devotional - 06.06 - EN]()  

After praying earnestly for God’s hand to be with Jerusalem and its broken walls, Nehemiah realizes he is the man God has chosen for this crucial time. Let’s briefly consider three important qualities of Nehemiah, this remarkable leader.

First, look at Nehemiah’s heart. Even though he works for the Persian king, he cannot help but feel deeply troubled when he thinks about God’s people and their ruined city. His heart is with them, even though he himself is doing well. The king notices something is wrong and asks him why he looks so sad. Nehemiah answers plainly: “Why should my face not be sad when the city … lies in ruins and its gates have been destroyed by fire?” (2:3). Nehemiah cannot find joy while God’s city is broken. His heart remains with God’s people and their place.

Second, notice Nehemiah’s commitment. He boldly asks King Artaxerxes for permission to return to Jerusalem and rebuild the wall. Once he gains the king’s approval, he quietly surveys the wall at night, taking only a few trusted men with him. Then Nehemiah gathers the people and declares: “Let us build the wall of Jerusalem, so we will no longer be mocked” (2:17). His passion inspires the people to rise up and help. Nehemiah’s dedication spreads to those around him.

Finally, consider the opposition Nehemiah faces. Almost every meaningful work for God encounters resistance, and this is no different. Early in the story, we meet two enemies—Sanballat the Horonite and Tobiah the Ammonite. Sanballat might be an Israelite living in Samaria who opposes Nehemiah out of jealousy or a desire for power. Tobiah is an Ammonite, a foreigner, whose reasons are less clear. Regardless of their motives, these men stand firmly against Nehemiah and the returned exiles. They will try to stop the work God has called Nehemiah to do.

> [!important]+ Reflect and Respond
God calls people like Nehemiah—those who love His people and His purpose and value the gospel of Jesus Christ above all else. Today, pray that God would give you a heart fully committed to Jesus Christ. Ask Him to help you follow Christ and care for His people, even when faced with opposition.
