### <center>上帝，大审判者</center>

> [!info]- 🎙️Audio: [None]()


当上帝审判祂子民的罪时，这审判并不是祂最终的话。祂永不会永远弃绝祂的百姓。祂最后的话永远是拯救。《那鸿书》第三章向我们显明了这一真理。因着上帝仍然眷顾祂的子民，祂的审判必临到那些攻击、杀害、并欺压他们的人。

先知那鸿将这话指向亚述的首都尼尼微。大约一百年前，亚述毁灭了以色列的北国。诚然，上帝曾使用亚述来管教祂的子民，但这并不能为他们的残忍开脱。那鸿称尼尼微为“流人血的城，充满谎诈和抢夺”（3:1）。他又说尼尼微满了“淫行”和“邪术”（3:4），指的是充斥偶像崇拜与败坏的文化。尼尼微是一座沉溺于暴力、罪恶与淫乱的城。

因此，那鸿宣告审判必要临到。上帝对这城说：“我必将可憎污秽之物抛在你身上，辱没你，使你成为观瞻”（3:6）。尼尼微的结局，必与底比斯、古实和埃及一样。凡敌挡上帝、加害祂子民的列国，终必如此败亡。

令人震动的是，这信息让人想起约拿。一个世纪以前，约拿曾向尼尼微传道，全城都悔改，上帝便赦免了他们。但如今，两代之后，这城又完全回到从前的道路——罪恶、骄傲、暴力与偶像崇拜。这应当使我们警醒：罪能多么迅速地抓住整个文化，更何况是个人！

与此同时，那鸿提醒我们，上帝始终是为祂子民的。即便祂一时使用仇敌来管教祂的百姓，祂终不会容他们逍遥无惩。到末了，审判全地的主必亲自施行公义。

> [!important]+ 反思与回应
若你因信耶稣基督、借着祂的恩典成为上帝的儿女，你就可以安息在这应许中：上帝必定直到末了都站在你这边。你信吗？求祂坚固你的信心。纵然当下似乎公义无处可寻，你仍要信靠：上帝，这位大审判者，终必使万事得以成全。

### <center>God, the Great Judge</center>

> [!question]+ Review
> 4.⁠ ⁠In Micah 6:4, how does God remind Israel of his saving acts, and what does this mean for their relationship with him?
5.⁠ ⁠Why did the people think that many sacrifices and rituals could please God? What misunderstanding does this reveal?
6.⁠ ⁠According to Micah 6:8, what does it mean to “act justly, love mercy, and walk humbly with your God”? How can you live this out in your daily life?

📖 **Passage to read**: ==Nahum 03==

> [!info]- 🎙️Audio: [None]()  

When God judges the sins of his people, that judgment is never his final word. He does not abandon his people forever. His last word is always salvation. Nahum 3 shows us this truth. Because God is for his people, his judgment will fall on those who have attacked, killed, and abused them.

The prophet Nahum directs his message to Nineveh, the capital of Assyria. About a hundred years earlier, Assyria destroyed the northern kingdom of Israel. Yes, God used Assyria to bring discipline on his people, but that does not excuse their cruelty. Nahum calls Nineveh “the bloody city, all full of lies and plunder” (3:1). He describes it as a place of “whorings” and “charms” (3:4)—a culture of idolatry and corruption. Nineveh was a city deeply committed to violence, sin, and perversion.

For this reason, Nahum declares that judgment is coming. God says to the city: “I will throw filth at you and treat you with contempt and make you a spectacle” (3:6). Nineveh will fall just as Thebes, Cush, and Egypt did. Every nation that defies God and harms his people will meet the same end.

This word from Nahum is striking when we remember Jonah. A century before, Jonah preached to Nineveh. The whole city repented, and God spared them. But now, two generations later, the people have gone back to their old ways—sin, pride, violence, and idolatry. That should make us pause. Sin can take root in a culture, and in a person, very quickly.

At the same time, Nahum reminds us that God is always for his people. Even when he uses their enemies to discipline them, he will not leave those enemies unpunished. In the end, the Judge of all the earth will set things right.

> [!important]+ Reflect and Respond
If you belong to God through faith in Jesus Christ, then you can rest in this: God is for you until the end. Do you believe this? Ask him to strengthen your faith. Trust that even when justice seems hidden now, God, the great Judge, will make all things right.
