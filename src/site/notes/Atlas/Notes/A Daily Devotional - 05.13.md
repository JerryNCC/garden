### <center>审判即将来临</center>

> [!info]- 🎙️Audio: [A Daily Devotional - 05.13 - CN]()

当我们阅读这段经文时，感受到一种沉重的氛围：审判是不可避免的。以色列北国，尤其是其君王，正一步步走向他们所应得的后果。神对他们的罪与偶像崇拜的审判只是时间问题，迟早会全然降临。

我们知道这场审判即将来临，因为我们从神的启示中已经得知，神是完全圣洁的，祂绝不会让对祂圣名的亵渎与罪行不受惩罚。先知亚希雅，在见证了耶罗波安的罪行后，预见到有一天，以色列将因罪恶和偶像崇拜受到审判——他们将被流放到异国他乡。因为他们的偶像崇拜，以及他们的君王引导百姓在神面前犯罪，他们将被敌人征服并带走，敌人对神没有任何敬畏。

尽管我们在这段经文中没有看到流放的审判，但我们确实看到以色列君王们的不断堕落。首先我们听到关于巴沙的事，他像耶罗波安一样，将以色列带入更深的罪恶之中。巴沙的罪恶如此严重，以至于先知耶户对他发出了审判的预言。当巴沙的统治结束时，他的儿子以拉继位，然而他同样邪恶。仅仅两年的统治后，以拉被齐姆利暗杀，齐姆利不仅杀死了以拉和他的全家，还篡夺了王位。然而齐姆利的统治同样短暂，只有七天。当百姓反叛他时，他锁进宫殿并放火自焚，最终在火中死去。最后，王位落入了俄姆利之手，俄姆利继续行恶，像前任一样，犯了神眼中的罪，激怒了神，并引领百姓在偶像崇拜中犯罪。

巴沙、以拉、齐姆利、俄姆利——这些以色列的君王，他们和以色列的百姓正一路走向更加深重的悖逆与罪恶。这种下滑的趋势已经不可阻挡，神不会让它永远持续下去。审判即将来临。

> [!important]+ 反思与回应
在你反思这些时，花些时间感谢神的耐心。虽然祂是公义的，祂也是充满怜悯和耐心的，给人悔改的机会，并让人能够将信心寄托在耶稣基督身上。审判将来临，不仅是对以色列，也是对整个世界。但在基督里，我们找到了从审判中逃避的避难所。感谢神赐予我们的这份怜悯。

### <center>Judgment Is Coming</center>

> [!question]+ Review
> 1. 

📖 **Passage to read**: ==1 Kings 15:33-16:28==

> [!info]- 🎙️Audio: [A Daily Devotional - 05.13 - EN]()  

As we read through this passage, there’s a heavy sense that judgment is inevitable. The northern kingdom of Israel, especially its kings, is heading straight for the consequences of their actions. It's just a matter of time before God’s judgment against their sin and idolatry comes with full force.

We know this is coming because of what we’ve learned about God so far. God is completely holy, and He will not let sin go unpunished. The prophet Ahijah, while witnessing the sins of Jeroboam, looks ahead to a time when Israel will face judgment—an exile to a foreign land. Because of their idolatry and the sinful leadership of their kings, they will be defeated and taken away by enemies who have no love for God.

Although we don’t see the exile in this specific passage, we do see the continued downfall of Israel’s kings. First, we hear about Baasha, who, like Jeroboam, leads Israel deeper into sin. So severe is his sin that the prophet Jehu speaks a word of judgment against him. When Baasha’s reign ends, his son Elah takes over. He too is evil. After just two years of reign, Elah is assassinated by Zimri, a man who kills him and his entire family, seizing the throne for himself. Zimri’s reign, however, is shockingly short—only seven days! When the people turn against him, he locks himself inside the palace, setting it on fire, and dies in the blaze. Finally, Omri takes over after Zimri’s conspiracy fails. Like his predecessors, Omri does evil in God’s sight, leading the people further into sin and provoking the Lord’s anger with their idols.

Baasha, Elah, Zimri, Omri—the kings of Israel are spiraling deeper into rebellion and sin. The downward slide is unstoppable, and God will not let it continue forever. Judgment is coming soon.

> [!important]+ Reflect and Respond
As you reflect on this, take time to thank God for His patience. Though He is just, He is also merciful and patient, giving people time to repent and place their faith in Jesus Christ. Judgment is coming for Israel—and for this world too. But in Christ alone, we find refuge from judgment. Thank God for that mercy.
