### Identification of the Unknown Salt

#### Appearance:
- The unknown salt appears as a **white crystalline solid**.

#### Heating Test:
- **Procedure**: Heat a small amount of the solid in a test tube.
- **Observation**: pungent smell gas is released which can turn the blue litmus paper red.
> [!info]- Deduction
> Acidic gas is released, Sulphur Trioxide.

#### Test for Cations:
1. **Test with Sodium Hydroxide (NaOH)**:
   - **Procedure**: Add a few drops of **NaOH** solution to a small amount of the salt solution and then add excess NaOH.
   - **Observation**: A **white precipitate** forms. Soluble when NaOH added in excess.
> [!info]- Deduction
> **zinc hydroxide (Zn(OH)₂)** forms, which is **soluble in excess NaOH**, forming a **colorless solution**. This indicates the presence of **zinc ions (Zn²⁺)**.

2. **Test with Ammonia Solution (NH₃)**:
   - **Procedure**: Add a few drops of **ammonia solution** to a small amount of the salt solution, followed by excess ammonia.
   - **Observation**: A **white precipitate** forms, which is **soluble in excess ammonia**, forming a **colorless solution**. 
> [!info]- Deduction
> This further confirms the presence of **zinc ions (Zn²⁺)**.

#### Test for Anions:
1. **Test**:
   - **Procedure**: Add **barium chloride (BaCl₂)** solution to the salt solution, followed by a few drops of **dilute hydrochloric acid (HCl)**.
   - **Observation**: A **white precipitate** forms.
> [!info]- Deduction
> **Barium sulphate (BaSO₄)** forms, which is **insoluble** in dilute HCl. This confirms the presence of **sulphate ions (SO₄²⁻)**.

> - Final Observations and Conclusion:
> - **Cation Present**: Zinc ions (Zn²⁺)
> - **Anion Present**: Sulphate ions (SO₄²⁻)
