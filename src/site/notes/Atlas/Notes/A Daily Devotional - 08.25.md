人很容易以为，当生活一切顺利时，就是神喜悦我们的记号。若是功课考得好、比赛得胜、朋友众多，就觉得神必定在眷顾。但事实并非总是如此。

阿摩司向神的百姓说话的那时，表面上一切昌盛。经济繁荣，财富增长。百姓因此以为神认可他们的生活方式，甚至盼望神的审判临到四周的列国。

一开始，阿摩司的信息似乎正合他们的心意。他逐一指着以色列的邻国——大马士革、迦萨、推罗、以东、摩押、亚扪人，宣告神的审判快要临到。阿摩司说：“耶和华必从锡安吼叫”（1:2）。祂的审判必然大有能力，带来毁坏。这些列国得罪了神，也加害祂的子民，因此神要追讨他们的罪。

然而，令人震惊的转折随之而来。阿摩司不再指责外邦，而是转向神自己的百姓——犹大与以色列。神说：“我必不免去他们的刑罚，因为他们厌弃耶和华的训诲，不守祂的律例”（2:4）。与外邦列国不同，犹大与以色列明明有神的律法，却弃绝不行。他们的富足与太平，并不是神喜悦的凭据。相反，祂的审判也要临到他们，正如临到他们的邻邦一般，以烈火焚烧。

信息十分清楚：神的子民也不能例外。敌人不仅在外邦，更在他们心里——就是自己的罪。神的审判不仅临到“他们”，也同样临到“我们”。

但好消息是，神已经为祂的百姓预备了出路。借着祂儿子耶稣的死，神亲自使祂有罪的百姓得以与祂和好。因着十字架，那曾经作祂仇敌的，如今可以成为祂的朋友。

> 1.⁠ ⁠In Joel 2:1–17, how does Joel describe the coming of “the day of the LORD”?
2.⁠ ⁠Why does God still call His people to return to Him even in the midst of judgment?
3.⁠ ⁠How does this passage remind us to respond to God’s grace and steadfast love today?

📖 **Passage to read**: ==Amos 01:01-02:05==

> [!info]- 🎙️Audio: [None]()  

It’s easy for us to think that when life is going well, God must be pleased with us. If I’m getting good grades, winning games, and making friends, then surely God is smiling on me. But that’s not always true.

Amos spoke to God’s people during a time when everything looked good on the outside. The economy was strong, and wealth was increasing. People assumed this meant God approved of them. They even began to look forward to God’s judgment falling on the nations around them.

At first, Amos’s message seemed to confirm what they wanted to hear. He started by pointing to Israel’s neighbors—Damascus, Gaza, Tyre, Edom, Moab, and the Ammonites. Against each one, he announced God’s coming judgment. “The LORD roars from Zion,” Amos declared (1:2). God’s justice would come with power and destruction. These nations had sinned against God and against His people, and He would hold them accountable.

But then came the shocking turn. Amos turned from the pagan nations and pointed at God’s own people—Judah and Israel. God said, “I will not revoke the punishment, because they have rejected the law of the LORD, and have not kept his statutes” (2:4). Unlike the other nations, Judah and Israel had God’s law, yet they ignored it. Their wealth and prosperity did not mean God was pleased. In fact, His judgment would fall on them too, with the same fire that would consume their neighbors.

The message is clear: God’s people are not exempt. The enemy isn’t only out there in the nations; the enemy is also within—our own sin. God’s judgment doesn’t just fall on “them,” but also on “us.”

> [!important]+ Reflect and Respond
The good news is that God Himself has provided the answer. Through the death of His Son, Jesus, God has made a way for His sinful people to be reconciled to Him. Because of the cross, those who were once His enemies can now be called His friends.
