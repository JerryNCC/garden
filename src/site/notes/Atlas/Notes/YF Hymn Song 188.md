There is none like You  
No one else can touch my heart like You do  
I could search for all eternity long  
And find there is none like You  

There is none like You  
No one else can touch my heart like You do  
I could search for all eternity long (Oh-oh, oh-oh)  
And find there is none like You  
  
**Bridge**
Your mercy flows like a river wide  
And healing comes from Your hands  
Suffering children are safe in Your arms  
There is none like You  
  
**Chorus**
There is none like You  
No one else can touch my heart like You do  
I could search for all eternity long  
And find there is none like You
