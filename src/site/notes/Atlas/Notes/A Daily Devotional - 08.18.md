### <center>枯骨之谷</center>

> [!info]- 🎙️Audio: [None]()

主的灵带我进入一个异象。以西结看见自己站在一个山谷中，那景象并不美好——四周散落着骸骨，毫无生命气息。他特别留意到，这些骸骨极其枯干。这细节很重要：这些不是刚死去的遗骸，而是早已死去多时，毫无生机可言。

接着，神发出令人惊讶的命令：“你要向这些骸骨发预言。”（37:4）这似乎不可能。然而，当以西结宣告神的话语时，骸骨开始震动，彼此连接，形成完整的骨架；筋、肉和皮相继长在其上。不久，整个山谷不再是枯骨遍地，而是站立着一支极大的军队。

神解释这异象：“人子啊，这些骸骨就是以色列全家。他们说：‘我们的骸骨枯干了，我们的指望失去了，我们被剪除了。’……我必开你们的坟墓，将你们从坟墓中领出来，领你们进入以色列地。”（37:11-12）在被掳到巴比伦之时，神的百姓感到自己如同死去、被弃绝。然而，神在这里应许——即便在审判之后，祂仍要赐下复兴与生命。

这异象不仅仅关乎归回本地。神说：“我必将我的灵放在你们里面，你们就要活了。”（37:14）这是指向更深的更新——神要在祂的百姓中施行永久的工作。主耶稣似乎将这一幕与祂在《约翰福音》第三章对尼哥底母所说的话相连——人必须从圣灵重生，而不仅是从肉身而生。以西结所见的山谷，成为神极大作为的图画：祂在属灵上死去的人里面，吹入新的生命之气。

为着神借着圣灵在你里面所成就的奇妙工作感谢祂——使你在祂里面永远活着。让这现实塑造你今天的生活与行事为人。

### <center>Valley of Dry Bones</center>

> [!question]+ Review
> 1.⁠ ⁠In Ezekiel 37, who do the "dry bones" represent, and what was their situation at that time?
2.⁠ ⁠In the vision, God commands Ezekiel to prophesy to the bones. What spiritual message does this action convey?
3.⁠ ⁠God promises to put His Spirit within His people. In a spiritual sense, what kind of renewal and restoration does this promise point to?

📖 **Passage to read**: ==Ezekiel  37.01-14==

> [!info]- 🎙️Audio: [None]()  

The Spirit of the Lord takes Ezekiel into a vision. He finds himself in a valley, and it’s not a pleasant place. All around are bones—scattered, lifeless. Ezekiel notes that they are very dry. That detail matters. These aren’t the remains of someone who has just died. This is death long settled, with no sign of life left at all.

Then comes God’s surprising command: “Prophesy over these bones” (37:4). It seems impossible. But as Ezekiel speaks God’s words, the bones begin to rattle, connect, and form skeletons. Muscles, skin, and flesh cover them. Before long, the valley is filled—not with dry bones—but with a vast army standing alive.

God explains the vision: “Son of man, these bones are the whole house of Israel. They say, ‘Our bones are dried up, and our hope is gone; we are cut off.’ … I will open your graves and bring you back to the land of Israel” (37:11–12). God’s people felt dead and abandoned during their exile in Babylon. Yet here is His promise—restoration and life, even after judgment.

This vision is about more than just returning to the land. God says, “I will put my Spirit within you, and you shall live” (37:14). It points toward a deeper renewal, a permanent work of God in His people. Jesus seems to connect this scene to what He tells Nicodemus in John 3—about being “born again” by the Spirit, not just born of flesh. Ezekiel’s valley becomes a picture of God’s ultimate act: breathing new life into the spiritually dead.

> [!important]+ Reflect and Respond
Thank God for the miracle He has done in you through His Spirit—making you alive forever in Him. Let that reality shape the way you live today.
