如果你要简要总结《申命记》第六章，可以归结为一件事：记住。摩西希望百姓记住神为他们所做的一切，记住神向他们所说的一切。这种属灵的记忆将是他们生命的关键；没有它，他们将面临审判。

这种属灵记忆的概念首先出现在4至9节。摩西提醒百姓，所有律法的根基就是这一点：神是独一的，他们应当尽心尽力地爱神。在重复这个命令后，摩西开始向百姓解释，他们该如何确保记住这一点。

首先，他们要让神的话语成为个人的记忆。神的话要铭刻在他们心中——这可能意味着他们不仅要背诵神的话语，更要经常默想它。他们甚至被告知要将神的诫命写在家门框上，这样他们无法不记住它们！摩西呼吁百姓对神的话语作出深刻、个人的承诺，时刻铭记。

然而，这并不仅限于此。摩西还呼吁百姓将这份记忆传递给后代。他们要教导孩子们，并在日常生活的每个时刻谈论神的话语。神的百姓应当不仅个人记住神的话语和祂的救恩，还要一代代地传承下去。

在10至19节中，摩西提醒百姓，要保持这种记忆并不容易。属灵的记忆果然并非易事！摩西预见到百姓进入应许之地的时刻，那片充满祝福的土地。他们将拥有城市、食物和财富，而他们的自然倾向是忘记所有这些祝福都是来自神的。摩西警告他们，即使生活充满祝福，也要记住神，而不是在征服了应许之地后忘记神。

> [!important]+ 反思与回应
就像以色列人一样，我们也很容易忘记。我们会忘记。所以今天，请花点时间祷告，求神帮助你记住祂的话语和祂对你的恩典。立志拥有强大的属灵记忆，以免在生活中的美好事物中忘记神。所有的好事都来自神！

📖 **Passage to read**: ==Deuteronomy 06==

> [!info]- 🎙️Audio: [A Daily Devotional - 03.03 - EN]()  

If you want to sum up Deuteronomy 6 in a simple way, it’s all about one thing: remembering. Moses wants the people to remember everything God has done for them and everything God has said to them. This spiritual memory will be key to their lives, and without it, they will face judgment.

This idea of spiritual memory shows up first in verses 4–9. Moses reminds the people that the foundation of all their laws is this: God is one, and they are to love Him with everything they have. After repeating this command, Moses begins to explain how they are to make sure they remember it.

First, they are to make God’s word a personal memory. It should be in their hearts—likely meaning they should memorize it and not just hear it, but regularly think about it. They are even told to write God’s commandments on the doorposts of their homes, so they can’t help but remember them! Moses is calling them to a deep, personal commitment to remembering God’s word.

But it doesn’t stop there. Moses also calls the people to pass this memory down through generations. They are to teach their children and talk about God’s word all the time, in every part of life. The people of God are to remember His word and His salvation—not just personally but as a generation after generation.
In verses 10–19, Moses warns them about the challenges to keeping this kind of memory alive. Spiritual memory, it turns out, is not easy! Moses looks ahead to the time when the people will enter the promised land, a land full of blessings. They will have cities, food, and wealth—and their natural tendency will be to forget that all these blessings come from God. Moses warns them to remember God even when life is good, rather than forgetting Him once they’ve settled into the promised land.

> [!important]+ Reflect and Respond
Like the Israelites, we also struggle to remember. We forget. So today, take a moment to pray and ask God to help you remember His words and His grace toward you. Make it your goal to have a strong spiritual memory, so that you don’t forget Him in the midst of the good things in your life. All the good things come from Him!
