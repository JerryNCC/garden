### <center>认识尼希米</center>

> [!info]- 🎙️Audio: [A Daily Devotional - 06.05 - CN]()

尼希米的故事紧接在以斯拉之后。以斯拉讲述了一位忠心的祭司，带领神的子民真诚敬拜和悔改；而尼希米则展现了一位热切关心耶路撒冷城墙重建和神子民信仰忠诚恢复的人。两本书都彰显了神对祂子民的信实——即使他们经历了惩罚和被掳，神仍兴起忠心的领袖，将他们重新安置在应许之地。

这本书的开篇大约发生在以斯拉来到耶路撒冷十三年之后。尼希米是被掳的犹太人，在异乡得蒙恩宠，升任波斯王亚达薛西的酒政。一天，他从一位已经回到耶路撒冷的犹太兄弟那里听到了消息。消息沉重：“我们遭遇大难，遭受羞辱。”（尼1:3）耶路撒冷的城墙破败不堪，重建的工作远未完成。这座城市满目疮痍，脆弱无助，蒙受羞辱。

尽管身处波斯宫廷，尼希米对神和百姓的爱依旧炽热。当他听到这些消息时，心中十分痛惜。他转向神祷告，承认神的子民因违背神的命令而犯罪。同时，他紧紧抓住神的应许：尽管子民受了惩罚，但神应许说，只要他们回转归向祂，遵守祂的律法，“我必从天涯海角，将你们的流散人聚集回来，带到我所拣选的地方。”（尼1:9）

尼希米已有计划，我们将在第二章看到。第一章结束时，我们不禁心生疑问：神会如何回应尼希米的祷告？耶路撒冷的城墙会重建吗？更重要的是，神的子民将走向何方？

> [!important]+ 反思与回应
今天，当你祷告时，求神赐你一颗在不断变化与动荡的世界中仍坚定信靠祂的心。求祂帮助你无论遭遇苦难还是顺利，都能坚守对神和祂子民的爱。求祂让你的心永远扎根于祂，生命完全委身于祂的旨意。

### <center>Meet Nehemiah</center>

> [!question]+ Review
> 1. Why did Shikany (示迦尼) publicly confess the sins before Ezra and God? What attitude does this show about God's people?
> 2. ⁠Why does Ezra chapter 10 emphasize not only feeling remorse but also completely turning away from sin? What specific action of repentance did Shikany propose?
> 3. Why does the book of Ezra publicly name those who married foreign women? What significance does this have for the people of God then and for future readers?

📖 **Passage to read**: ==Nehemiah 10==

> [!info]- 🎙️Audio: [A Daily Devotional - 06.05 - EN]()  

Nehemiah is the story that follows Ezra. While Ezra tells us about a faithful priest leading God’s people in true worship and repentance, Nehemiah shows us a man who cares deeply about rebuilding Jerusalem’s walls and renewing the faithfulness of God’s people after exile. Both books highlight God’s faithfulness to His people. Even after their punishment and exile, God raises up faithful leaders to restore them to their land.

The book opens about thirteen years after Ezra arrived in Jerusalem. Nehemiah is a Jew living in exile who has found favor and risen to a high position—as cupbearer to King Artaxerxes of Persia. One day, he hears from a Jewish friend who has returned to Jerusalem. The news is grim: the people there face “great trouble and shame” (1:3). The walls of Jerusalem lie broken, and the rebuilding work is far from finished. The city is in ruins, vulnerable, and humiliated.

Despite his role in the Persian court, Nehemiah’s love for God and his people remains strong. When he hears the news, his heart breaks. He turns to God in prayer, confessing the sins of God’s people who have disobeyed His commands. At the same time, Nehemiah holds tightly to God’s promises. Though the people have been judged, God has promised to gather them again if they return to Him and obey His laws: “But if you return to me and keep my commandments and do them, though your outcasts are in the uttermost parts of heaven, from there I will gather them and bring them to the place that I have chosen” (1:9).

Nehemiah has a plan, which we will see in chapter 2. As chapter 1 ends, we are left wondering: How will God answer Nehemiah’s prayer? Will the walls of Jerusalem be rebuilt? And, more importantly, what will become of God’s people in Jerusalem?

> [!important]+ Reflect and Respond
As you pray today, ask God for a heart that remains faithful in a world that is constantly changing and uncertain. Pray that your love for God and His people would hold firm—whether you face hardship or success. Ask Him to keep your heart anchored in Him and your life fully devoted to His service.
