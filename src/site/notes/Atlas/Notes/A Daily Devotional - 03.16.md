### <center>更新圣约</center>

> [!info]- 🎙️Audio: [A Daily Devotional - 03.16 - CN]()

艾城之战后，以色列人聚集在一起，举行了一场特别的仪式——圣约更新礼。乍一看，这似乎只是一个古老的仪式，容易被我们略过。但它远不止于此！让我们仔细看看这个事件的发生以及它的重要性。

首先，这场仪式并非偶然，而是神借着摩西特别吩咐的。如果我们回到申命记 27:1-8，就会看到摩西曾为这次仪式作出详细指示。而如今，以色列的领袖约书亚正在践行神的话语，带领百姓遵行神的命令。

其次，这场仪式中有两个关键的环节值得我们留意，若匆匆阅读，很容易忽略。首先，约书亚让百姓用石灰覆盖大石，并在上面刻写神的律法，这象征着他们立志将神的话语铭刻于心，作为生活的中心。然后，百姓分成两组，分别站在两座山上——基利心山和以巴路山，中间隔着一道山谷。随后，他们开始互相呼喊，一方宣告遵行神律法所带来的祝福，另一方则呼应违背律法所带来的咒诅。试想，那是怎样的场景！成千上万的人站在对立的山上，高声呼喊神的律法！他们刚进入应许之地，就立刻郑重地承诺要在神的话语下生活。

> [!important]+ 反思与回应
这个仪式对今天的我们也有深刻的启示。我们是否将神的话语放在生命的核心，将其刻在心里，并以之塑造自己的决定？我们是否身处信仰群体之中，在彼此的生活中传讲神的真理，互相勉励？今天，让我们祈求神，使我们在生命的每一个方面都顺服祂的话语。求神的经文每天引导我们的道路，让我们能忠实地向他人传讲神的真理，同时也愿意聆听来自弟兄姊妹的属灵劝勉。

### <center>Renewing the Covenant</center>

> [!question]+ Review
> 1. ⁠What impact did Achan's sin have on the entire nation of Israel? What does this reveal about the nature of sin?  
> 2. Why was God's punishment for Achan so severe? What does this reflect about God's attitude toward sin?  
> 3. How can we be vigilant and deal with sin in our own lives to avoid affecting our faith community?

📖 **Passage to read**: ==Joshua 08:30-35==

> [!info]- 🎙️Audio: [A Daily Devotional - 03.16 - EN]()  

After the battle of Ai, the people of Israel gather for a special ceremony—a covenant renewal service. At first glance, this might seem like an old ritual, something we could easily skim over. But it’s much more than that! Let’s take a closer look at what happens here and why it matters.

First, this ceremony isn’t just a random event. It’s something God specifically commanded through Moses. If we go back to Deuteronomy 27:1–8, we see Moses giving instructions for this very occasion. Now, Joshua, the leader of Israel, is following through. He is obeying God’s word and leading the people in doing the same.

Second, there are two key aspects of this ceremony that stand out. If we read too quickly, we might miss them. First, Joshua has the people cover large stones with plaster and write the words of God’s law on them. This act shows their commitment to keeping God’s word central in their lives. Then, the people divide into two groups, each standing on a different mountain—Mount Gerizim and Mount Ebal. With a valley between them, they begin calling out to one another. One group shouts the blessings that come from obeying God’s law, while the other group shouts the curses that come from disobedience. Imagine thousands of people, standing on these mountains, proclaiming God’s word back and forth! Even as they enter the promised land, they immediately reaffirm their commitment to live under God’s law.

> [!important]+ Reflect and Respond
This ceremony holds an important lesson for us today. Are we making God’s word central in our lives—writing it on our hearts, shaping our decisions by it, and speaking it to one another? Are we part of a community of believers where we hear God’s truth and encourage each other to live by it? Take time today to ask God to help you stay under his word in every area of life. Pray that his Scripture would guide you daily, that you would speak his truth to others, and that you would be willing to listen to it from those around you.
