To help your students avoid these errors, here are some sentence patterns and structures that emphasize how to correctly discuss activities like sports:

### 1. Expressing the *Benefits* of an Activity
   - **"[Activity] can help you improve your [skill/ability]."**
     - Example: "Playing badminton can help you improve your hand-eye coordination."

   - **"By practicing [activity], you can develop [skill]."**
     - Example: "By practicing badminton, you can develop teamwork skills."

### 2. Describing *What You Learn* from an Activity
   - **"[Activity] teaches you how to [skill/verb]."**
     - Example: "Badminton teaches you how to be quick and focused."

   - **"You can learn [skill] by playing [activity]."**
     - Example: "You can learn discipline by playing badminton."

### 3. Talking About *How the Activity Makes You Feel* or *What It Does for You*
   - **"[Activity] helps you feel [adjective]."**
     - Example: "Badminton helps you feel more energetic."

   - **"[Activity] helps keep you [adjective/healthy]."**
     - Example: "Badminton helps keep you active."

For a basic approach, emphasize these structures:
- "**Playing [activity]** helps/teaches you to...".
- Avoid saying "the badminton" or making the activity itself the subject that "learns" or "improves."

### When to Use "Badminton" Directly as the Subject:

In certain cases, it’s okay to start with "badminton" directly, particularly when you’re describing the general nature or characteristics of the sport, rather than its effects on people. Examples include:

- "Badminton is a fast-paced sport."
- "Badminton requires agility and quick reflexes."
