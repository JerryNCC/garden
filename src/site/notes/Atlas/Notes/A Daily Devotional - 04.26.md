### <center>逃亡中的王</center>

> [!info]- 🎙️Audio: [A Daily Devotional - 04.26 - CN]()

大卫的苦难尚未结束。他的儿子押沙龙不仅心怀愤怒，更怀有野心与危险的阴谋。他并不满足于仅仅报复暗嫩，如今，他想要王位，并且愿意不择手段来夺取它。押沙龙从父亲那里学会了操纵和欺骗，但他却没有学到最重要的一课——在神面前真正悔改。

押沙龙用自己的魅力、花言巧语和俊美的外貌赢得了民心。这一招十分奏效，以色列百姓的心逐渐倾向于他。等到大卫察觉时，已然为时已晚——押沙龙“偷了以色列人的心”（撒下 15:6）。他的阴谋迅速扩大，很快便聚集了一群有影响力的支持者。大卫意识到危险已迫在眉睫，他和家人别无选择，只能匆忙逃离耶路撒冷。这是一个令人心碎的场景——昔日受万人敬仰的以色列大君，如今却不得不仓皇逃命，避开自己亲生儿子的逼迫。

这一切是如何发生的？昔日何等尊贵、受神膏立的君王，如今竟落魄至此，亡命天涯！这段经文提醒我们一个残酷的现实：罪必引发更多的罪。大卫曾犯下的罪，尽管已经蒙神赦免，却仍然带来了难以挽回的后果。押沙龙在效仿父亲，肆意夺取他想要的东西，而不顾及他人。但与大卫不同的是，押沙龙从未向神悔改。他从未为自己杀害暗嫩的罪行认罪悔改。大卫对他的接纳和拥抱并不是他真正需要的——押沙龙需要的是一位公义且严明的父亲给予的惩戒。

> [!important]+ 反思与回应
这段故事值得我们深思。首先，它展现了罪的可怕力量。罪从不会停留在最初的阶段，它会蔓延、破坏，并带来更大的恶果。因此，我们必须警醒，警惕每天围绕我们的试探。其次，这个故事也指向了耶稣——那位彻底战胜罪与死亡的救主。祂是我们的盼望。罪不会永远掌权，因着基督，我们得享自由。今天，请向神献上感恩，感谢祂差派爱子，使我们得以从罪与死亡的权势中得释放！

### <center>King on the Run</center>

> [!question]+ Review
> 1. In 2 Samuel 12, Nathan conveyed God’s punishment to David. How were these punishments fulfilled in chapter 13?  
> 2. What kind of chain reaction did sin create in David’s family? How does Absalom’s revenge demonstrate the ongoing effects of sin?  
> 3. How does this passage remind us of the seriousness of sin? How can we stay vigilant in our lives to avoid falling into similar sins?

📖 **Passage to read**: ==2 Samuel 15==

> [!info]- 🎙️Audio: [A Daily Devotional - 04.26 - EN]()  

David’s troubles aren’t over yet. His son Absalom isn’t just angry—he’s ambitious and dangerous. He’s not content with simply taking revenge on Amnon. Now, he wants the throne for himself, and he’ll do whatever it takes to get it. Like his father, Absalom has learned how to manipulate and deceive, but he hasn’t learned the most important lesson—true repentance before God.

Absalom starts by winning people over with charm, smooth words, and his striking appearance. And it works. The people of Israel begin to turn toward him, and before David knows it, Absalom has stolen their hearts (15:6). His conspiracy gains momentum, and soon he has a strong group of supporters behind him. David realizes the danger too late. He and his household have no choice but to flee Jerusalem. It’s a heartbreaking moment—the great king of Israel, once loved and honored, now running for his life from his own son.

How did it come to this? The mighty ruler of God’s people, once at the height of his power, now finds himself on the run. This passage reminds us of a hard truth: sin leads to more sin. David’s past sins, even though forgiven, are still bringing painful consequences. Absalom is following in his father’s footsteps, taking what he wants without regard for others. But unlike David, Absalom never turned back to God. He never repented for killing his brother Amnon. David’s acceptance of him wasn’t enough—Absalom needed the discipline of a just and righteous father.

> [!important]+ Reflect and Respond
This story gives us two things to consider. First, it shows how dangerous sin is. It never stays small—it spreads and destroys. That should remind us to stay watchful against the temptations we face every day. Second, it points us to Jesus, the one who broke the power of sin and death once and for all. He is our hope. Sin will not last forever. Because of Christ, we can be free. Take a moment today to thank God for sending his Son, who conquered sin and death for us.
