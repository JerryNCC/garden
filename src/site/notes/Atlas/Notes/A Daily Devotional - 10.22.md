### <center>唯独因信，唯独在基督里</center>

> [!info]- 🎙️Audio: [None]()

即使是最健康、最稳固的教会，也难免经历分歧与挑战。初代教会也不例外。虽然他们经历了福音迅速传播、信徒不断增长的喜乐时刻，却同样面对不少张力与纷争。随着福音广传古代世界，许多犹太人相信耶稣是那位神所应许的弥赛亚；与此同时，也有许多没有犹太背景的外邦人，信靠祂为他们的救主与主。这种新群体的结合带来了美好的图画，也带来了复杂的张力。新约多卷书信，正是为了解决这些在教会内部产生的张力而写。

在《使徒行传》的这一阶段，神的救赎工作仍主要（虽然并非完全）在犹太群体中展开。因此，当外邦人开始加入信仰群体时，出现一些问题也就不足为奇了。第十五章便记录了一场关键的争议——一些来自耶路撒冷的犹太教导者，坚称外邦信徒必须受割礼才能得救。换句话说，他们认为信耶稣还不够，若要真正被神接纳，就必须遵守犹太的律法与规条。

彼得、保罗和巴拿巴坚决反对这种说法。他们见证圣灵如何亲自临到外邦人，使他们得以与犹太信徒同蒙恩典。他们竭力维护福音的纯正——救恩不是靠人的行为或宗教仪式，而是单单出于恩典，凭着信心，借着耶稣基督而得。最终，教会领袖们达成一致：不要求外邦信徒受割礼，只劝勉他们远避淫乱，也不吃拜偶像之物，以过圣洁生活。

这件事之所以如此重要，是因为保罗、彼得和巴拿巴看见，这不仅是一场关于礼仪的争论，而是触及福音核心的问题。若信徒开始认为“耶稣 + 其他事物”才能得救，那么恩典的真义就被扭曲了。遗憾的是，今天我们也可能落入类似的陷阱——以为需要“耶稣 + 善行”、“耶稣 + 道德表现”、“耶稣 + 宗教热心”，才能真正被神悦纳。然而，这一切都不是事实，甚至是危险的思想。

> [!important]+ 反思与回应
在初代教会中，那些没有犹太背景、单单信靠耶稣的外邦人，完全得着了救恩的份。这真理直到今天仍然成立：**唯独耶稣就够了。** 祂已成全一切，祂的恩典是完全的。让我们求神再次提醒我们这荣耀的事实——我们的救恩、平安与盼望，全都在基督里。让我们全心倚靠祂，因为祂配得我们完全的信靠。

> [!question]+ Review
> 1. Why did Paul, when preaching in the synagogue at Pisidian Antioch, move directly from David to Jesus? What does this transition reveal about the central message of Scripture?
> 2. According to Acts 13:38–39, how does Jesus’ death and resurrection bring forgiveness and freedom to sinners? How does this differ from the law of Moses?
> 3. How did the Gentiles respond to the gospel compared to the Jews? What does this teach us about the universality of the gospel and the different responses of the human heart?

Even the best and strongest churches face disagreements and challenges. The early church was no different. Though it was growing quickly and filled with excitement, it still had its share of struggles. As the gospel began to spread through the ancient world, many Jews believed in Jesus as the Messiah whom God had promised. At the same time, many Gentiles—those without a Jewish background—also came to faith in Him as their Savior and Lord. This new mix of believers brought both beauty and tension to the growing church, and many New Testament letters were written to help the church work through those issues.

Up to this point in Acts, most of God’s work had taken place among the Jewish people, though not exclusively. So, it isn’t surprising that questions arose when Gentiles began to join the community of faith. In Acts 15, we read about one of the earliest and most serious disputes. Some Jewish teachers were insisting that Gentile believers had to be circumcised in order to be saved. In effect, they were saying that faith in Jesus wasn’t enough—you needed to become Jewish, to keep the customs and laws, in order to be accepted by God.

Peter, Paul, and Barnabas would not accept this. They told how God’s Holy Spirit had already come to the Gentiles, showing that they were fully accepted by Him. They defended the purity of the gospel—that salvation comes by grace through faith in Jesus alone. It does not come through ceremonies, rituals, or human traditions. In the end, the church leaders reached an agreement: Gentile Christians did not need to be circumcised. Instead, they were simply encouraged to live holy lives, avoiding sexual immorality and staying away from food offered to idols.

This matter was not small to Peter, Paul, and Barnabas. They saw that the heart of the gospel was at stake. If believers started to think they needed Jesus _plus_ something else, they would lose the very essence of grace. Sadly, we can fall into that same trap today. We might think that we need Jesus plus good works, Jesus plus moral success, or Jesus plus religious performance. But that is never true—and it’s spiritually dangerous.

> [!important]+ Reflect and Respond
In the early church, Gentiles who had no Jewish background were saved fully and freely by faith in Christ alone. That truth still stands today. Jesus is enough—completely and forever. Ask God to remind you of this great reality: your salvation, your peace, and your hope rest in Christ alone. Trust Him fully, for He alone is worthy.
