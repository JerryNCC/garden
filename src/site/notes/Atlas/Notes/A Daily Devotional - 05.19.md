### <center>以利沙</center>

> [!info]- 🎙️Audio: [A Daily Devotional - 05.19 - CN]()

在以色列和犹大的历史中，曾有许多好的和不好的王，但无论如何，神的先知始终作为祂的代表继续服侍神。在《列王纪下》第二章中，我们见证了先知事工中的一个重要转折——以利亚与以利沙之间的接棒交接。以利亚曾是神的勇敢代言人，直言不讳地向像亚哈这样的君王传达神的话语。但如今，以利亚的生命和事工即将结束，而他的门徒以利沙则准备好接过这个责任。这一章中，我们看到三个关键时刻，我们不容忽视。

首先，我们看到以利沙接受了神所赐的、充满圣灵的先知事工。以利沙向以利亚请求：“求你让我得你灵的双倍。”这是一个既表达对神更大能力的渴求，也承认以利亚作为神先知角色的请求（2:9）。以利亚告诉他，如果以利沙看见他被带走，那么神就会应允他的请求。果然，以利沙看见了以利亚被接走，而当他用以利亚的外衣分开水面时，这是一个明确的标志，表明神已经将先知的事工交托给了他。

其次，以利沙得到了神的能力，成为行神迹的先知。当耶利哥的居民带着一个问题来找以利沙——水源受到污染，无法饮用——以利沙便凭借神的力量奇迹般地治好了水源。这个治水的神迹显示出神在确认以利沙的先知呼召，并赐予他帮助以色列百姓的神力，正如神以前通过以利亚所做的那样。

最后，以利沙得到了作为神先知执行审判的权柄。在伯特利附近，一群年轻人嘲笑他，侮辱神的先知。以利沙因此召唤了两只母熊，将四十二个男孩撕裂。这是一个令人震惊的时刻。难道以利沙反应过度了吗？他是不是失去了控制？不，这些年轻人来自一个以偶像崇拜著称的地方，他们对神的先知进行嘲笑，实际上是在侮辱神自己。这个审判提醒我们，罪的严重性和神圣洁的现实。以利沙凭借神所赋予的权柄，执行了神的审判。

> [!important]+ 反思与回应
以利沙的一生，预示着那位伟大的先知——耶稣的来临。耶稣不仅会传讲神的话语，祂自己将成为道成肉身，为所有信靠祂的人带来救恩。神对祂百姓的信实永不止息，祂不断地通过像以利沙这样的先知将祂的话语传递给百姓，最终祂将亲自差遣祂的儿子来成就救恩的应许。神的工作无休无止，祂将继续通过祂的话语引导祂的百姓，一代又一代。

📖 **Passage to read**: ==2 Kings 02==

> [!info]- 🎙️Audio: [A Daily Devotional - 05.19 - EN]()  


In the history of Israel and Judah, there were many good and bad kings, but throughout it all, God’s prophets continued to serve as His representatives. One of the key transitions in the prophetic ministry happens in 2 Kings 2, where we see the passing of the mantle between Elijah and Elisha. Elijah had been God’s bold spokesperson, confronting kings like Ahab and speaking truth to power. But now, Elijah’s time is coming to an end, and Elisha, his disciple, is stepping up to carry on the work. This chapter highlights three key moments we should notice.

First, we see that Elisha receives the spirit-filled ministry of Elijah. Elisha asks Elijah for a double portion of his spirit, a request that signifies both a desire for a greater measure of God’s power and a recognition of Elijah’s role as God’s prophet (2:9). Elijah tells Elisha that if he witnesses Elijah being taken away to heaven, it will be the sign that God has granted his request. Elisha does see Elijah depart, and as Elijah’s cloak parts the waters for him, it is a clear sign that God has now passed on the prophetic ministry to Elisha.

Second, Elisha receives the power of God to perform miracles as a prophet. When the men of Jericho come to him with a problem—polluted and undrinkable water—Elisha miraculously heals the water. This act of healing shows that God is confirming Elisha’s prophetic calling, granting him divine power to help the people of Israel, just as He had done through Elijah.

Finally, Elisha receives the authority to execute judgment as God’s prophet. After being mocked by a group of young people near Bethel, Elisha calls down two bears to maul forty-two boys. It’s a shocking moment. Did Elisha overreact? Is he losing control? No, these young men, from a region notorious for its idolatry, were mocking the prophet of God, and in doing so, they were mocking God himself. This judgment reminds us of the seriousness of sin and the reality of God’s holiness. Elisha’s authority, granted by God, allowed him to carry out this act of judgment.

> [!important]+ Reflect and Respond
These moments in Elisha’s life point us forward to Jesus, the ultimate prophet who will not only speak God’s word but will be the Word made flesh, bringing salvation to all who trust in Him. God is faithful to His people, sending His word through prophets like Elisha, and ultimately sending His Son to fulfill the promise of salvation. God’s work is unceasing, and He will continue to guide His people with His word, from one generation to the next.
