### Essay Question: Identification of an Unknown Salt

You are provided with an unknown salt. Your task is to identify the salt by performing a series of tests and making step-by-step deductions based on your observations. The salt in question is **Iron (III) Chloride (FeCl₃)**.

#### Information:
- **Appearance of the Salt**: The unknown salt appears as a **brown solid**.
- **Heating**: salt doesn't decompose. 
#### Tests for Cation and Anion:

1. **Test for Cation (Metal Ion)**:
    - **Procedure**: Add a few drops of **sodium hydroxide (NaOH)** solution to a small amount of the salt dissolved in water.
    - **Observation**: A **brown precipitate** forms.
> [!info]- Deduction
> It is **Iron (III) hydroxide (Fe(OH)₃)**. This confirms the presence of **Fe³⁺** ions.

2. **Test for Anion (Non-Metal Ion)**:
    - **Procedure**: Add diluted nitric acid and add a few drops of **silver nitrate (AgNO₃)** solution to a small amount of the salt solution.
    - **Observation**: **No precipitate** forms.
> [!info]- Deduction
> This indicates that the anion is **chloride (Cl⁻)**. 

#### Confirmatory Tests:

1. **Confirmatory Test**:
    - **Procedure**: Add a few drops of **potassium ferrocyanide (K₄[Fe(CN)₆])** solution to a small amount of the salt solution.
    - **Observation**: A **blue precipitate**  forms.
> [!info]- Deduction
> This confirms the presence of **Iron (III)** ions (Fe³⁺).

2. **Confirmatory Test**:
    - **Procedure**: Add a few drops of **dilute nitric acid (HNO₃)** followed by **silver nitrate (AgNO₃)** solution to a small portion of the salt solution.
    - **Observation**: A **white precipitate** forms.
> [!info]- Deduction
> **Silver chloride (AgCl)** forms, confirming the presence of **chloride ions (Cl⁻)**.

#### Task:
Based on the information provided and the results from the tests, identify the unknown salt. Write a detailed essay that outlines each step of the process, from observing the appearance of the salt, conducting the tests for the cation and anion, and applying the confirmatory tests. Your deductions should lead to the identification of the salt.

- **Your final answer should include the chemical formula of the salt in LaTeX format**.

> [!warning]- Answer
> - **Iron (III) Chloride (FeCl₃)** is a **yellowish-brown** solid.
> - **Fe³⁺ ions** react with sodium hydroxide to form a **brown precipitate** of **Iron (III) hydroxide** (\( \text{Fe(OH)}_3 \)).
> - **Chloride ions (Cl⁻)** do not react with silver nitrate to form a precipitate, distinguishing them from other halides.
> - The formation of a **blue precipitate** with **potassium ferrocyanide** confirms the presence of **Fe³⁺** ions.
