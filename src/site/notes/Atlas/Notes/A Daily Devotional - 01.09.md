### <center>神与挪亚的约</center>

> [!info]- 🎙️Audio: [A Daily Devotional - 01.09 - CN]()

洪水终于退去，神所降的浩劫告一段落。这是人类历史上的一次新起点。神以挪亚和他的家人重新开始，并赐予他们与亚当和夏娃当年一样的命令：“要生养众多，遍满地面”（创世记9:1）。试想，挪亚和他的家人该是多么感激神的恩典！他们是唯一逃脱神审判的人，必定充满期待地迎接新的人类篇章，不是吗？

但让我们冷静下来想一想。神刚刚因罪恶审判了几乎全人类。挪亚是义人不错，可他的家人呢？他们的后代呢？谁能保证人类不会再次堕落，以至于迎来另一次全球性毁灭？如果我是挪亚的儿子，恐怕心中难免不安，对未来充满疑虑。

然而，翻开圣经，我们会一次又一次看到一个真理：神是满有恩典和怜悯的。这一点在神与挪亚和他家人所立的约中展现得淋漓尽致。神应许，他永远不会再以洪水毁灭全地。他多次重申这个约，并且赐下一个标记——天上的彩虹。那美丽的彩虹成为他信守承诺的象征，提醒人们他的信实不渝。

神难道不知道挪亚的后代会继续犯罪、悖逆他吗？他当然知道。即便如此，他仍然选择怜悯，不再以洪水毁灭世人。相反，他容许人类的生命延续下去。终有一天，罪恶会被彻底清算，神也必再次审判全地。但现在，他以耐心和恩典守住自己的承诺，即便我们不配得。

> [!important]+ 反思与回应
花点时间默想这位守约施恩的神吧。他将生命赐给罪人，这是何等的恩典！感谢他赐予你的生命，记住他是一位对不配之人仍守信的神。如果你属于耶稣，神同样对你有应许：他应许赦免你，接纳你，引领你，并保守你，直到有一天，你能面对面见到他。

### <center>God’s Covenant with Noah</center>

> [!question]+ Review
>1. According to Genesis 6, why did God decide to judge the earth with a flood? What does this reveal about His character?
>2. Noah is described as a "righteous man" who "walked with God." How did he stand in contrast to the corrupt and violent generation of his time?
>3. What kind of covenant did God establish with Noah during the judgment? What promises and significance did this covenant hold?

📖 **Passage to read**: ==Genesis 08:20-09:17==

> [!info]- 🎙️Audio: [A Daily Devotional - 01.09 - EN](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1-JbGos42GjTmRk8WN16uu1KBaXpMMzgV/view?usp=drive_link) ✅


The great flood sent by God has finally ended, and the waters have subsided. This moment marks a new beginning for humanity. God starts over with Noah and his family, giving them the same command he once gave to Adam and Eve: “Be fruitful and multiply and fill the earth” (Genesis 9:1). Imagine how grateful Noah and his family must have been! They were the only ones spared from God’s judgment. Surely, they were ready and excited to begin this fresh chapter of humanity, right?

But let’s take a step back. God had just brought judgment on nearly the entire human race because of their sin. While Noah was righteous, what about his family? What about their future descendants? What assurance is there that humanity won’t fall into sin again, prompting another worldwide judgment? If I were one of Noah’s sons, I might feel anxious, wondering what the future held.

Throughout the Bible, one truth comes through again and again: God is gracious and merciful. We see this clearly in the covenant he makes with Noah and his family. God promises that he will never again destroy the earth with a flood. He repeats this promise several times and even gives a sign to confirm it—a rainbow in the sky. This beautiful symbol serves as a reminder of God’s commitment to this promise.

Does God know that Noah’s descendants will sin and rebel against him? Yes, he does. But in his mercy, God chooses not to bring destruction again through a flood. Instead, he allows humanity to continue. One day, sin will be dealt with permanently, and God will judge the earth. But for now, he shows his patience and grace, keeping his promises even though we don’t deserve them.

> [!important]+ Reflect and Respond
Take a moment to marvel at this God who keeps his word to sinful people. The life we have today is a gift of his grace. Thank him for your life and remember that he is a God who makes and keeps promises to the undeserving. If you belong to Jesus, he has made a promise to you as well—a promise to forgive, accept, guide, and keep you until the day you see him face to face.
