### <center>快节奏的福</center>

> [!info]- 🎙️Audio: [None]()

想像一下：学校里发生了一件令人振奋的大事，你迫不及待要告诉朋友。你一路飞奔在走廊上，连喘口气的时间都没有，只想立刻把消息传出去。读马可福音就像这种感觉——节奏紧凑、急切，好像马可迫不及待要告诉我们耶稣的好消息。

马可开篇就直截了当：“神的儿子，耶稣基督福音的起头”（马可福音1:1）。他毫不迟疑地宣告耶稣是谁，以及祂为何而来。马可引用先知以赛亚的话，讲到那位在主前面预备道路的使者，然后立刻带我们进入情节。施洗约翰出现，宣讲悔改、受洗以得罪的赦免。但约翰清楚指出，将有一位比他更大的要来。

接着——几乎是突然——耶稣登场。马可简洁却有力地描述耶稣受洗的场景。我们听见天上有声音说：“你是我的爱子，我喜悦你”（1:11）。随后，马可用了他最喜欢的词：“立刻”。耶稣被圣灵催促进入旷野，接受撒但的试探。马可没有多加细节，却让信息十分清晰。

马可要我们抓住最重要的事实：耶稣是神的儿子；祂成就了神借着先知早已应许的救恩。当耶稣开始祂的事工时，祂的信息简洁有力：“日期满了，神的国近了，你们当悔改，信福音！”（1:15）因为耶稣是神的儿子，又成全了神的应许，祂呼召众人离弃罪恶，信靠这好消息。

> [!important]+ 反思与回应
感谢神差遣祂的儿子来成就一切应许。若你还未悔改、相信，就不要再迟延。今天就向耶稣承认你的罪，信靠祂，从此跟随祂。

📖 **Passage to read**: ==Mark 01:01-15==

> [!info]- 🎙️Audio: [None]()  

Picture this: something exciting happens at school, and you need to tell your friends right away. You run down the hall, eager to share the news before you even catch your breath. That’s what it feels like to read Mark’s Gospel. It moves quickly, almost urgently, as if Mark can’t wait to tell us about Jesus.

Mark starts with a bold opening: “The beginning of the gospel of Jesus Christ, the Son of God” (1:1). He wastes no time telling us who Jesus is and why he came. After quoting the prophet Isaiah about a messenger preparing the way for the Lord, Mark jumps straight into action. John the Baptist appears, calling people to repent and be baptized for the forgiveness of sins. But John makes it clear that someone greater is coming.

And then—almost suddenly—Jesus shows up. Mark gives us a brief but powerful scene of Jesus’s baptism. We hear the voice from heaven say, “You are my beloved Son; with you I am well pleased” (1:11). Right after that, Mark uses his favorite word: immediately. Jesus is sent by the Spirit into the wilderness to face temptation from Satan. Mark keeps the details short, but the point is clear.

Mark wants us to know the essential facts. Jesus is the Son of God. He fulfills the promises God made long ago through the prophets. And when Jesus begins his ministry, his message is simple and direct: “The time is fulfilled, and the kingdom of God is at hand; repent and believe in the gospel” (1:15). Because Jesus is God’s Son and God’s promises have come true in him, he calls everyone to turn from sin and trust the good news.

> [!important]+ Reflect and Respond
Thank God for sending his Son to keep every promise. If you haven’t yet repented and believed, don’t wait. Confess your sins to Jesus today. Trust him and follow him.
