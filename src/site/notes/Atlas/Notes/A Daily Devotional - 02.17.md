### <center>人类的至高福祉</center>

> [!info]- 🎙️Audio: [A Daily Devotional - 02.17 - CN]()

如果我们把《利未记》当作一篇高中论文来看，第26章就像是作者开始总结段落的地方。神正在以强烈直接的话语和重要的观点结束对祂子民的指示。

首先，这里有一个非常重要的点，容易被忽视，那就是神想要赐给祂的子民的奖赏。神希望赐给忠心的百姓什么呢？是土地、财富、地位，还是名声？不，最伟大的礼物——至高的福祉——就是神自己。再看一下第11至12节，神说：“我要在你们中间设立我的居所；我的心也不厌弃你们，我必在你们中间行走，要作你们的神，你们要作我的子民。”神为祂的百姓所做的一切，无论是祂所赐的律法，还是祂的整个计划，最终都聚焦于祂渴望与祂的百姓同在，成为他们的神。

其次，神向祂的百姓发出了一个非常严肃的警告，关于如果他们不遵守神的律法，按照神的旨意生活，后果会是什么。在第14至39节中，神警告他们，如果他们不顺从，将面临可怕的惩罚：疾病、饥荒、被敌人打败、野兽的攻击、流放等等。神对罪恶是非常严肃的！

最后，尽管神警告祂的百姓如果不顺从将会面临惩罚，但祂也向他们保证，祂永远不会忘记与他们所立的约。即使在他们被流放期间，神也会记得祂的应许。神说：“纵然如此，他们在仇敌之地，我也不厌弃他们，也不憎恶他们，以致完全毁灭他们，破坏我与他们所立的约；因为我是耶和华他们的神” （26:44）。神必定审判罪恶，因为祂是圣洁的，但祂永远不会完全且永远地弃绝祂的子民。

那么，神如何能够同时审判罪恶，又能保持祂与祂百姓的约，赐福给他们并永不抛弃他们呢？其中一个方法就是：神自己——耶稣，神的儿子——为罪人代替受罚。耶稣替代祂的百姓承担了应得的惩罚，这样神才能完全兑现对他们的所有应许。今天让我们一起赞美神，并感谢祂通过耶稣为我们所做的一切。

### <center>Man’s Highest Good</center>

> [!question]+ Review
> 1.⁠ ⁠Why does God place such importance on the Sabbath and command His people to observe it?  
> 2.⁠ ⁠What instructions does God give about the Sabbath year in Leviticus 25? What does it require from the people and the land?  
> 3.⁠ ⁠How should we reflect the importance of God in our lives based on the lessons from Leviticus?

📖 **Passage to read**: ==Leviticus 26==

> [!info]- 🎙️Audio: [A Daily Devotional - 02.17 - EN]()  

If we think of Leviticus as a high school essay, chapter 26 would be where the writer begins to wrap things up. God is finishing up his instructions to his people with some strong, direct words and important points.

First, there’s something very important here that’s easy to overlook: the reward God wants to give His people for obeying Him. What does God want to give His faithful people? Is it land, wealth, status, or fame? No, the greatest gift—the ultimate good—is God Himself. If you look at verses 11-12 again, God says, “I will make my dwelling among you, and my soul shall not abhor you. And I will walk among you and will be your God, and you shall be my people.” The heart of everything God does for His people, all the laws He gives them, and His entire plan for them is focused on His desire to live with them as their God.

Second, we see that God gives His people a very serious warning about what will happen if they don’t obey His law and live according to His word. In verses 14-39, He warns them that, if they disobey, they will face terrible consequences: disease, famine, defeat by enemies, attacks from wild animals, exile, and more. God takes sin very seriously!

Finally, while God warns His people of the punishment they’ll face for disobedience, He also reassures them that He will never forget His covenant with them. Even in their punishment during exile, God will remember His promises. He says, “Yet for all that, when they are in the land of their enemies, I will not spurn them, neither will I abhor them so as to destroy them utterly and break my covenant with them, for I am the LORD their God” (26:44). God will judge sin because He is holy, but He will never fully and permanently reject His people.

Now, how can God both judge sin and keep His covenant with His people to bless them and never forsake them? One way: Jesus, the Son of God, took the judgment that God’s people deserved. By taking the punishment in their place, Jesus allows God to keep all of His promises. Let us praise God today and thank Him for all He has done for us through Jesus.
