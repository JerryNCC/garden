**[Scene: Lisa and Tom are decorating a classroom for a school art project.]**

**Lisa**: Tom, can you help me **build** this display stand? It’s for the kids' **art** projects.
**Tom**: Sure! Let me just finish putting up this **wall** poster.

**Lisa**: Oh, that’s a great idea. It really makes the room look colorful. Did you **choose** that **picture** yourself?
**Tom**: Yep! I found it in an old magazine. It shows a beautiful garden with lots of **plants**.

**Lisa**: Speaking of **plants**, I think we should add some real ones here. It will make the classroom feel more alive.
**Tom**: Good idea! Maybe we can ask the **kids** to help water them. They’ll love that.

**Lisa**: Totally! By the way, did you see Jenny’s painting? She used bright colors to **paint** a sunset.
**Tom**: Yeah, it’s amazing! She really knows how to **draw**.

**Lisa**: I wish I could draw like that. Every time I try, I have to **repeat** the same lines again and again.
**Tom**: Practice makes perfect, Lisa. Maybe you can take a class on **art**.

**Lisa**: That’s true. Oh, we’re running out of time! Let’s finish this stand quickly.
**Tom**: Got it! After that, we can hang some more **pictures** and clean up.

**Lisa**: Perfect! Let’s make this classroom the best-looking one in the school.
