当一位慈爱的父母结束管教孩子之后，下一步是什么？是恢复关系。你也许见过这样的情景——尤其是在年幼的孩子身上。泪水尚未干透，父母便弯下身子，张开双臂，将孩子紧紧拥入怀中。

《以西结书》一开始，是神对自己百姓的审判。他们被掳到异地——那正是以西结所在之处。随后，信息转向审判以色列四围的列国，这些国家伤害了神的百姓，并助长他们陷入罪中。然而如今，以西结开始将目光投向被掳之后的日子——那是救恩、喜乐与复兴的时刻。在第三十四章中，神透过亲自作祂百姓的牧人，显明这种复兴。

那些本应牧养以色列的领袖失败了。神说：“牧人岂不当牧养群羊吗？”（34:2）他们非但没有照顾群羊，反而自私、贪婪、严苛。那神要怎样来修复这一切呢？祂说：“看哪，我必亲自寻找我的羊，将它们寻见……我要把它们从分散的各处救出来。”（34:11-12）百姓曾落在不忠的领袖手下，如今神要亲自引导、保护、并照顾他们。

然而，神并非独自牧养他们。祂应许要设立“我的仆人大卫”作他们的牧人：“我必立一牧人治理他们，就是我的仆人大卫，他必牧养他们……我耶和华必作他们的神，我的仆人大卫必在他们中间作王。”（34:23-24）在这历史的时刻，大卫早已去世数百年。神所指的，是那位出于大卫后裔、至高的牧者——祂要与天父一同，以完全的慈爱治理百姓。

> [!important]+ 反思与回应
今天祷告求神，使你在祂和祂那伟大的牧者——主耶稣里面得享安息，即便在挫折、忧伤或艰难的日子，也信靠祂的良善与智慧的计划，带领你走人生的每一步。

### <center>He Restores My Soul</center>

> [!question]+ Review
> 1.⁠ ⁠In Ezekiel 34, why does God take the role of shepherd for His people? How is this related to the failure of Israel’s leaders at that time?
2.⁠ ⁠When God promises to appoint “My servant David” as shepherd, why would this be a significant hope for the exiled people?
3.⁠ ⁠From this passage, how can we today trust Jesus, the supreme Shepherd, in times of hardship, sorrow, or difficulty?

📖 **Passage to read**: ==Ezekiel  34.01-24==

> [!info]- 🎙️Audio: [None]()  

When a loving parent finishes disciplining a child, what’s the next step? Restoration. You’ve probably seen it—especially with younger kids. The tears are still fresh, but the parent bends down, opens their arms, and pulls the child into a warm hug.

Ezekiel begins with God’s judgment on his own people. They were sent into exile—that’s where Ezekiel himself was. Then the message moved to judgment against the nations around Israel, those who hurt God’s people and pushed them deeper into sin. But now, Ezekiel starts looking beyond the exile to a time of salvation, joy, and renewal. In chapter 34, God shows this restoration by stepping in as the shepherd of his people.

The leaders who were supposed to shepherd Israel had failed. God says, “Should not the shepherds feed the sheep?” (34:2). Instead of caring for the flock, they had been selfish, greedy, and harsh. So what would God do to fix this? He would take the role himself: “Behold, I, I myself will search for my sheep.… I will rescue them from all places where they have been scattered” (34:11–12). The people had been under unfaithful leaders, but now God himself would guide, protect, and care for them.

Yet God would not shepherd them alone. He promised to appoint “my servant David” as their shepherd: “And I will set up over them one shepherd, my servant David, and he shall feed them.… And I, the LORD, will be their God, and my servant David shall be prince among them” (34:23–24). By this time in history, David had been dead for centuries. God was pointing to a greater shepherd from David’s line—one who would rule alongside the Father in perfect love.

> [!important]+ Reflect and Respond
Pray that you would rest in God’s care and in his great shepherd, Jesus, even in days of frustration, grief, or hardship. Ask him to help you trust his goodness and his wise plan for every step of your life.
