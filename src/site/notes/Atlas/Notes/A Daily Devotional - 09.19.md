### <center>大能耶稣改变人心</center>

> [!info]- 🎙️Audio: [None]()

就在耶稣平静风浪之后，门徒们心中留下一个挥之不去的问题：“这到底是谁？”他们亲眼看见祂命令风和海，便开始疑惑，究竟有哪一处受造之物不在祂的权柄之下？

马可没有让我们多作停留。他们一上岸，就立刻迎面而来新的挑战。“有一个被污鬼附着的人从坟墓里出来迎见他”（马可福音5:2）。情节迅速展开，完全是马可一贯的写作风格。

迎见他们的这个人，和他们刚经历的风暴一样可怕。他被鬼附多年，住在坟墓之间——那是死亡与黑暗之地（5:3）。他狂野失控，拥有超乎常人的力量。人们曾多次用锁链捆绑他，他却屡次挣断（5:4）。撒但的权势使他成为自己与他人的恐惧。然而，此刻他正面对耶稣。

与船上的门徒不同，这人里面的污鬼却清楚知道耶稣是谁。他们大声喊叫说：“至高神的儿子耶稣，我们与你有什么相干？”（5:7）耶稣平静地问那人名字，鬼替他说话：“我名叫群，因为我们多的缘故。”随即，奇特的一幕发生了：这些凶恶毁灭的邪灵，开始恳求耶稣。黑暗的势力在祂脚前哀求怜悯。耶稣就准他们进入一群猪里，那群猪立刻闯下山崖，投在海里淹死——显明这些污鬼本性的毁灭与疯狂。

风波平息后，那曾被邪灵捆锁的人，竟然穿上衣服，神志清醒地站在耶稣面前。所有曾认识他的人都惊讶不已。他完全被耶稣改变了——这位能命令风浪、令撒但的军队战栗的神的儿子。

> [!important]+ 反思与回应
求神帮助我们真正认识耶稣的权能。祈求祂使我们的敬畏与崇拜日渐增长，并且像那被医治的人一样，渴慕紧随祂、无论祂引领何处都愿跟随。

### <center>Changed by Mighty Jesus</center>

> [!question]+ Review
> 1.⁠ ⁠What was the condition and strength of the man possessed by unclean spirits before meeting Jesus?
2.⁠ ⁠What did the unclean spirits say to Jesus, and what does this reveal about their knowledge of Him?
3.⁠ ⁠How did the man’s transformation after the demons were cast out demonstrate Jesus’ power?

📖 **Passage to read**: ==Mark 05.01-20==

> [!info]- 🎙️Audio: [None]()  

Right after Jesus calmed the storm, the disciples were left with a haunting question: “Who is this man?” They had just watched Him command the wind and the sea, and now they wondered if anything in creation lay outside His power.

Mark doesn’t give us time to pause. As soon as they reach the shore, a new challenge rushes toward Jesus. “Immediately there met him out of the tombs a man with an unclean spirit” (5:2). The action moves quickly, just like Mark always writes.

The man who comes to meet them is every bit as frightening as the storm they just faced. He has been possessed by demons for years, living among the tombs—a place of death and darkness (5:3). He is wild and uncontrollable, with strength beyond anything natural. People had tried to bind him with chains, but he tore them apart again and again (5:4). Satan’s grip had turned him into a terror to himself and to others. And now he stands before Jesus.

Unlike the disciples in the boat, the demons inside this man know exactly who Jesus is. They cry out, “What have you to do with me, Jesus, Son of the Most High God?” (5:7). Jesus calmly asks the man his name. The reply comes from the demons: “Legion,” for there are many of them. Then a striking scene unfolds. These evil spirits, fierce and destructive, begin to plead with Jesus. The powers of darkness beg for mercy at His feet. Jesus sends them into a herd of pigs, and the animals rush headlong into the sea and drown—a vivid picture of the demons’ deadly purpose.

When the chaos is over, the man who had been a helpless prisoner of evil stands clothed and in his right mind. Those who knew his past can hardly believe their eyes. He has been completely changed by Jesus, the Son of God who rules the wind and the waves and before whom Satan’s armies tremble.

> [!important]+ Reflect and Respond
Ask God to help you see how mighty Jesus truly is. Pray that your awe and worship would grow, and that, like the man who was healed, you would long to stay close to Him and follow wherever He leads.
