### <center>福音的大使</center>

> [!info]- 🎙️Audio: [None]()

这段经文清楚描绘了福音在一个人生命中所带来的改变。在17节中，保罗说：“若有人在基督里，他就是新造的人。旧事已过，都变成新的了。”信靠耶稣会彻底改变一个人的生命。然后在21节，我们看到这一切的实现方式：“神使那无罪的，替我们成为罪，好叫我们在他里面成为神的义。”完美无罪的耶稣担当了我们的罪，使我们得以承受他的义。这是历史上最伟大的交换。

但保罗也提醒我们，福音不仅使我们得救，也呼召我们去传扬它。那些因福音而改变的人，也被呼召去分享福音。这对保罗来说是真实的，对我们每一个信徒也应如此。当福音在我们心中生根，我们就会渴望让更多人知道这同样改变生命的好消息。

因着福音，保罗说，我们不再按肉体来看人（16节）。我们开始用神的眼光看人。凡在基督里的人都是新造的人，已与神和好。而那些尚未信靠基督的人，则是需要同样和好之道的人。所以，保罗把自己看作基督的使者，向世人传递与神和好的信息。

保罗还提醒我们，这和好的工作不仅是神为我们所做，更是神借着我们去完成的。“神……赐给我们和好的职分”（18节），并且“所以我们作基督的使者，好像神借我们劝人”（20节）。多么奇妙的思想！那位使我们与自己和好的神，现在正使用我们去邀请他人进入同样的关系。

> [!important]+ 反思与回应
你是否为神在你生命中所做的一切而感到惊叹？这种惊叹是否推动你去向别人传讲福音？祈求神赐你勇气与喜乐，成为他的使者。求他帮助你以言行活出与神和好的美好，使他人看见这份福音的美丽。

### <center>Ambassador for the Gospel</center>

> [!question]+ Review

📖 **Passage to read**: ==2 Corinthians 05.11-21==

> [!info]- 🎙️Audio: [None]()  



This passage gives one of the clearest pictures of what the gospel does in a person’s life. In verse 17, Paul says, “If anyone is in Christ, he is a new creation. The old has passed away; behold, the new has come.” Faith in Jesus changes everything. Then, in verse 21, we see how this is possible: “For our sake he made him to be sin who knew no sin, so that in him we might become the righteousness of God.” Jesus, who was perfect, took our sin so that we could receive his righteousness. There has never been a greater exchange in all of history.

But Paul also wants us to see how the gospel not only saves us but sends us. Those who have been changed by the gospel are also called to share it. This was true for Paul, and it should be true for us as well. When the gospel takes root in our hearts, we can’t help but want others to know the same good news that has changed us.

Because of the gospel, Paul says, we no longer look at people “according to the flesh” (v.16). We see them differently now—through God’s eyes. Those who are in Christ are new creations, reconciled to God. And those who are not yet in Christ are people who need that same reconciliation. So Paul sees himself as an ambassador, representing Christ to the world and bringing the message of peace with God to others.

Paul also reminds us that this work of reconciliation is not just something God did for us—it’s something he does _through_ us. “God… gave us the ministry of reconciliation” (v.18), and now “we are ambassadors for Christ, God making his appeal through us” (v.20). What an incredible thought! The same God who brought us back to himself now uses us to invite others into that same relationship.

> [!important]+ Reflect and Respond
Are you amazed by what God has done for you through Jesus Christ? Does that amazement move you to tell others about him? Pray that God would give you courage and joy as his ambassador. Ask him to help you live and speak in ways that show others the beauty of being reconciled to God through Christ.
