### <center>恩典中之恶</center>

> [!info]- 🎙️Audio: [A Daily Devotional - 01.04 - CN]()

当神创造亚当和夏娃时，他给了他们一个美好的命令：“要生养众多，充满地面”（创世记1:28）。这个命令展示了神对于人类在他创造的世界中繁衍生息的恩典意图。然而，在创世记第6章，我们开始看到亚当和夏娃的后裔人数逐渐增加——而随之而来的则是更多的邪恶。

当你阅读创世记第6章的前几节时，你可能会问：“这究竟发生了什么？”我们读到神的儿子与人的女儿结婚，并介绍了一种名为尼菲林的生物种族，他们在那时是强大的勇士。看来，神的儿子和人的女儿之间的关系是被禁止的——这可能是因为它们涉及了神的子民与不敬拜神的人之间的关系，最有可能的是涉及某种性行为的异端。尼菲林（大约可以理解为一群巨人）显然是好战、敌视神的人，强行霸占女人。

从这一段经文中可以清楚地看出：邪恶已经充斥了整个世界。第5节给出了人类生活的一个残酷总结：“他们一切意念的所思所想尽都是恶，日夜不停。”这一点深深伤害了神，因为神是圣洁的，厌恶罪恶。神许下了对罪恶的审判，宣告他将毁灭自己所创造的地与这些对抗他的背叛之人。

但是，第8节中的“然而”是一个美好的连词。在这遍地邪恶的世界中，唯有一个人在神眼中蒙恩得宠：挪亚。我们对挪亚还知道不多，尽管故事后面我们知道他并不是完美的人。挪亚有什么？他在“耶和华眼前蒙恩” (创6:8)。因为神对这一个人的恩典，也会有恩典赐给人类；神将在他对罪恶的圣洁审判中拯救一些人。

> [!important]+ 反思与回应
> 你今天是否在神面前有恩典？你是否相信了神的儿子，因为他的舍命，为你的罪使你能够在神面前有恩典？如果是这样，今天就在耶稣里安息吧！感谢神因为耶稣你在他眼中蒙恩。求神赐你力量，遵守他的道，跟随他，即使在一个背弃神的世界中。

### <center>Grace Amid Evil</center>

> [!question]+ Review
> 1. What did Adam and Eve do that made them run and hide from God?
> 2. How did Adam and Eve respond when God confronted them about their disobedience?
> 3. What promise did God give in Genesis 3:15, and how does it point to Jesus?

📖 **Passage to read**: ==Genesis 06:1-8==

> [!info]- 🎙️Audio: [A Daily Devotional - 01.04 - EN]()


When God created Adam and Eve, He gave them a wonderful command: “Be fruitful and multiply and fill the earth” (Gen. 1:28). This command reveals God’s gracious intention for humanity to increase and live in the world He had made. But in Genesis 6, we begin to see how the descendants of Adam and Eve grew in number—and with them, so did evil.

When you read the first few verses of Genesis 6, you might wonder, “What’s happening here?” We read about the sons of God marrying the daughters of men and are introduced to a race of beings called the Nephilim, who were mighty men in those days. It seems clear that the relationships between the sons of God and the daughters of men were forbidden by God—likely because they were ties between God’s people and those who didn’t worship Him, and most definitely involved some form of sexual perversion. The Nephilim (probably best understood as a race of giants) were also violent and opposed to God, taking women by force.

One thing is obvious from this passage: evil had taken over the earth. Verse 5 gives us a stark summary of human life: “Every intention of the thoughts of [man’s] heart was only evil continually.” This deeply saddens God because He is holy and detests sin. God promises judgment against sin, vowing to destroy the earth He has made, along with the people who have rebelled against Him so terribly.

But then, in verse 8, there’s a turning point. Amid all the evil, one man finds favor with God: Noah. We don’t know much about Noah at this point, though we learn later that he’s not perfect. What does Noah have? He has “favor in the eyes of the LORD” (6:8). Because of God’s grace to this one man, there will be grace for humanity; God will save some, even amidst His holy judgment against sin.

> [!important]+ Reflect and Respond
> Do you have favor—or grace—with God today? Have you put your faith in His Son, whose sacrificial death for your sins allows you to have favor with God? If so, rest in Jesus today! Thank God that you have His favor because of Jesus. Ask God for the strength to obey His word and follow Him, even in a world that has turned its back on God.
