### <center>不忠的妻子</center>

> [!info]- 🎙️Audio: [None]()

神赐给以西结一个故事，要他述说——这是以色列与祂关系的写照，也是他们背叛祂的图画。说一句“你们得罪了神”并不难，但用一个触动人心的故事来表达，却是另一回事：一位信实的丈夫，尽心施予爱与恩慈，却被他深深爱护的妻子无情背叛。

故事开头，神显出祂温柔的眷顾。祂发现以色列像个无助、被弃的婴孩，被丢下等死。她生在外邦人的世界中，浑身是血，无人顾惜。神走近她，说：“你要存活。”祂使她如田间的嫩苗渐渐茂盛，长得高大、秀美、充满生命（16:7）。神怜悯地拣选了自己的百姓，照顾他们，使他们长成完美的美丽。

接着，神向祂的百姓显出作丈夫的慈爱。在作父亲抚养他们之后，祂娶他们为妻。祂为她穿上华美的衣裳，佩戴珍宝，使她的美名传扬列邦——那美丽源于祂自己的荣光（16:11, 14）。以色列所得的祝福极其丰盛，神守尽了祂一切的应许。

然而，故事急转直下。以色列拿着神的恩赐去背叛祂。从15节到34节，以西结详述她的淫乱——拜偶像、骄傲，甚至行孩童献祭，与外邦人无异。她追逐别的情人，忘记了丈夫的爱。因此，神说祂要用她所倚靠的那些列国来审判她。她的悖逆绝非小事，就像一位深爱的妻子投奔陌生人，将丈夫的爱弃之如敝屣。

> [!important]+ 反思与回应
当你祷告时，思想自己曾如何轻看罪。为你背离神的约而求赦免。并记得——在耶稣基督里，这位信实的新郎、教会的元首，有完全的赦免。

### <center>The Story of an Unfaithful Wife</center>

> [!question]+ Review
> 1.⁠ ⁠In Ezekiel 10, why does God show Ezekiel the vision of the cherubim and the fire? What does the fire symbolize?
2.⁠ ⁠What does “the glory of the Lord departing from the temple” mean for the people of Israel? How would this challenge their view of faith?
3.⁠ ⁠From this passage, how can we avoid treating spiritual things as talismans? In practical life, how should we rely solely on Christ?

📖 **Passage to read**: ==Ezekiel  16.01-58==

> [!info]- 🎙️Audio: [None]()  


God gives Ezekiel a story to tell—a picture of Israel’s relationship with him and their rebellion against him. It’s one thing to say, “You have sinned against God.” But it’s another thing to tell a story that moves the heart: a faithful husband, giving love and kindness, only to be betrayed by the wife he has cared for so deeply.

The story begins with God’s tender care. He finds Israel like a helpless, unwanted child, left to die. Born into a pagan world, covered in blood, she has no one. God steps in and says, “Live.” He makes her grow strong, like a healthy plant in the field. She grows tall, beautiful, and full of life (16:7). God chose his people, cared for them, and brought them into full beauty.

Then God shows the love of a husband. After raising Israel like a father, he takes her as his bride. He clothes her in the finest garments, covers her with jewels, and makes her famous among the nations for her beauty—beauty that came from his own splendor (16:11, 14). Israel has been blessed beyond measure. God has kept every promise.

But the story turns. Israel takes God’s gifts and uses them to betray him. From verses 15–34, Ezekiel describes her unfaithfulness—idolatry, pride, and even child sacrifice, just like the pagan nations. She chases after other lovers. She forgets her husband’s love. So God says he will judge her, using the very nations she ran to for help. Her rebellion is no small matter. It’s like a beloved wife running after strangers, throwing her husband’s love back in his face.

> [!important]+ Reflect and Respond
As you pray, think about the ways you have taken sin lightly. Ask for forgiveness where you have turned away from God’s covenant love. And remember—full forgiveness is found in Jesus Christ, the faithful husband and head of his church.
