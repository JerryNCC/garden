### <center>被掳的以斯帖</center>

> [!info]- 🎙️Audio: [A Daily Devotional - 06.10 - CN]()

刚开始读《以斯帖记》的时候，你可能会感到有些迷惑：这卷书为什么会出现在圣经里？它讲的是波斯的一位国王和皇后——我们从未听说过这些人，也看不出这个故事和神的子民或祂的应许有何关联。那我们为什么要读亚哈随鲁王宫中的这些事情呢？

原因其实很简单：神的子民正在被掳，他们如今住在波斯。虽然故事从波斯王和皇后开始，但这仍是关于神子民的故事。所以，它属于圣经这幅大图画的一部分，也与我们息息相关。

在第一章中，我们还没有看到犹太人的出现。但这却是一个重要开端。亚哈随鲁王大摆筵席，在酒宴之中，他召唤王后瓦实提，希望向众人炫耀她的美貌，然而瓦实提拒绝了王的命令。王勃然大怒。在谋士的建议下，王废黜了瓦实提，使她永不再见王的面。故事就在这里暂告一段落：波斯王成了一个没有王后的君主。而这正是以斯帖即将登场的铺垫。

我们要记得，《以斯帖记》的时间其实早于《以斯拉记》和《尼希米记》。它带领我们回到历史更早的阶段，让我们一窥神的子民在被掳之地的生活，以及神如何在这期间保守和看顾他们——即使环境看似不确定。

《以斯帖记》最令人惊讶的地方，莫过于整卷书中竟未提及神的名字一次！但千万别误会——这仍然是一卷关于神的书。祂虽然隐藏，却始终掌权、引导、保守。正因如此，这卷书对我们特别重要。它是写给每一个在信仰路上觉得神沉默、遥远甚至隐藏的信徒。《以斯帖记》提醒我们：即便看不见神的作为、听不见祂的声音，祂依旧同在，依旧工作，为祂所爱的子民施行拯救。

> [!important]+ 反思与回应
今天，不妨花些时间来祷告。求神帮助你更深地信靠祂的看顾和主权。求祂提醒你：即使在你感受不到祂的时候，祂仍在掌权，仍在成就美善的旨意。也祷告自己能以爱与顺服的心跟随主耶稣，坚定地仰望祂。

### <center>Esther in Exile</center>

> [!question]+ Review
> 1. ⁠Why do Nehemiah and Ezra emphasize God’s word as more important than rebuilding the walls and temple?
> 2. How did the people respond after hearing the law being read aloud? How did they react to God’s word?
> 3. What is the true foundation of security for God’s people? How should we live out this security today?

📖 **Passage to read**: ==Esther 01==

> [!info]- 🎙️Audio: [A Daily Devotional - 06.10 - EN]()  

When you first start reading the book of Esther, you might wonder what’s going on. Why is this book even in the Bible? It seems like a story about a Persian king and queen—people we’ve never heard of before. It doesn’t seem connected to God’s people or his promises. So why are we reading about what’s happening in the royal palace of King Ahasuerus?

The reason is simple: God’s people are in exile. They’re living in Persia now. So even though the story starts with a Persian king and queen, this is still a story about God’s people. That means it’s part of the bigger story of the Bible—and it matters to us too.

In this first chapter, we don’t see the Jewish people yet. What we do see is the beginning of something important. King Ahasuerus throws a big feast. During the party, he calls for Queen Vashti. He wants to show her off in front of everyone. But she refuses to come. The king gets very angry. His advisors tell him to remove her as queen, so he does. He sends her away for good. That’s where the chapter ends: a king with no queen. And that sets the stage for Esther to enter the story in chapter 2.

It’s good to remember that Esther takes place before Ezra and Nehemiah. We’re going back in time to see what life was like for God’s people in exile. And we’ll see how God cared for them and kept them safe—even when things looked uncertain.

One thing that’s surprising about Esther is that it never mentions God’s name. Not once. But make no mistake—this is still a story about God. He is present, even if it’s behind the scenes. He is ruling, guiding, protecting. That’s why this book is so important. It’s for every believer who feels like God is far away. Esther reminds us that even when we can’t see him or hear him, God is still with us. He’s still working for our good.

> [!important]+ Reflect and Respond
Take some time today to pray. Ask God to help you trust his care and his rule. Ask him to show you that he’s always working, even when it’s hard to see. Pray for a heart that keeps trusting him as you follow Jesus in love and service.
