### <center>信心与拣选</center>

> [!info]- 🎙️Audio: [None]()

保罗在《罗马书》前八章中，已经详细阐明了那荣耀的福音——耶稣基督的福音。这是一份充满奇异恩典的好消息——上帝向罪人施怜悯，无论他们是犹太人，还是外邦人。  
然而，保罗自己是犹太人，他的心因着本族同胞不信耶稣是弥赛亚而深深忧伤。在《罗马书》第九章，保罗满怀痛苦地说出他的心声。他深知，单凭“犹太人的身份”并不能使人得救、蒙上帝悦纳。为什么会这样呢？

首先，因为“以色列人”并不等于“真以色列人”。从始至终，真正的上帝子民都是那些凭信心信靠祂的人，而不只是拥有特定血统的人。保罗提醒听众回顾他们的祖先——亚伯拉罕的孙子以扫。以扫虽出自应许的家族，却没有成为信心的儿女，也因此不属于属灵的亚伯拉罕之裔。

其次，保罗指出，拯救完全出于上帝主权的怜悯，而非人的出身、努力或功德。得救不是人的权利，而是上帝的拣选。保罗引用出埃及记中上帝对摩西的话说：“我要怜悯谁，就怜悯谁；要恩待谁，就恩待谁。”上帝甚至兴起法老，使他的心刚硬，为要成就祂奇妙的救赎计划，显明祂的荣耀。圣经并没有说人是毫无选择的木偶；但圣经清楚教导我们：在救恩的设计上，上帝拥有最终的主权，祂按着自己的旨意拣选人，使他们得永远的救赎。

保罗知道，这样的真理往往让人心中困惑——我们也许会问：“这难道公平吗？”但保罗的回答极为清晰：上帝是上帝，而我们不是。正确的回应，不是质疑祂的公义，而是俯伏敬拜祂的主权。真正令人震撼的事实，不是“为何不是所有人都得救”，而是“为何竟有人得救”。这是何等奇妙的恩典——上帝竟然拣选罪人，使他们得怜悯，与祂建立永远的关系。

> [!important]+ 反思与回应
若你今天信靠耶稣基督，承认祂是你的救主与主宰，你就是那蒙怜悯、被拣选的余民之一。让我们存着谦卑的心感谢上帝，因祂白白赐下的救恩。祈求祂使你更深明白祂恩典的奇妙，也更热切地向世人传扬这救赎的盼望。

📖 **Passage to read**: ==Romans 09.01-29==

> [!info]- 🎙️Audio: [None]()  

Paul has spent eight chapters unfolding the good news of Jesus Christ. It’s a message full of grace—grace that reaches sinners from every background, both Jews and Gentiles. Yet Paul himself is a Jew, and his heart is deeply burdened for his own people. In Romans 9, he speaks with sorrow about many Israelites who have not accepted Jesus as the Messiah. Still, Paul insists that being born Jewish is not enough to make someone right with God. Why not?

First, Paul explains that not everyone who belongs to Israel by birth truly belongs to God’s Israel. The true people of God have always been those who trust in him by faith, not just those with the right ancestry. Paul reminds his readers about Esau, the grandson of Abraham. Though he was part of Abraham’s family line, he was not part of the spiritual family of faith.

Second, Paul teaches that salvation depends on God’s mercy, not on human effort or ethnic heritage. It’s about God’s sovereign choice. Quoting Exodus, Paul recalls God’s words to Moses: “I will have mercy on whom I have mercy, and I will have compassion on whom I have compassion.” God also raised up Pharaoh and allowed his heart to be hardened to show his glory and fulfill his saving plan. The Bible never says that humans are puppets with no real choices, but it clearly teaches that God is the one who rules over all things—even salvation. He alone chooses to whom his saving mercy is given.

Paul knows that this truth raises questions in our minds. “Is that fair?” we might ask. But Paul’s answer is simple: God is God, and we are not. The right response is not to argue with him but to bow before him in worship. The real wonder is not that some are not saved—but that any of us are. God has shown mercy to sinners who deserved judgment, and he keeps a faithful remnant for himself.

> [!important]+ Reflect and Respond
If you trust in Jesus Christ as your Savior and Lord, you are part of that remnant. Rejoice in that truth! Give thanks with a humble heart that God chose to show mercy to you. Ask him to deepen your awe of his grace and to help you share the hope of the gospel with others.
