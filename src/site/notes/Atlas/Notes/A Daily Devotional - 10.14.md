### <center>彼得在五旬节指向耶稣</center>

> [!info]- 🎙️Audio: [None]()

讲道并不只是讲台上的一番言语，而是神向祂子民解明祂话语的方式。在今天的经文里，我们读到耶稣复活之后的第一篇讲道。藉此我们看见，神使用以基督为中心的宣讲，成就祂拯救人的计划。

想一想彼得的处境。几个星期前，他曾三次否认耶稣，如今却站在人群面前，勇敢地为基督作见证。这其中发生了什么转变呢？主赦免了他，恢复了他，又赐下圣灵的能力，使他能大胆传讲耶稣基督。这给了我们极大的盼望：既然彼得能够被恢复并重用，我们同样也能在生命中经历赦免、更新，甚至被主使用去服事。

彼得的信息有一个核心：耶稣基督就是神向祂子民所应许的一切的成全。首先，他回应那些讥笑门徒在五旬节时喝醉的人。彼得解释说，众人所见的，正是约珥先知的预言应验。神曾应许要将祂的灵浇灌“凡有血气的”（2:17），如今这一应许正在实现，神的百姓靠着圣灵的能力传扬基督。

其次，彼得强调耶稣的复活。这是证明耶稣就是基督、是神的弥赛亚、是祂子民之君王的终极凭据。大卫这位以色列的伟大君王死了，仍旧留在坟墓里；但耶稣却从死里复活，祂是永活的主，是神的独生子。彼得帮助众人看见，整本圣经都指向耶稣——祂就是核心与焦点。

最后，彼得毫不回避地指出：这位耶稣，这位神所立的弥赛亚，正是他们亲手钉死、弃绝的。听见的人心中扎心，认清了耶稣的至高主权与自己罪恶的深重，于是悔改、信靠祂。就在那一天，约有三千人加入了神的国度。

> [!important]+ 反思与回应
当我们真正遇见耶稣时，也会有同样的回应：因祂的荣耀而惊叹，为自己的罪而忧伤，并转向祂得着生命。愿我们天天如此祷告：愿惊叹基督与痛悔罪恶，成为我们回应神话语的常态。求神打开我们的眼睛，使我们更深看见祂儿子的荣耀，也更深体会十字架赦罪之恩的宝贵。

### <center>Peter Points to Jesus at Pentecost</center>

> [!question]+ Review
> 1. What supernatural events did the disciples experience at Pentecost, and what was their meaning?
> 2. Why is Acts 2 considered the key turning point for the gospel spreading from a small group to the whole world?
> 3. How does this passage remind us of the role of the Holy Spirit in our faith and mission today?

📖 **Passage to read**: ==使徒行传 02:14-41==

> [!info]- 🎙️Audio: [None]()  

Sermons are not just words from a pulpit. They are God’s way of explaining his Word to his people. In today’s passage, we hear the very first sermon after Jesus rose from the dead. Through it, we see how God uses preaching—centered on Christ—to bring salvation to people’s lives.

Think about Peter for a moment. Only a few weeks earlier, he denied Jesus three times. Now he stands before a crowd, preaching boldly about Jesus Christ. What changed? The Lord forgave him, restored him, and gave him the Spirit’s power. That gives us hope. If Peter could be restored and used, then we can find forgiveness, renewal, and strength for ministry too.

Peter’s message has one main point: Jesus Christ is the fulfillment of God’s promises to his people. First, he answers those who mocked the disciples at Pentecost, saying they were drunk. Peter explains that what they were seeing was the fulfillment of Joel’s prophecy. God had promised to pour out his Spirit “on all flesh” (2:17), and now that promise was being fulfilled as people proclaimed Christ by the Spirit’s power.

Second, Peter lifts up the resurrection of Jesus. This is the ultimate proof that Jesus is the Christ, the Messiah, the King of God’s people. Even David, the great king, died and stayed in the grave. But Jesus rose from the dead. He is the living Lord, God’s own Son. Peter helps the people see the whole Bible pointing to Jesus. He is the center of it all.

Finally, Peter does not shy away from the truth: this Jesus, the divine Messiah, was the one they crucified and rejected. The people are cut to the heart. They realize both the greatness of Jesus’s lordship and the depth of their sin. They repent and believe. That day, about three thousand people were added to God’s kingdom.

> [!important]+ Reflect and Respond
This is what happens when we encounter Jesus. We marvel at who he is. We grieve over our sin. We turn to him in faith. Let us pray that these two responses—wonder at Christ and sorrow over sin—shape our lives every day. Ask God to open your eyes to the glory of his Son and to the beauty of forgiveness through his cross.
