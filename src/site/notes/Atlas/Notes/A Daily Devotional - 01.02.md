### <center>安息之日</center>

> [!info]- 🎙️Audio: [A Daily Devotional - 01.02 CN](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1895zcGl_Lty2heaolzEYhA27DtX6D0R9/view?usp=drive_link)

《创世记》的第一章描述了神在六天内的创造工作。神只用祂大能的话语，便使万物从无到有。不仅如此，神完成了祂所计划的一切。《创世记》2章2节写道：“到第七日，神造物的工已经完毕。”在完成了创造之后，神在这一天“安息了”（创2:2），并且“赐福第七日，定为圣日”（创2:3）。

这短短三节经文揭示了一个贯穿圣经的重要主题——神的安息。这安息成为安息日的基础，是神的子民为了纪念并庆祝祂的安息而设立的一天。对于信徒来说，这传统延续为主日，成为敬拜与盼望主再来的日子。

这里有一个很有意思的细节，可能你没有注意到。在创造的前六天，每一天的结尾都有一句重复的短语：“有晚上，有早晨，这是第某日。”但当你仔细阅读《创世记》2章1到3节时，会发现第七日并没有这样的短语。圣经从未提到第七日结束了。这意味着我们现在正生活在第七日！神如今坐在天上的宝座上，处于完全的安息中。这并不表示神完全停止了工作，而是说祂已经完成了创造的工。

圣经的后续部分再次提到神的安息。在《希伯来书》中，作者引用了《创世记》2章1到3节，并写道：“这样看来，必另有一安息日的安息为神的子民存留。因为那进入神安息的，也歇了自己的工，正如神歇了他的工一样。所以，我们务必竭力进入那安息”（希4:9-11）。那么，《创世记》预表的神的安息究竟是什么呢？它是指因恩典得救的人所享有的喜乐安息，是不靠行为，而靠恩典的安息。这安息通过耶稣基督赐下，祂为你而生，也为你而死。你是否已经进入神的安息呢？

> [!important]+ 反思与回应
> 花些时间感谢神伟大的创造工。思想神如今的安息，并意识到我们正活在第七日中。求祂赐下你灵魂深处的安息，让你通过信靠祂的儿子耶稣基督，更加认识祂、跟随祂。

### <center>A Day of Rest</center>

> [!info]- 🎙️Audio: [A Daily Devotional - 01.02 EN](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1vF1PxuzSMlRo96TWVA0z9GVL_u6jZnX_/view?usp=drive_link)

The first chapter of Genesis highlights God’s work during the six days of creation. With nothing more than his powerful word, God brought everything into existence. Not only is God powerful enough to create, but he also completed all that he intended to do. Genesis 2:2 says, _“On the seventh day God finished his work that he had done.”_ After completing his work, God rested on this day and _“blessed the seventh day and made it holy”_ (2:3).

These three verses introduce a key theme that echoes throughout the Bible: God’s rest. This rest becomes the basis for the Sabbath day, a day for God’s people to remember and celebrate his rest. For followers of Jesus, this practice continues as the Lord’s Day, a day of worship and anticipation of his return.

There’s something fascinating about this passage that’s easy to miss. In the first six days of creation, each day ends with the same phrase: _“And there was evening and there was morning, the nth day.”_ But if you read Genesis 2:1–3 carefully, you’ll notice that this phrase is missing for the seventh day. The Bible never says the seventh day ended. This suggests that we are still living in the seventh day! God, seated on his throne in heaven, dwells in a state of perfect rest. This doesn’t mean God has stopped all work, but it does mean he has completed the work of creation.

The theme of God’s rest comes up again later in the Bible. The book of Hebrews refers to Genesis 2:1–3 and says, _“So then, there remains a Sabbath rest for the people of God, for whoever has entered God’s rest has also rested from his works as God did from his. Let us therefore strive to enter that rest”_ (Heb. 4:9–11). What is this rest that Genesis foreshadows? It’s the rest of salvation—joyful rest for those saved by grace, not works. This rest is available through Jesus Christ, who lived and died for you. Have you entered God’s rest?

> [!important]+ Reflection
> Take time to thank God for his magnificent work in creation. Reflect on the reality that God is now at rest and that we live in the seventh day. Ask him to give you true rest for your soul as you trust and follow Jesus Christ, his Son.
