### <center>在光中行走</center>

> [!info]- 🎙️Audio: [None]()

如今有一种流行的观念认为，真正重要的不是我们做了什么，而是我们的心是否在正确的地方。令人惊讶的是，今天的文化中，人们竟然能够在某种程度上，把道德和良善与自己实际的生活方式分开。我们从《约翰一书》中学到，这种倾向并非新鲜事。在使徒约翰的时代，那些自称属耶稣基督的人，也试图把对耶稣的知识与为他而活、过圣洁顺服生活分开。约翰非常清楚地告诉我们：我们的行为很重要。

约翰在本段经文中这样开始说明这一点：“神就是光，在他毫无黑暗；我们若说自己与他有交通，却仍在黑暗中行走，就说谎，并不实践真理”（1:5–6）。约翰讲得再清楚不过了——他在整封信中都会继续强调这一点。那些“基督徒”如果故意、习惯性地犯罪，就显示他们并不真正属于耶稣。他们的知识或良好意图无关紧要；最终，他们的生活方式证明了他们是谁。朋友，你今天是在光中行走吗？

如果你认为约翰是在推行律法主义，或在倡导“靠行为得救”，请注意他在我们读过的经文之后所说的话：“我们若说自己无罪，便是自欺，真理也不在我们心里；我们若认自己的罪，神是信实、公义的，必要赦免我们的罪，洗净我们一切的不义”（1:8–9）。约翰并不是教导基督徒必须完美，或他们在今生能够完全无罪！相反，这节经文帮助我们认识哪种罪不适合跟随耶稣的人：那就是未认的、故意的、习惯性的罪。所有悔改的人都能得到恩典、赦免和洁净！真正经历过这些的人，就不会再有意在罪中生活。

花几分钟感谢神，通过耶稣基督替我们所受的牺牲，为我们带来的赦免和洁净。然后求神帮助你在光中行走，而不是在黑暗中行走。祈求他使你的生活能反映耶稣！

📖 **Passage to read**: ==1 John 01.01-02.06==

> [!info]- 🎙️Audio: [None]()  

There is a popular sentiment today that what really matters is not what we _do_; it’s the fact that our heart was in the right place. Amazingly, people in our culture today have the ability to somehow separate morality and goodness from the actual way they are living their lives. We learn from the book of 1 John that this tendency is far from new. During the days of the apostle John, people who claimed the name of Jesus Christ sought to separate _knowledge_ about Jesus from _lives of holiness and obedience_ lived for him. John tells us very clearly: our actions matter.

Here is how John begins to make this point in this passage: “God is light, and in him is no darkness at all. If we say we have fellowship with him while we walk in darkness, we lie and do not practice the truth” (1:5–6). John could not be clearer as he makes this point—a point that he will continue to make throughout this letter. “Christians” who continue to sin intentionally and habitually are demonstrating that they do not truly belong to Jesus. Their knowledge or good intentions are irrelevant; ultimately, they prove who they are by how they live. Friend, are you walking in the light today?

In case you think John is some kind of legalist or someone pushing a “salvation by works” agenda, listen to what he says right after the verse we read: “If we say we have no sin, we deceive ourselves, and the truth is not in us. If we confess our sins, he is faithful and just to forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness” (1:8–9). John is not teaching that Christians must be perfect, or that they ever will be until heaven! Rather, this verse helps us discover what kind of sin does not fit into the life of a follower of Jesus: _unconfessed, intentional, habitual sin_. There is grace and forgiveness and cleansing for all who repent of sin! People who truly experience that, though, will not live intentionally in their sin any more.

> [!important]+ Reflect and Respond
_Spend a few minutes thanking God for his forgiveness and the cleansing we receive through the sacrificial death of Jesus Christ in our place. Then ask God to help you walk in the light, not in the darkness. Pray that he would make your life reflect Jesus!_
