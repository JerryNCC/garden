约伯的朋友们一口咬定：他的苦难必定是神对罪的审判。他们固执得几乎可笑，拒绝接受其他解释。然而，约伯坚定立场，他并非自称毫无瑕疵，而是说自己一生忠于神。你能感受到他的沮丧——身陷痛苦，还要不断与这些毫无安慰之能的朋友争辩。

在这段经文中，约伯向神和众人陈述自己的生活。他首先表明在性情上的纯洁：“我与眼睛立约，怎能恋恋不舍地注视贞女呢？”（约伯记31:1）。他谈到在生意上的诚信：“若我与虚谎同行，脚步追随诡诈……愿我播种，别人收割，我栽的被连根拔起”（约伯记31:5-8）。约伯说，他尽力公平对待仆人，尽他所能帮助穷人和有需要的人，这一切都因他对神的敬畏：“因我畏惧神的灾祸，若不如此，怎能面对祂的威严？”（约伯记31:23）。他没有贪爱钱财，也没有幸灾乐祸于仇敌的失败（约伯记31:29）。最后，他向神发出大胆的呼求：“这是我的誓言！愿全能者回应我！”（约伯记31:35）。

读到这里，我们容易觉得约伯在自夸。但他并非自我吹捧。他只是表明自己对神的忠心，坚称苦难并非因背弃神而来。约伯和我们这些跟随耶稣的人一样，远非完美——我们都是蒙恩的罪人。然而，像约伯一样，我们应当盼望有一天回顾人生时，能说自己活出了对神和祂儿子耶稣的忠信。

> [!important]+ 反思与回应
神呼召我们因耶稣得救，并靠圣灵的大能，越来越被塑造成我们救主的模样。今天，求神让你的生活日益彰显耶稣的品格。祈求你的心思、内心和身体，都带着对救主的忠信，因祂在你生命中掌权。

### <center>A Life Lived Well</center>

> [!question]+ Review
> 1. ⁠In Job 21:7, Job questions why the wicked live and grow strong. How does this challenge the perspective of his friends?  
> 2. According to Job’s observation that the wicked “spend their days in prosperity and go down to Sheol in peace” (Job 21:13), what reality does this reflect? How can we understand this phenomenon in relation to God’s justice?  
> 3. The article mentions that God’s plan extends beyond this life, pointing to Jesus’ final judgment (Matthew 25:32). How can we trust in God’s eternal plan when we see the wicked prosper?

📖 **Passage to read**: ==Job 31==

> [!info]- 🎙️Audio: [A Daily Devotional - 06.22 - EN]()  


Job’s friends keep hammering the same point: his suffering must mean God’s judging his sin. They’re stubborn, almost laughably so, refusing to see any other explanation. Job, though, holds his ground. He’s not claiming to be perfect, but he’s lived faithful to God. You can sense his frustration—already in pain, he’s got to keep arguing with these friends who turn out to be terrible comforters.

In this part of the story, Job lays out his case, speaking to God and others about his life. He starts with his commitment to purity: “I made a deal with my eyes not to stare at a woman lustfully” (31:1). He talks about being honest in business: “If I’ve ever lied or cheated, let someone else take what I’ve worked for, and let my crops get torn up” (31:5–8). Job says he’s treated his workers fairly and done all he could to help the poor, driven by a deep respect for God: “I feared God’s judgment and couldn’t face His greatness otherwise” (31:23). He hasn’t chased after money or gloated over his enemies’ failures (31:29). He wraps it up with a bold plea to God: “Here’s my mark! Let the Almighty answer me!” (31:35).

When we read this, it’s easy to think Job’s bragging. But he’s not puffing himself up. He’s just saying he’s been faithful to God and that his pain isn’t because he’s turned his back on Him. Job’s no more perfect than any of us who follow Jesus—we’re all sinners saved by grace. Still, like Job, we should aim to look back one day and see a life lived well, faithful to God and His Son, Jesus.

> [!important]+ Reflect and Respond
God calls us to be saved by Jesus and then shaped more and more into His image by the Holy Spirit’s power. Pray today that your life would show Jesus’ character more each day. Ask that your thoughts, heart, and actions would reflect faithfulness to your Savior as He works in you.
