### <center>上帝遵守他的承诺</center>

> [!info]- 🎙️Audio: [A Daily Devotional - 05.05 - CN]()

在《创世记》12:2-3中，神向亚伯兰应许说：“我必使你成为大国；我必赐福给你，使你的名为大；你也要叫别人得福……地上的万族都要因你得福。”神一直信实于他对他子民和对亚伯兰的应许。他已经将他们安置在自己的地方——耶路撒冷。他藉着他所拣选、智慧的王——所罗门，治理他们。

本章前十九节列出了在所罗门王手下服侍的人。他在国中设立了许多高官，有书记、记事官、军队的元帅，还有掌管王宫事务和服苦工的人。他也设立了一个制度，让十二位官员在全国各地担任他的代表，负责征税和供应王室的饮食。藉着神所赐的智慧，所罗门建立了一个极其有条理的治理体系。

本章其余部分描述了所罗门王所拥有的惊人财富、财宝和影响力。他的国度疆域之广，是以色列历史上空前绝后的。他拥有的财物和牲畜数量令人震惊！更重要的是，他在智慧上也极其丰富；他作箴言和诗歌，用教导使百姓得福。不仅以色列百姓因这位王的智慧而蒙福，“各国的人都来听所罗门的智慧”，甚至连别国的君王也前来（4:34）。

想象一下所罗门统治时期，一般以色列人的生活会是怎样的？这段经文从三个方面回答了这个问题。百姓“吃喝快乐”（4:20）；百姓“安然居住……一生一世”（4:25）；百姓“来听所罗门的智慧”（4:34）。这真是神子民的黄金时代！

> [!important]+ 反思与回应
如果你读过圣经，你会知道这样的君王制度不会永远持续下去；我们会看到，神的子民需要一位永恒的君王——他不仅拯救百姓脱离非利士人，更拯救他们脱离自己的罪。但今天，就让这段关于所罗门王统治的图景鼓励你的信心，在祷告中感谢神，因为他信实地履行了对亚伯兰和他子民的应许——那些曾看似不可能实现的应许。

### <center>God kept His Promise</center>

> [!question]+ Review
> 1. ⁠What did Solomon ask for in his dream? Why does this request show his godliness and humility?
> 2. ⁠How did Solomon handle the dispute between the two women over the baby? How does this story display the wisdom God gave him?
> 3. How do we see God's faithfulness to His promises in Solomon’s reign? How can we respond in faith to this faithful God today?

📖 **Passage to read**: ==1 Kings 04==

> [!info]- 🎙️Audio: [A Daily Devotional - 05.05 - EN]()  

In Genesis 12:2–3, God made this promise to Abram: “I will make of you a great nation, and I will bless you and make your name great, so that you will be a blessing.… In you all the families of the earth shall be blessed.” God has been faithful to his people and his promise. He has established them in his place, Jerusalem. He rules over them through his chosen, wise king, Solomon.

The first nineteen verses of the chapter list the people who are in service to King Solomon. He has put in place high officials over parts of his kingdom: secretaries, recorders, commanders of the army, and men in charge of palace affairs and forced labor. He has also developed a system where twelve officers serve as his representatives across the nation, overseeing a system of taxation and also providing food for the king and his royal household. Solomon, with his God-given wisdom, has put in place an incredibly well-organized system of government.

The rest of the chapter describes the incredible wealth, riches, and influence of King Solomon. His kingdom stretched farther than it ever had before, or ever would in the future. !e amount of possessions and animals he had was truly remarkable! 

More than that, he had become rich in his wisdom; he composed proverbs and songs and blessed the people with his teaching. It’s not only the people of Israel who are blessed by the king’s wisdom, though; “people of all nations came to hear the wisdom of Solomon,” even other kings (4:34).

Think of the average Israelites during the reign of Solomon. What is their experience? The passage tells us the answer to this in three ways. !e people “ate and drank and were happy” (4:20). !e people “lived in safety … all the days of Solomon” (4:25). !e people “came to hear the wisdom of Solomon” (4:34). What a time for God’s people!

> [!important]+ Reflect and Respond
If you’ve read the Bible before, you know that this human monarchy won’t last forever; it will become clear that God’s people need an eternal King—one who will save his people, not just from the Philistines, but from their own sins. But for today let this picture of Solomon’s reign encourage your faith in God as you spend some time in prayer. Thank him for his faithfulness to his promises to Abram and to his people—promises that once seemed so unlikely.
