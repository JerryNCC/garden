在旧约中，几乎所有人物都有其缺陷。即便是那些被认为是良善的神子民的君王与领袖，也难免在某些时刻跌倒。这让我们意识到，人类真正需要一位不被罪恶所玷污、不陷于堕落人性复杂性的统治者——一位将完美生活、为人牺牲，并永远掌权的救主。

所罗门的道德复杂性，虽在他的一生中愈发明显，却从起初就已显露。《列王纪上》第三章一开始，就记载了所罗门与埃及法老之女的婚姻，这是他与埃及王结盟的手段。然而，这一举动引发了人们对他品格的质疑，因为神曾吩咐祂的百姓不可与外邦通婚，为要他们专一敬拜独一的真神。

尽管如此，在《列王纪上》第三章中，所罗门仍被呈现为一位敬虔又忠诚的君王。这一形象在经文的核心事件中得到了清楚的展现。一天夜里，神在梦中向所罗门显现，要他求一个愿望。所罗门并没有求自私的利益或骄傲的成就，而是谦卑地请求神赐他智慧，愿得一颗“聪明的心”来治理百姓（3:9）。神因他的祈求而喜悦，不仅应允赐他智慧，还应许将他赐以无法衡量的财富与尊荣。

紧接着，便是那段广为人知的故事——两位妇人争夺一名婴孩。所罗门凭着智慧巧妙断案，揭示出孩子的真正母亲。这样的判断很快传遍全国，百姓对这位君王心生敬畏，所罗门的声望也随之日增。

> [!important]+ 反思与回应
我们知道，这幅有关所罗门智慧统治的美好图景并不会永久持续，但它为我们描绘出神对祂百姓最终心意的一角——那就是活在耶稣那完美、智慧的统治之下，祂将永远作王。今天，当你来到神面前祷告时，不妨默想这段所罗门的统治历史。求神帮助你满足于现今活在耶稣的掌权之下，并赐你盼望，期待那永恒中在基督王权下的生命。

### <center>God kept His Promise</center>

> [!question]+ Review
> 1. ⁠What did Solomon ask for in his dream? Why does this request show his godliness and humility?
> 2. ⁠How did Solomon handle the dispute between the two women over the baby? How does this story display the wisdom God gave him?
> 3. How do we see God's faithfulness to His promises in Solomon’s reign? How can we respond in faith to this faithful God today?

📖 **Passage to read**: ==1 Kings 04==

> [!info]- 🎙️Audio: [A Daily Devotional - 05.05 - EN]()  

In the Old Testament, nearly all figures have their flaws. Even the kings and leaders of God’s people—those who are considered good—have moments of failure. This highlights our need for a ruler who is free from the sinful complexities of fallen humanity—a Savior who will live perfectly, die sacrificially, and reign eternally.

While Solomon's moral complexities become more evident as his life progresses, they are present from the beginning. 1 Kings 3 starts with Solomon's marriage to Pharaoh's daughter, forming an alliance with Egypt. This action raises questions about Solomon's character, as God's people were instructed not to intermarry with surrounding nations to remain focused on worshiping the one true God.

Despite these shortcomings, Solomon is portrayed in 1 Kings 3 as a godly and faithful king. The central event in this passage underscores this portrayal. One night, God appears to Solomon in a dream and offers to grant him any request. Solomon, resisting selfish or prideful desires, humbly asks for wisdom to govern God's people well, requesting an "understanding mind" (3:9). God is pleased with this request and promises to grant Solomon not only wisdom but also wealth and honor beyond measure.

The well-known story of the two women disputing over a baby follows this divine encounter. Solomon devises a wise solution to determine the true mother of the child. His judgment becomes widely known, and his reputation grows as the people stand in awe of their king.

> [!important]+ Reflect and Respond
Although we know this idealized image of Solomon's reign doesn't last, it offers a glimpse of God's ultimate plan for His people—living under the perfect and wise rule of Jesus, who will reign forever. As you spend time in prayer today, reflect on Solomon's reign. Ask God to help you be content living under the rule of Jesus now and to fill you with hope for the eternal reign of King Jesus.
