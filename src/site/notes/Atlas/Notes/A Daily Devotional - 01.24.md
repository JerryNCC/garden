### <center>全心全意敬拜神</center>

> [!info]- 🎙️Audio: [A Daily Devotional - 01.24 - CN]()

自雅各与神摔跤以来，已经过去了许多时日。雅各与以扫重归于好，以扫宽恕了雅各，保全了他的性命（33:4）。雅各的家庭也在不断壮大，孩子们逐渐成长。在这段简短的经文中，我们可以观察到三个重要的方面。

首先，注意雅各在神呼召他“上伯特利去”（35:1）并在那建立祭坛时的回应。雅各立刻指示他的家人要除去其中的偶像，“外邦的神”（35:2）。这表明雅各之前并没有全心致力于引导家庭敬拜唯一的真神。他们一直持有偶像崇拜，并且受周围民族的宗教习俗影响。雅各明白，要完全跟随和服侍神，就必须从家中清除这些偶像。

其次，观察神如何在他们的旅程中保护雅各和他的家人。当他们经过不同的城市时，神使那些城市的居民心生恐惧，并没有人敢伤害他们。这显示了神随时准备保卫祂的子民，即便是一个小小的、脆弱的群体，也能免受任何敌人的侵害。

第三，注意神在11至12节中对雅各的祝福与应许。这是雅各之前从未领受过的更完全的祝福。它开始时类似于神对亚当与夏娃的命令：“生养众多”（35:11）。神在此命令这个新兴的民族——以色列，要增长繁荣。接着，神预言将从雅各的后裔中产生王者，预示着以色列未来的君主制。最后，神再次确认祂对雅各的土地应许，使雅各与亚伯拉罕、以撒一同成为这些应许的继承人。

> [!important]+ 反思与回应
雅各回应神的呼召，除去了家中所有的偶像，意识到要完全服侍神，必须全心全意地专注于祂。今天，是否有任何事物需要你放下，以便你能全心全意地敬拜神？今天就花些时间祷告，求神帮助你将耶稣置于一切之上，完全敬拜祂。

### <center>Worship God with Your Full Heart</center>

> [!question]+ Review
> 1. What does the event of Jacob wrestling with God symbolize? How did this event impact Jacob's life deeply?
> 2. After wrestling with God, what blessing and new identity did Jacob receive? What is the significance of the new name "Israel"?
> 3. In your relationship with God, have you ever struggled like Jacob? How can you let go of your own persistence and fully rely on God's blessing?

📖 **Passage to read**: ==Genesis 35:1-15==

> [!info]- 🎙️Audio: [A Daily Devotional - 01.24 - EN]()

Time has passed since Jacob wrestled with God. Jacob and Esau have reconciled, with Esau forgiving Jacob and sparing his life (33:4). Jacob’s family has grown, becoming stronger, and his children are maturing. In this brief passage, there are three important things to observe.

First, notice how Jacob responds when God calls him to “go up to Bethel” (35:1) and build an altar. Jacob immediately instructs his family to remove the idols, the “foreign gods” among them (35:2). This shows that Jacob had not been fully committed to leading his family in worshiping the one true God. They had been holding on to idol worship and the practices of the surrounding nations. Jacob understands that to follow and serve God completely, he must rid his household of these idols.

Second, observe God’s protection over Jacob and his family as they travel. As they move through different cities, God causes fear to fall on the people in those cities, and no harm comes to them. This demonstrates that God is always ready to defend His people, even a small and vulnerable group, from any danger or enemy.

Third, notice the blessing and promise God gives to Jacob in verses 11-12. This blessing is more complete than any Jacob has received before. It begins with a command similar to God’s words to Adam and Eve: “Be fruitful and multiply” (35:11). God is instructing this new nation—Israel—to grow and prosper. He then speaks of kings coming from Jacob’s line, promising that great rulers will arise, a prophecy pointing to the future monarchy of Israel. Finally, God reaffirms His promise of land to Jacob, placing him alongside Abraham and Isaac as the recipient of these promises.

> [!important]+ Reflect and Respond
Jacob responds to God’s call by removing the idols in his midst, knowing that to serve God fully, his heart must be completely devoted to Him. Today, is there anything in your life that needs to be set aside so that you can serve God alone with your whole heart? Take time today to pray, asking God to help you put Jesus above all else and worship Him fully.
