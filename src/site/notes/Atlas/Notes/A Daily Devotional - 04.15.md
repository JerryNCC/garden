当我们来到撒母耳记上第24章的事件时，已经过去了许多年，自从撒母耳秘密膏立大卫为以色列的未来之王。如今的大卫，成了扫罗王的追杀对象，过着逃亡的生活。大卫一定有过许多时刻，感到被诱惑，想要加速神为他所定的计划。如果有一个看似神所赐的机会，让大卫能够迅速结束扫罗的统治，夺取王位，那么这正是那时了。

扫罗仍旧决心杀害大卫，他带领着三千精兵，专门为了追捕大卫。然而，大卫在荒野中生活已久，熟悉这里的地形。当扫罗接近他隐藏的地方时，大卫观察着他的一举一动。出乎意料的是，扫罗进入了大卫所在的山洞，去解手！就在此时，扫罗，那个与大卫为敌的王，孤身一人，脆弱地在黑暗的洞穴中，丝毫没有察觉大卫的存在。如果有什么机会可以通过自己的手段结束扫罗的统治，那就是此时此刻。

然而，尽管这似乎是一个绝佳的机会，可以一劳永逸地结束扫罗的嫉妒和愤怒，夺取王位，大卫却选择了放弃。尽管扫罗一直在不断追杀他，尽管扫罗的生命此刻完全掌握在大卫手中，大卫却拒绝通过暴力或自我推举的方式来争取王位。大卫明白，神的时间和方法必须主宰他登基的道路，而非依靠自己的力量。

事实上，当大卫只是割下扫罗衣袍的一角时，他立刻感到内疚。他为自己做出的这一小小举动感到悔恼，哪怕这看似微不足道，可能会被视为对神所膏立之王的不敬。大卫的心意是正直的——他知道，做王的位置是神所赐的，而不是可以通过暴力夺取的。

当扫罗离开山洞，大卫揭示他所做的事情时，扫罗被深深的羞愧所打动。此时，扫罗似乎意识到自己所做之事的恶劣，他承认大卫将来必定是王，并且承认了自己的错误。然而，尽管扫罗短暂地悔改，但他的心并未发生根本性的改变。不久之后，扫罗又会继续追杀大卫。

> [!important]+ 反思与回应
今天，祈祷神帮助你的心像大卫一样。信靠神，在祂的时间和方法中完成祂的旨意。为耶稣基督的事业全力以赴，但要信任神的力量，会按照祂所计划的方式，完成祂的目的。

> [!question]+ Review
> 1. ⁠How does the friendship between David and Jonathan demonstrate selflessness and sacrifice in this passage? What can we learn from this?
> 2. How does Jonathan demonstrate his submission to God's will by laying aside his personal ambitions? What lesson does this teach us for our faith today?
> 3. How does Saul’s jealousy and hatred towards David affect his relationship with God? How can we avoid being lost in our own pride and personal desires?

📖 **Passage to read**: ==1 Samuel 24==

> [!info]- 🎙️Audio: [A Daily Devotional - 04.15 - EN]()  

By the time we reach the events of 1 Samuel 24, many years have passed since Samuel secretly anointed David as Israel’s future king. David, now a man on the run from King Saul, has been living in hiding for some time. There must have been moments when David felt tempted to speed up God’s plan for him. If there ever seemed like a moment to take action—perhaps even a God-given opportunity to strike down Saul and claim the throne—it was now.

Saul, still determined to kill David, has gathered 3,000 men for the sole purpose of hunting him down. But David, having lived in the wilderness for so long, is well-acquainted with the terrain. He watches as Saul approaches his hiding place, and in a surprising turn of events, Saul enters the cave where David is hiding, to relieve himself. Here was Saul, alone, vulnerable in a dark cave, unaware of David’s presence. If ever there was an opportunity to take the kingdom by force, this was it.

Yet, despite the chance to kill Saul and end his reign of jealousy and anger, David refuses. Even though Saul has been relentlessly pursuing David, even though Saul’s life is literally in David’s hands, David chooses not to take the throne through violence or self-promotion. David understands that God’s timing and method must govern his rise to the throne, not his own strength.

In fact, after David cuts off a piece of Saul’s robe, he is immediately filled with remorse. He regrets even that small act, that seemingly insignificant gesture that could be seen as disrespectful to the king whom God had anointed. David’s heart is in the right place—he knows that the position of king is God’s to give, not something to be seized by force. 

When Saul leaves the cave and David reveals what he has done, Saul is overcome with shame. For a moment, Saul seems to realize the evil in his actions. He admits that David will be the next king and acknowledges his own wrongdoing. But despite his brief moment of repentance, Saul’s heart does not change. Before long, he will once again seek to kill David.

> [!important]+ Reflect and Respond
 Today, pray that your heart would be like David’s. Trust that God will work out His will in your life, in His time and His way. Work tirelessly for the cause of Jesus Christ, but trust that His power will accomplish His purposes exactly as He has planned.
