### <center>普珥节的设立</center>

> [!info]- 🎙️Audio: [A Daily Devotional - 06.15 - CN]()

在《以斯帖记》第九章中，我们终于看见这段历史为何对犹太人至关重要。这段故事被记录下来、代代相传，是为了使百姓不忘记“普珥节”设立的缘由与意义。

本章开头，我们看到亚哈随鲁王如何回应犹太人的困境——以及他自己王后的处境。在上一章（《以斯帖记》第八章），王已颁令准许犹太人自卫。如今，那日子来到了。在波斯帝国各地，犹太人奋起抵抗仇敌，神赐给他们极大的胜利。在首都书珊，犹太人击杀了五百仇敌；合共，全国共计杀败七万五千人。亚哈随鲁王也下令将哈曼的十个儿子——神子民的大敌——处死。原本以为灭亡临头之时，神的百姓反得存活，并战胜了一切敌人。神完全而有力地拯救了他们。

接着，在本章后半段，普珥节正式设立。末底改此时已成为波斯的大臣，他为百姓制定此节期，以斯帖王后也加以确认。“普珥”这名源自“掣签”（pur）一词——哈曼曾掣签要定犹太人灭族的日子。如今，这个节日正是为要纪念神如何使命运翻转。因此，年复一年，犹太人都守此节。当孩子们问：“这节期为何设立？”父母会回答：“是为记念神藉以斯帖的手拯救了我们。”而《以斯帖记》这卷书，就是为了帮助他们记住这段奇妙的拯救。

就这样，这卷书到了尾声。整部书虽未提神的名字，却满载着祂的信实与主权。神并不丢弃祂的百姓，哪怕他们身在异地。祂的拯救终必临到。

> [!important]+ 反思与回应
今天，不妨花时间回顾神在你生命中的作为。求神帮助你不忘祂的信实，尤其是在十字架上的救恩——耶稣为你舍命，那是你人生中最伟大的拯救日。

### <center>Feast of Purim</center>

> [!question]+ Review
> 1. ⁠What made King Ahasuerus remember Mordecai’s loyalty? How does this show God’s hidden hand at work?
> 2. How did Haman reveal his pride and evil intentions? What spiritual lesson can we learn from his downfall?
> 3. ⁠ ⁠What steps did Esther take during the banquet to protect her people? How does her courage inspire you?

📖 **Passage to read**: ==Esther 09==

> [!info]- 🎙️Audio: [A Daily Devotional - 06.15 - EN]()  

In Esther 9, we begin to see why the story of Esther matters so much to the Jewish people. This story was written down and passed on so they would remember what the Feast of Purim is all about.

At the start of this chapter, we see how King Ahasuerus responds to what has happened to the Jews—and to his own wife. In the previous chapter (Esther 8), he gave the Jews the right to defend themselves. In chapter 9, that moment comes. All across the Persian empire, Jews rise up to fight for their lives, and God gives them a great victory. In Susa, the capital, five hundred attackers are killed. In total, seventy-five thousand enemies are defeated. The king also has the sons of Haman, the enemy of the Jews, put to death. On the day when God’s people thought they might be destroyed, they end up safe and victorious. God has saved them—completely and powerfully.

Then, in the second part of the chapter, the Feast of Purim is started. Mordecai, now a powerful leader, sets it in place. Queen Esther agrees. The name “Purim” comes from the word *pur*, which means “lot.” Haman had cast lots to decide when to destroy the Jews. So now, the people remember how God turned everything around. From then on, year after year, they would gather to celebrate. And when the children asked, “What is this feast for?” the parents would say, “It’s to remember how God saved us through Esther.” The book of Esther exists to help them remember that.

So that’s how the story ends. It’s a story full of God’s faithfulness, even when his name isn’t mentioned once. His hand is there the whole time—strong and steady. God does not forget his people, not even in exile. His salvation always comes.

> [!important]+ Reflect and Respond
Take time today to think back on God’s work in your own life. Ask him to help you remember how he’s been faithful to you—especially the greatest act of deliverance at the cross, where Jesus gave his life for you.
