### <center>真诚与忠诚地服侍祂</center>

> [!info]- 🎙️Audio: [A Daily Devotional - 03.19 - CN]()

当约书亚临终时，他特意向神的子民告别。他忠心地为他们服侍，按照神的旨意带领他们。如今，他敦促他们回应神，立下自己的约定——一个忠诚与顺服神的约。

这场约定仪式遵循了当时常见的条约模式，首先详细回顾了神对祂子民的恩典与作为。约书亚回顾了神为他们所成就的拯救工作，旨在帮助他们记住神是如何一直忠实地对待他们的。他希望他们能清楚地看到神的恩典和良善的证据。

在这一提醒之后，约书亚继续呼吁人们顺服神。人们应当回应神的恩典，顺服祂。那么这种顺服是什么样的呢？就是要“诚实和忠诚地服侍耶和华”（24:14）。意味着摒弃一切偶像，只单单敬拜神。百姓们答应会这样做。

然而，约书亚并没有轻易接受他们的承诺。他警告他们，“你们不能服侍耶和华”，指出神的忌邪和百姓们陷入罪中的倾向（24:19）。即使当他们再次宣誓效忠时，约书亚也指出，他们现在成为了自己承诺的见证人，必须对自己对神的承诺负责。

最后，神的子民进入应许之地，在一个始终活在神话语中的人领导下。土地被分配，神的子民开始了新的一章。然而，一个问题依然存在：下一代会怎样？《士师记》给出了答案。

> [!important]+ 反思与回应
像以色列的百姓一样，我们也应当与神立约——顺服祂，爱祂，单单敬拜祂。但我们必须记住，我们永远无法完美地履行我们那一方的约定。我们依然需要神为我们拯救所施下的恩典，才能在祂里面过忠诚的生活。今天，向神祷告，求祂继续在你生命中施行祂那信实的恩典，帮助你坚守与祂的约定。

### <center>Serve Him in Sincerity and Faithfulness</center>

> [!question]+ Review
> 1. What does Joshua’s reminder to cling to God's word in Joshua 23 mean for the Israelites? Why were they called to keep God’s commandments?
> 2. After recounting God's deliverance, why does Joshua emphasize the need to “hold fast to God’s word”? What special obedience does he require from the people?
> 3. In our lives today, how can we remain faithful to God's word like the Israelites and avoid being influenced by the surrounding idolatrous culture?

📖 **Passage to read**: ==Joshua 24==

> [!info]- 🎙️Audio: [A Daily Devotional - 03.18 - EN]()  

As Joshua approaches the end of his life, he takes the time to say goodbye to God’s people. He has faithfully served them, leading them according to God’s will. Now, he urges them to respond to God with their own promise—a covenant of faithfulness and obedience to the Lord.

The covenant ceremony follows the pattern of treaties common at the time, starting with a detailed reminder of God’s gracious acts toward His people. Joshua recounts God’s saving work on their behalf, aiming to help them remember how faithful God has been. He wants to make sure they see the evidence of God's goodness and grace clearly laid out before them.

After this reminder, Joshua moves on to the necessary call for obedience. The people are to obey God in response to His grace. What does this obedience look like? It means serving the Lord “in sincerity and in faithfulness” (24:14). It means putting away all idols and worshipping God alone. The people promise to do this.

But Joshua doesn’t accept their promise without a challenge. He warns them, “You are not able to serve the LORD,” pointing out God’s jealousy and the people’s tendency to fall into sin (24:19). Even when they swear their loyalty once more, Joshua notes that they are now witnesses against themselves—they are responsible for keeping their promise to God.

Finally, the people enter the promised land, led by a man who has always lived according to God’s word. The land is divided, and a new chapter begins for God’s people. But a question remains: What will happen to the next generation? The book of Judges answers that.

> [!important]+ Reflect and Respond
Like the people of Israel, we must make our own covenant with God—to obey Him, love Him, and worship Him alone. But we must also remember that we can never keep our side of the covenant perfectly. We need the same grace that God gave us for salvation to help us live faithfully with Him. Pray today, asking God to continue His faithful work in your life and to enable you to keep your covenant with Him.
