### <center>上帝预备了一个牺牲</center>

> [!info]- 🎙️Audio: [A Daily Devotional - 01.17 - CN]()


《创世纪》第22章是圣经中意义深远的一章，揭示了关于上帝的品格以及他对待子民方式的深刻真理。要理解其重要性，我们需要仔细研究这一段经文的内容。它展现了上帝一个非凡的模式：他提供了牺牲来拯救他的子民。

在亚伯拉罕的时代，周围的许多文化都实行献祭孩子的仪式。他们认为这是平息他们所敬拜的神明愤怒的必要方式。然而，真正的上帝与这些拜偶像的做法截然不同，他并没有要求他的子民献祭孩子。现在，想象一下，当上帝通过天使对亚伯拉罕说出以下指令时，亚伯拉罕会有多么震惊：“带着你的儿子，就是你独生的儿子以撒，你所爱的，往摩利亚地去，将他献为燔祭”（创世纪22:2）。尽管这个命令如此巨大，亚伯拉罕还是顺服了。这已经向我们展示了一些重要的事情——亚伯拉罕的立即顺从表明了他对上帝的信任和忠诚，即使是在面对难以想象的事情时。

你可能知道这个故事的转折点。就在亚伯拉罕即将献祭以撒时，上帝阻止了他。这是经文的核心：上帝没有让亚伯拉罕执行这一行为。上帝不要求亚伯拉罕献上孩子的生命。他所要求的是一种如此深刻的信心，以至于亚伯拉罕愿意将他的独生子献给上帝。在这一关键时刻，上帝提供了一个替代的牺牲，代替了以撒。

这个故事不仅是对信心的有力体现，也是对更伟大事情的预示。在他的神圣计划中，上帝设计了这个故事，指向几个世纪后另一个山上发生的事情：另一位父亲献上了他的儿子——他独生的儿子，他所爱的。这一次，牺牲没有被阻止。在十字架上，上帝献出了他的儿子，为我们的罪承担惩罚，成就了我们自己永远无法做到的事情。

> [!important]+ 反思与回应
上帝的模式始终如一。他为他的子民的罪提供了最终的牺牲。这段经文提醒我们上帝爱的深度，以及他为确保我们的宽恕和救赎所付出的代价。今天，请反思这一真理。也许你重新感受到了上帝对你的爱，体现在他儿子的死上。花一点时间感谢他，感谢他的恩典、他的爱，以及他对你救恩的承诺。

### <center>God Provides a Sacrifice</center>

> [!question]+ Review
>1. 

📖 **Passage to read**: ==Genesis 22==

> [!info]- 🎙️Audio: [A Daily Devotional - 01.17 - EN]()


Genesis 22 is a deeply significant chapter in the Bible, offering profound truths about God’s character and his ways with his people. To understand its importance, we need to carefully look at what happens in this passage. It reveals a remarkable pattern of God: he provides a sacrifice to save his people.

In Abraham’s time, many surrounding cultures practiced child sacrifice. They believed it was necessary to appease the wrath of their gods. But God, the true God, had set himself apart from these idolatrous practices by not requiring child sacrifice from his people. Now, imagine Abraham’s shock when God spoke to him through an angel with these instructions: “Take your son, your only son Isaac, whom you love, and go to the land of Moriah, and offer him there as a burnt offering” (Genesis 22:2). Despite the enormity of the command, Abraham obeyed. This already teaches us something significant—Abraham’s immediate response shows his trust and devotion to God, even when faced with the unimaginable.

You likely know the turning point of this story. Just as Abraham is about to sacrifice Isaac, God stops him. This is the heart of the passage: God doesn’t let Abraham go through with it. God does not require child sacrifice from Abraham. What he does demand is a faith so profound that Abraham was willing to give up his only son. At this critical moment, God provides a substitute sacrifice instead of Isaac.

This account is not only a powerful demonstration of faith but also a foreshadowing of something even greater. In his divine plan, God designed this story to point forward to another mountain, centuries later, where another Father would offer his Son—his only Son, whom he loved. This time, the sacrifice was not stopped. On the cross, God gave his Son to bear the punishment for our sins, accomplishing for us what we could never do for ourselves.

> [!important]+ Reflect and Respond
God’s pattern remains consistent. He provides the ultimate sacrifice for the sins of his people. This passage reminds us of the depth of God’s love and the lengths he went to secure our forgiveness and salvation. Reflect on this truth today. Perhaps you’ve been freshly reminded of how much God loves you, demonstrated in the death of his Son. Take a moment to thank him for his grace, his love, and his commitment to your salvation.
