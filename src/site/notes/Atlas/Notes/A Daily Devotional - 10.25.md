### <center>全备的福音带来彻底的改变</center>

> [!info]- 🎙️Audio: [None]()

保罗站在亚基帕王面前，为自己辩护。但这不只是一次个人的申诉，而是让我们看见一个重要的真理：**真正的福音，总会遭遇反对。** 在保罗的经历中，这反对来自犹太领袖。在《使徒行传》第25章，他们甚至密谋要在保罗被押往耶路撒冷的途中设伏杀害他。是什么使他们如此愤怒，以至于想要保罗的命？

答案就在耶稣基督。那些拒绝承认耶稣是弥赛亚的犹太领袖非常清楚，一旦他们承认耶稣，他们的整个生活就会被颠覆——他们赖以为生的宗教体系将终结，焦点将转向敬拜耶稣这位上帝荣耀的儿子；他们不再倚靠自己的善行得称义，而要单单仰赖上帝在基督十字架上为罪人所施的白白恩典。若保罗所传的福音是真的，他们赖以自夸的一切就都要崩塌。

这情形在今天依然如此。许多人拒绝福音，其实原因也一样——他们知道，一旦信了耶稣，生命就必须改变，是**完全的、彻底的改变**。他们必须悔改，必须放下自我主权，必须顺服基督为主。然而，人不喜欢放弃控制权。这就是为什么我们必须继续传讲那**全备的福音**——那宣告耶稣是被钉十字架的救主、是从死里复活的主；那呼召人离弃罪恶、信靠祂得救的福音。

保罗正是在法庭上忠于这福音。面对亚基帕王和非斯都，他丝毫不退缩，勇敢地宣讲耶稣复活的大能。非斯都甚至打断他说：“保罗，你疯了！”（徒26:24）而亚基帕王也不敢相信他所传的信息，与那些迫害保罗的犹太人并无不同。

你呢？你是否也像保罗一样，传讲那全备的福音？那既充满恩典、又要求人完全悔改、完全降服于基督主权的福音？当人真正接受这福音，他们的生命绝不会再一样。

今天，就求神帮助你毫不保留地传讲那全备的福音，深信神必藉此带来生命的更新与翻转。

### <center>The Whole Gospel Brings Radical Change</center>

> [!question]+ Review
> 


📖 **Passage to read**: ==使徒行传 26==

> [!info]- 🎙️Audio: [None]()  

Paul stood before King Agrippa, defending himself. But more than a personal defense, this moment shows us something crucial: the true gospel will always face opposition. In Paul’s case, that opposition came from the Jewish leaders. In Acts 25, they even plotted to ambush and kill him before his trial in Jerusalem. Why such anger toward Paul? Why did his message provoke such hatred?

The answer lies in Jesus Christ himself. The Jewish leaders who rejected Jesus as the Messiah knew what accepting him would mean. It would mean the end of their old religious system, a complete shift of focus—to worship Jesus as the Son of God. It would mean abandoning confidence in their good works and instead trusting in the unearned grace of God through the death and resurrection of Jesus. If Paul’s message were true, everything they built their lives on would collapse.

And isn’t that still true today? Many people resist the gospel for the same reason. Deep down, they know that believing in Jesus will mean change—radical, life-altering change. They will need to repent, surrender, and follow Christ as Lord. But people don’t like to give up control. That’s why we must keep sharing the full gospel—the one that declares Jesus as the crucified Savior and risen Lord, calling people both to repent of sin and to believe in him for salvation.

Paul did exactly that, even in court. Standing before Agrippa and Festus, he didn’t shrink back. He boldly preached the resurrection of Jesus, so much so that Festus interrupted him, saying, “Paul, you are out of your mind!” (Acts 26:24). Agrippa also hesitated to believe, just like the Jewish leaders who opposed Paul.

> [!important]+ Reflect and Respond
Are you sharing the same full gospel Paul preached? The gospel that offers grace freely, but also demands repentance and total surrender to Christ’s lordship? When people truly receive this gospel, their lives cannot remain the same. Pray today that you would hold nothing back—that you would speak the whole gospel, and trust God to bring real change.
