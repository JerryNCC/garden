# **July 04 -** **God Forgives and Changes Us**

Psalm 51 is a prayer by King David. He did bad things. He took another man’s wife, Bathsheba, and caused her husband, Uriah, to die. A prophet named Nathan told David his sins. David felt very sorry and prayed to God.

David says, “I know my sins” (Psalm 51:3). He does not hide them. He tells God, “Against You, I have sinned” (Psalm 51:4). This means all sin is first against God, even if it hurts others. David knows he needs God’s forgiveness.

David also prays, “Create in me a clean heart, O God” (Psalm 51:10). He wants God to forgive him and change his heart. He wants to love God more and sin less. David asks for joy in God’s love again.

We can pray like David. Jesus died on the cross to forgive our sins. We should tell God our mistakes and ask for forgiveness. We can also ask God to change our hearts to love Him more.

# **The Sorry Heart**

Tom is a boy who loves playing with his friends. One day, he takes a toy from his friend Mark without asking. Later, he lies and says he didn’t take it. Mark is sad, and Tom feels bad inside.

Tom’s mother sees him looking upset. “What’s wrong?” she asks. Tom tells her about the toy and the lie. Mother says, “Let’s read Psalm 51. King David did wrong things, but he told God he was sorry.” They read, “I know my sins” (Psalm 51:3). David asked God to forgive him and make his heart clean.

Tom thinks about David. He prays, “God, I’m sorry for taking the toy and lying. Please forgive me. Make my heart clean.” Tom feels peace. He knows Jesus died to forgive his sins.

The next day, Tom gives the toy back to Mark. “I’m sorry,” he says. Mark smiles and forgives him. Tom is happy. He prays, “Thank You, God, for forgiving me. Help me love You more.” Now, Tom tries to do what is right.
