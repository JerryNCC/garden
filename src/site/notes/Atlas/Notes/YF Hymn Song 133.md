超越眾能力 超越眾王  
超越眾全地和一切被造的  
超越眾人的智慧和道路  
是你创造宇宙和万物

超越眾王国 超越权势  
超越世人理解的奇妙知识  
超越世上的金银和财富  
没什麼比有你更富足

钉十架 被埋石洞裡  
牺牲自己 孤独地被拋弃  
像玫瑰 被践踏在地  
降低自己 因你爱我  
超越一切

Lyrics:  
  
Above all powers, above all kings,  
Above all nature and all created things,  
Above all wisdom and all the ways of man,  
You were here before the world began.  

Above all kingdoms, above all thrones,  
Above all wonders the world has ever known,  
Above all wealth and treasures of the earth,  
There's no way to measure what You're worth.  

Crucified, laid behind a stone  
You lived to die, rejected and alone.  
Like a rose trampled on the ground,  
You took the fall and thought of me,  
Above All.
