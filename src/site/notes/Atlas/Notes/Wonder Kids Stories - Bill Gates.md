**Business Magnate and Philanthropists**

> A bright young boy grew up to recognize the immense future of personal computing and changed the face of modern living many ways.

When Bill Gates was thirteen, he made his first acquaintance with computers. Bill had ‘blocked’ some time to work on his school computer, an old ‘GE model’ quite different from the sleek, portable ones of today. Using this and an electromagnetic teleprinter that allowed him to read the ‘language’ (called BASIC) he was programming in, he developed a version of ‘tic-tactoe’. This was his first computer program!

当比尔·盖茨十三岁时，他第一次接触到了计算机。比尔“预定”了一些时间来使用他学校的计算机，这是一台老式的“GE型号”，与今天的轻便电脑完全不同。他使用这台计算机和一种电磁电传打字机，能够读取他编程时所使用的“语言”（称为BASIC），并开发出了一个“井字游戏”版本。这是他的第一个计算机程序！

The computer responded with ease and it fascinated Bill. Along with a few fellow students at Lakeside School, Bill now looked to ‘block’ more computer time. This meant booking time on a computer and paying for it as well. One of their first programs led to a ‘ban’ when the company that owned the computer realized that Bill and three other friends had programmed the computer in such a way that they could have more free time on it.

计算机的响应非常流畅，这让比尔着迷。与湖滨中学的几位同学一起，比尔希望能“预定”更多的计算机使用时间。这意味着要提前预约计算机时间并支付费用。他们编写的第一个程序之一导致了一次“禁用”，因为拥有这台计算机的公司发现比尔和另外三位朋友通过编程，使得他们可以免费多使用计算机一些时间。

Bill Gates – or William Henry Gates III – was born in 1955 in Seattle, USA. His father was a lawyer, and his mother, Mary, was a teacher who worked in several organizations that were devoted to charity and helping the disadvantaged.

比尔·盖茨（全名威廉·亨利·盖茨三世）于1955年出生在美国西雅图。他的父亲是一名律师，他的母亲玛丽是一位教师，同时参与了多个致力于慈善和帮助弱势群体的组织。

Bill was an avid reader, especially of reference books. His time at Lakeside School was to prove of lasting significance. The school, seeing the interest Bill and his friends showed in computers, asked them to write a program with which high-school students could schedule their classes easily.

比尔是一个热衷阅读的人，尤其喜欢参考书籍。他在湖滨中学的经历对他的未来产生了深远的影响。这所学校看到比尔和他的朋友们对计算机表现出的兴趣后，邀请他们编写一个程序，让高中生能够更轻松地安排他们的课程表。

After school, Bill secured admission to one of America’s most prestigious universities, Harvard, intending to study law. Instead, he took maths and advanced computer science classes. In 1974, when he was nineteen, a company called MITS introduced a new ‘microcomputer’, the Altair 8800. More than ever before, Bill now wanted to work on his own dream. In 1975, he left university to start Microsoft, now one of the world’s most valuable companies. Bill and his wife, Melinda, are also passionate about philanthropy, keen to help society in every way through the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation.

高中毕业后，比尔被美国最著名的大学之一——哈佛大学录取，原本打算学习法律。但他却选择了数学和高级计算机科学课程。1974年，当他十九岁时，一家公司名为MITS推出了一种新型“微型计算机”，即Altair 8800。这激发了比尔更加专注于实现自己的梦想。1975年，他从大学退学，创立了微软公司，这家公司如今是世界上最有价值的公司之一。比尔和他的妻子梅琳达还热衷于慈善事业，通过比尔及梅琳达·盖茨基金会，努力以各种方式帮助社会。
