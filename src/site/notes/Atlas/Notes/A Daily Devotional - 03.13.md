### <center>约的记号</center>

> [!info]- 🎙️Audio: [A Daily Devotional - 03.13 - CN]()

当神的百姓站在进入应许之地的门槛时，他们面临着一个严重的问题。他们忽视了神律法中的一些部分，特别是未遵守割礼这一约的记号，似乎也没有按时守逾越节的约餐。在他们进入应许之地之前，神决定解决这一问题；祂要将祂的百姓重新带入祂与他们立约的记号和餐仪之下。

首先，神吩咐约书亚要让全体男子行割礼。这一记号代表着神的百姓和祂之间特殊的关系与身份。在第5节，我们得知在他们漫长的旷野漂流中，并不是所有以色列男子都行了割礼。因此，神指示约书亚要让百姓恢复这一约的记号，将所有男子行割礼。

其次，百姓守逾越节。看起来，和割礼一样，逾越节的约餐在旷野的岁月里并没有定期守守。如果割礼是标志着神百姓身份和特殊关系的记号，那么逾越节的约餐则是神怜悯拯救的提醒。它回顾了当初在埃及发生的第一次逾越节，当时神“越过”了标着羔羊血的以色列人家门，拯救了他们的长子免于死亡，同时击打了埃及人的长子。

在这些约的记号被重新立起之后，百姓已准备好进入应许之地。那么约书亚呢？《约书亚记》第五章最后几节描述了约书亚在耶利哥征战前与耶和华军队元帅的相遇。约书亚立刻意识到自己站在神的面前，便谦卑地脱下鞋子。神与约书亚面对面，提醒他必须崇拜、敬畏神，顺服神的话语。神的百姓的领袖必须由神引导。

> [!important]+ 反思与回应
神为祂的百姓立下了约的记号。对于我们这些新约的基督徒来说，这些记号就是洗礼和主的晚餐。洗礼使我们成为神的百姓，它是信徒在教会中的新约记号。主的晚餐则是为教会所设的逾越节，它让我们纪念耶稣基督在十字架上的救赎工作。今天就向神祈求，求祂帮助你以新的方式、更深的认识理解这些圣礼！

📖 **Passage to read**: ==Joshua 05==

> [!info]- 🎙️Audio: [A Daily Devotional - 03.13 - EN]()  

As God’s people stand at the edge of entering the promised land, there is a serious issue. They’ve neglected parts of God’s law. Specifically, they have not been practicing the covenant sign of circumcision, and it also appears they have not been keeping the covenant meal of the Passover. Before they can enter the land, God makes sure this changes; He will bring His people back under the sign and the meal of His covenant with them.

First, God commands Joshua to have all the men in the community circumcised. This sign represents the identity of God’s people and their special relationship with Him. In verse 5, we learn that this mark had not been given to all the men during the years of wandering in the wilderness. So, God instructs Joshua to bring the people back under this sign of the covenant by having all the men circumcised.

Second, the people celebrate the Passover. It seems that, like circumcision, this covenant meal had not been kept regularly during their years in the wilderness. If circumcision marked the people’s identity and their special relationship with God, then the Passover meal reminded them of God’s merciful salvation. It looked back to the first Passover in Egypt, when God “passed over” the houses of His people marked with the lamb’s blood, sparing them from the death of their firstborn while striking down the Egyptians.

With these covenant signs in place, the people are now ready to move into the land. But what about Joshua? The last verses of Joshua 5 describe his encounter with the commander of the Lord’s army before the battle of Jericho. Joshua immediately realizes he is in the presence of God and humbly removes his shoes. God confronts Joshua and reminds him of the need to worship, bow before Him, and humbly obey His word. The leader of God’s people must be led by God.

> [!important]+ Reflect and Respond
God establishes His covenant signs for His people. For us, as New Testament Christians, these signs are baptism and the Lord’s Supper. Baptism marks us as part of God’s people and is the new covenant sign for believers in the church. The Lord’s Supper, which is the Passover Feast for the church, allows us to remember the saving work of Jesus Christ on the cross. Ask God today to help you understand these sacraments in a fresh and deeper way!
