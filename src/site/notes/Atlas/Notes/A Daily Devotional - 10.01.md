### <center>重生</center>

> [!info]- 🎙️Audio: [None]()


尼哥底母熟知圣经。作为一个法利赛人，他一生都在研读旧约。然而，如今他面临一个前所未有的挑战——耶稣基督到底是谁？约翰记载这段深夜的谈话，就是要告诉我们：即便是以色列的宗教领袖，也可能终生翻阅圣经，却忽略了最核心的信息——旧约所指向的，正是神藉着祂的儿子耶稣基督带来的救恩。

当尼哥底母提出疑问时，耶稣一开口便直指救恩的本质：“人若不重生，就不能见神的国。”（约3:3）尼哥底母不解，他立刻联想到肉身的出生：人怎能再生一次呢？耶稣随即说明，他所说的不是肉体的再生，而是属灵的重生——圣灵所赐的新生命。为帮助尼哥底母明白，耶稣引用他极为熟悉的经文：以西结书36章里神应许要赐下新心与新灵，以及37章枯骨复活的异象。对尼哥底母而言，这些预言象征以色列未来的盼望；但耶稣指出，这一切的应许如今都在他身上成就。唯有藉着圣灵所赐的新生命，神的子民才能得着真正的救恩。

那么，这生命如何临到人呢？耶稣继续说：“摩西在旷野怎样举蛇，人子也必照样被举起来，叫一切信他的都得永生。”（约3:14–15）接着就是那句我们耳熟能详的话：“神爱世人，甚至将他的独生子赐给他们，叫一切信他的，不至灭亡，反得永生。”（3:16）对尼哥底母来说，这完全颠覆了他对旧约的理解。原来，枯骨复活的异象，不仅仅是以色列的复兴，而是指向神在耶稣基督里所赐的新生命与救恩。

> [!important]+ 反思与回应
最终，尼哥底母似乎真正明白了。他承认耶稣是神的儿子，并且一直跟随他，甚至在耶稣被钉十字架后，仍与亚利马太的约瑟一同前来安葬耶稣的身体。愿我们也如此祷告：求神赐给我们清晰的眼光，使我们读圣经时始终以耶稣为中心，并在他里面看见罪人唯一的盼望。

📖 **Passage to read**: ==John 02:01-12==

> [!info]- 🎙️Audio: [None]()  

Nicodemus knew his Bible well. As a Pharisee, he had spent his life studying the Old Testament. But now he faced a challenge—the person of Jesus. Who was this man? John tells us about their quiet meeting at night to show that even leaders in Israel could read Scripture all their lives and still miss its central point: the Old Testament is pointing to the great salvation God brings through his Son, Jesus Christ.

When Nicodemus first comes with his question, Jesus answers by going straight to the heart of the matter: salvation. He says, “Unless one is born again, he cannot see the kingdom of God” (John 3:3). Nicodemus doesn’t understand. He thinks only of physical birth. How could anyone be born a second time? Jesus explains that what he is speaking of is not a physical birth, but a spiritual one. It is the work of the Holy Spirit, bringing new life. To help Nicodemus see this, Jesus points back to something he knew well—Ezekiel 36, with God’s promise of cleansing and a new heart, and Ezekiel 37, the valley of dry bones. For Nicodemus, this was about Israel’s future hope. But Jesus makes it clear: the promise is fulfilled in him. True salvation, true life, comes only through this new birth of the Spirit.

But how will this life be given? Jesus answers by pointing to his own death. “As Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, so must the Son of Man be lifted up, that whoever believes in him may have eternal life” (John 3:14–15). Then come the words we know so well: “For God so loved the world, that he gave his only Son, that whoever believes in him should not perish but have eternal life” (v.16). For Nicodemus, this was a new way of seeing the old promises. The vision of dry bones was not just about Israel’s restoration—it was about the new birth, the salvation God would bring through Jesus.

> [!important]+ Reflect and Respond
In the end, it seems Nicodemus understood. He came to believe that Jesus was the Son of God. Later we see him standing with Joseph of Arimathea to help bury Jesus’s body. Pray that God would give you the same clear sight. Ask him to teach you to read your Bible with Jesus at the center, and to see in him the only hope for sinners.
