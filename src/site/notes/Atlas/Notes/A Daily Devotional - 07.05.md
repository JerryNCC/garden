### <center>要起来告诉他们</center>

> [!info]- 🎙️Audio: [A Daily Devotional - 07.05 - CN]()

神的子民常常忘记。金牛犊事件便是一例。当时，神才刚刚以极大的神迹奇事，将以色列人从埃及为奴之地拯救出来。不久，摩西上山朝见神，因久未归来，百姓竟很快忘了神的大能作为。他们铸了一只金牛犊，向它下拜敬拜，亚伦——那位大祭司——竟也参与其中！我们会忍不住问：他们怎么能这么快就忘记神所行的大事呢？

这份遗忘，或许正是亚萨写下诗篇第七十八篇的原因。这是一首历史诗篇，目的是要帮助神的子民记得祂是谁，祂做了什么，从而带出他们当有的回应。神的作为必须一代一代被反复传扬，因为人实在容易忘记。

亚萨在诗中清楚说明他的用意：要使后来的人“不忘记神的作为”（诗78:7）。因此诗中呼吁：“要起来告诉他们”（诗78:6）。我们若不主动记念、反复传讲，就容易在短时间内忘却神的信实与恩典。

整首诗描绘出一再重复的循环：神施行拯救与恩典，百姓却忘记并悖逆。神在旷野中供应他们，他们却持续埋怨；神满有恩慈，他们仍转身离开（参诗78:10, 17, 32, 56）。

然而，在这一切当中，神依然满有怜悯。“祂赦免他们的罪孽，不灭绝他们。”（诗78:38）祂没有离弃他们。诗篇的结尾提到以色列的大君王大卫，给人带来盼望，表明神仍然选择牧养祂的百姓。而大卫也预表那位更伟大的君王——耶稣基督。祂将永远掌权，并借着十字架彻底胜过罪，赐下赦罪与永生给那些常常忘记神的人。

> [!important]+ 反思与回应
所以，让我们向神祷告，求祂帮助我们记念祂。就像以色列人一样，我们也常常忘记祂的恩典。我们需要不断被提醒祂的信实与慈爱。求神使我们不忘记祂是谁，也不忘记因着耶稣的救恩，我们如今在祂面前是谁。

### <center>Arise and Tell</center>

> [!question]+ Review
> 1. Why does David say, "Against you, you only, have I sinned"? What does this reveal about the true nature of sin?
> 2. In his prayer, David not only asks for forgiveness—what else does he ask for? What does this show about his awareness of his inner condition?
> 3. How can we follow David’s example in confessing our sins and seeking a renewed spirit? What are some practical ways to live this out in daily life?

📖 **Passage to read**: ==Psalm 78==

> [!info]- 🎙️Audio: [A Daily Devotional - 07.05 - EN]()  

God’s people have always struggled to remember. One of the clearest examples is the golden calf. God had just rescued the Israelites from slavery in Egypt with amazing signs and wonders. But when Moses went up the mountain and stayed a bit longer than expected, the people quickly forgot. They made a gold calf, bowed to it, and worshiped—while Aaron, the high priest, stood by and helped. How could they forget so soon what God had done?

That kind of forgetfulness is probably what led Asaph to write Psalm 78. It’s a historical psalm. Its purpose is to help God’s people remember who God is and what he has done, so that they would respond rightly to him. God’s people need to hear the story over and over. That’s why the psalm says we must “arise and tell” the next generation (78:6). The truth about God’s mighty works must be passed down again and again—because we tend to forget.

Asaph says clearly why he writes: he wants future generations to “not forget the works of God” (78:7). And as we read through the psalm, we see the pattern: God saves and blesses, and the people forget and rebel. It happens over and over. God provides in the wilderness, and the people complain. God shows grace, and the people turn away (see 78:10, 17, 32, 56).

But through all of this, God remains merciful. “He atoned for their iniquity and did not destroy them” (78:38). He didn’t abandon them. In fact, the psalm ends with David, Israel’s great king. David’s rule points to hope, showing that God still chooses to care for his people. And David points even further—to Jesus, the King who would come to reign forever. Jesus, through his cross, would finally deal with sin once and for all. He would offer forgiveness and eternal life to people who are so prone to forget.

> [!important]+ Reflect and Respond
So ask God to help you remember. Just like Israel, we forget what God has done for us. We need reminders of his grace and his faithfulness. Pray that God would help you remember who he is and who you are because of what Jesus has done.
