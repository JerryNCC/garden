### <center>罪的终结</center>

> [!info]- 🎙️Audio: [None]()

这一段经文至少在结尾处是惊悚的。这是刻意为之！这段经文向我们展示了将结束历史的两顿筵席——一顿是你渴望参与的，另一顿是你绝不想参与的。如果画面如此生动，是因为神希望他的子民看见罪的可憎终局，以及那些属于耶稣的人所等待的盛宴。

我们首先读到的筵席是荣耀的——羔羊的婚筵。无论这是否是某一天将为所有神的子民实际发生的字面筵席，约翰异象的重点是明确的：所有被神救赎的人都将欢喜地在救主耶稣面前宴乐！那些将参与这顿筵席的人被称为有福的——他们是神的子民，是新妇，并将永远共享庆祝与敬拜。对于属于耶稣的人，这是极大的盼望之源。一日宴乐、庆祝与喜乐将临到。我们将有幸与救主同坐同餐！

然而第二顿筵席，却不那么快乐。约翰告诉我们，并非人人都被邀请参加羔羊的婚筵。所有拒绝神统治的人，将经历“神的大筵席”（19:17）。这筵席究竟是关于什么的呢？它关乎神对一切与他和他儿子交战之人的审判。当耶稣与他的子民欢喜同宴时，他也是全世界的烈怒审判者——他终将以公义与“愤怒”施行战斗（19:15）。当耶稣征服并审判他的敌人时，约翰听到天使对在空中飞翔的鸟呼喊：“来吧，为神的大筵席聚集”（19:17）。这就是经文中的第二顿筵席。这不是喜乐的宴席；这些飞鸟将吞食神敌人的肉体，因为神的公义审判借着耶稣临到他们。

> [!important]+ 反思与回应 
记住，这一切都是为我们而生动提醒——罪的终局——所有拒绝耶稣基督的人最终的结局。他们将因未归顺神这位伟大君王的统治而受审判。求神赐给你在耶稣里的盼望，好让你有朝一日能共享羔羊的婚筵。也求他提醒你这两顿筵席，好让你带着永恒的视角度过生命。

### <center>The End of Sin</center>

> [!question]+ Review

📖 **Passage to read**: ==Revelation 19.06-21==

> [!info]- 🎙️Audio: [None]()  

This passage is grotesque, at least as it concludes. It is meant to be that way! This passage shows us the two meals that will conclude history—one meal that you want to be a part of and one meal that you want nothing to do with. If the imagery is vivid, it is because God wants his people to see the ugly end of sin and the great banquet that awaits all those who belong to Jesus.

The first meal that we read about in this passage is a glorious one—the marriage supper of the Lamb. Whether or not this is a literal meal that will happen some day for all God’s people, the point of John’s vision is clear: all God’s redeemed people will feast joyfully in the presence of Jesus, their Savior! Those who will take part in this meal are called blessed—they are part of God’s people, the bride, and they will share in celebration and worship forever. For those who belong to Jesus, this is the source of great hope. A day of feasting, celebration, and joy is coming. We will get to sit and dine with our Savior!

The second meal, though, is not so happy. John tells us that not everyone will be invited to this marriage supper of the Lamb. All who reject the rule of God over them will experience the “great supper of God” (19:17). What is this supper all about? It is about God’s judgment on all who make war against him and his Son. While Jesus does sit and feast joyfully with his people, he is also the fierce judge of all the world—the one who will one day make war in righteousness and “fury” (19:15). As Jesus conquers and judges his enemies, John hears an angel cry out to the birds flying overhead: “Come, gather for the great supper of God” (19:17). Here is the second meal of the passage. This is no joyful feast; these birds will devour the flesh of God’s enemies as God’s righteous judgment falls upon them through Jesus.

> [!important]+ Reflect and Respond
_Remember that this is meant to be, for us, a vivid reminder of the end of sin—the final result of all who reject Jesus Christ. They will be judged for failing to come under the rule of God’s great King. Ask God to give you hope, in Jesus, that you will one day share in the marriage supper of the Lamb. Ask him to remind you of these two meals, so that you will live your life with eternal perspective._
