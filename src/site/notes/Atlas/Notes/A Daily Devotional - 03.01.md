### <center>聆听与遵行的喜乐</center>

> [!info]- 🎙️Audio: [A Daily Devotional - 03.01 - CN]()


摩西在这段话中总结了一个简单的核心思想：“百姓们，聆听神的话语，记住它，并每天遵行！”这就是他讲道的中心。他呼吁百姓将他们的生活建立在神的话语之上。摩西首先将顺从与生命联系在一起。他说：“现在，以色列啊，你们要听我所教训的典章和律例，并要遵行，好使你们得以活着”（4:1）。遵行神的话语不仅是明智的选择，更关乎生死。聆听并遵行神的话语带来生命，而忽视它则带来死亡。摩西信息的关键是：聆听与遵行意味着选择生命，背离则带来死亡。

摩西还提醒百姓，他们所跟随的神是独特且伟大的。律法不是冷冰冰的规章，而是来自一位与他们有着亲密关系的神——这使得他们与其他民族截然不同。摩西问百姓：“哪一个大国有像耶和华我们的神那样，凡我们求告祂的时候，祂就临近我们呢？哪一个大国有像我今天在你们面前所摆设的这全部公义的律法呢？”（4:7-8）。摩西希望百姓明白，他们不仅仅是在遵守一些规章，他们是与全宇宙唯一真神建立关系的人，神亲近他们，满有恩典和慈爱。他呼吁他们看到，遵行神的话语不是负担，而是特权。神亲近他们，这是难得的恩典。

> [!important]+ 反思与回应
当你反思这段经文时，想一想拥有神话语的机会是多么奇妙。我们手中持有的，是那位创造我们的圣洁神所传递的信息。今天，请花点时间向神祷告，求祂帮助你聆听祂的话语，并每天遵行它。

### <center>The Joy of Listening and Obeying</center>

> [!question]+ Review
> 1. Why does Moses emphasize reflecting on past failures in Deuteronomy 1-3? What does he want the Israelites to learn from it?
> 2. ⁠What is the context and purpose of Moses explaining the law in Deuteronomy 1:5? Why does Moses begin with a story instead of directly explaining the law?
> 3. ⁠How should we understand Moses' emphasis on "our only hope is to trust in God"? What does this mean for the Israelites and for us today?

📖 **Passage to read**: ==Deuteronomy 04:01-14==

> [!info]- 🎙️Audio: [A Daily Devotional - 03.01 - EN]()  

Moses sums up the message in this passage with a simple idea: “People, listen to God’s word, remember it, and obey it every day!” This is the heart of his sermon. He urges the people to build their lives on the foundation of God’s word. Moses begins by connecting obedience to life. He says: “And now, O Israel, listen to the statutes and the rules that I am teaching you, and do them, that you may live” (4:1). Obeying God’s word is not just a wise thing to do—it’s a matter of life and death. Listening and obeying God’s word leads to life. Ignoring it leads to death. The key point of Moses’ message is clear: to listen and obey is to choose life; to turn away brings death.

Moses also reminds the people of the uniqueness and greatness of the God they serve. The law is not just a cold list of rules; it is the word of a deeply personal God who has a close relationship with them—something that makes them different from any other nation. Moses asks the people: “For what great nation is there that has a god so near to it as the LORD our God is to us, whenever we call upon him? And what great nation is there, that has statutes and rules so righteous as all this law that I set before you today?” (4:7-8). Moses wants them to understand that they are not just following rules; they are in a relationship with the one true God of the universe, a God who is near to them, full of grace and love. He calls them to see that obeying God’s word is not a burden but a privilege. They have the rare gift of being close to God.

> [!important]+ Reflect and Respond
As you reflect on this passage, think about how incredible it is to have access to God’s word. We hold in our hands the message from the holy God who made us. Take a moment to pray to God, asking Him to help you listen to His word and follow it every day.
