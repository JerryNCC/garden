### <center>外邦人得以完全被接纳</center>

> [!info]- 🎙️Audio: [None]()

《使徒行传》第十章的开始，记载了两个人各自从神那里得到的异象。这两人素未谋面，却因神的安排而相遇。一个是哥尼流——一位敬畏神的罗马百夫长，是外邦人；另一个是彼得——耶稣的门徒。哥尼流在异象中听见天使吩咐他去请彼得来。而与此同时，彼得在屋顶上休息时，也看见了一个奇特的异象：天上有一块大布降下来，里面有各样走兽、昆虫与飞鸟，其中有些按犹太律法是“不洁净”的。随后，有声音对他说：“彼得，起来，宰了吃吧。”彼得连忙拒绝，说自己从未吃过任何不洁净之物。异象就此结束，令他百思不得其解。

直到哥尼流派来的人来到他家门口，彼得才渐渐明白那异象的真正含义。原来，这异象并不是关于食物，而是关于人。神在教导彼得：祂的恩典远超过人所能想象。那些原本被视为局外人的外邦人，如今也要因信耶稣基督而被接纳，成为神家里的人。彼得顺从圣灵的带领，前去见哥尼流。当他向哥尼流一家讲论耶稣时，圣灵降临在他们身上，就如同当初五旬节时降临在犹太信徒身上一样。彼得见此情景，心中充满喜乐，随即为哥尼流和他全家施洗，承认他们同样是神所拣选的子民。

这一刻，成为教会历史的转折点。神藉此显明，进入祂的家不再取决于种族、仪式或献祭，而是唯独凭着对耶稣基督的信心。那降在犹太信徒身上的同一位圣灵，也临到外邦信徒，使他们在基督里成为一个身体。

我们不该把这件事视为理所当然。像哥尼流一样，我们本是局外人，不属于神的约民。但如今因着耶稣基督的救赎与圣灵的恩赐，我们得以被接纳，成为神的儿女。我们与亚伯拉罕、摩西、大卫——以及哥尼流——一同站在神的恩典之下，被拯救、被接纳。

> [!important]+ 反思与回应
《使徒行传》第十章向我们揭示了神的心意——祂渴望万民都能进入祂的国度。藉着祂儿子一次永远的牺牲之死，祂为我们——为所有外邦人——开了一条归向祂的路。今天，让我们满怀感恩地称颂祂：感谢神的恩典临到我们，使我们也能与犹太人、外邦人一同在祂的宝座前，敬拜那位为我们被杀的羔羊——耶稣基督。

📖 **Passage to read**: ==使徒行传 10==

> [!info]- 🎙️Audio: [None]()  

Acts 10 begins with two visions from God. Two men who have never met—Cornelius and Peter—each receive a message that will change the future of the church. Cornelius is a Roman centurion, a Gentile who fears God. In his vision, an angel tells him to send for a man named Peter. Meanwhile, Peter has his own strange vision. While resting on a rooftop, he sees a large sheet lowered from heaven, filled with all kinds of animals—some clean, others unclean according to Jewish law. Then a voice tells him to get up, kill, and eat. Peter refuses, insisting that he has never eaten anything unclean. The vision ends, leaving him puzzled.

Only later, when Cornelius’s messengers arrive, does Peter begin to understand. The vision wasn’t really about food—it was about people. God was teaching Peter that His grace is bigger than Peter imagined. Gentiles, who had long been considered outsiders, were now being welcomed into God’s family through faith in Jesus Christ. When Peter visits Cornelius, he sees this truth firsthand: the Holy Spirit falls on these Gentile believers just as He had on the Jews at Pentecost. Peter can only rejoice. He baptizes Cornelius and his household, recognizing that God is building one people—Jew and Gentile alike—through the gospel.

This moment changes everything. God is showing that entry into His family is no longer marked by ethnic identity, old rituals, or sacrifices, but by faith in Jesus alone. The same Spirit who filled Jewish believers now fills Gentiles too. Together, they form one body in Christ.

We should never overlook how wonderful this is. Like Cornelius, we too were outsiders. We did not belong to God’s covenant people by birth, yet through faith in Jesus and the gift of the Holy Spirit, we have been brought in. We now stand beside Abraham, Moses, David—and Cornelius—redeemed and accepted as God’s children.

> [!important]+ Reflect and Respond
Acts 10 reveals God’s heart for the nations. His love reaches beyond every boundary. Through the death and resurrection of His Son, He has opened the door for all people to come in. So today, thank God that His grace has reached you. Praise Him that one day, people from every tribe and nation—Jew and Gentile together—will stand before His throne, worshiping the Lamb who was slain.
