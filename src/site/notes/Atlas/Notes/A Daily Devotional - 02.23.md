### <center>神百姓的中保</center>

> [!info]- 🎙️Audio: [A Daily Devotional - 02.23 - CN]()


在第十三章中，十二位探子带回了关于应许之地的报告。大多数探子因恐惧而退缩，导致百姓开始哭泣、抱怨，并最终反叛。最终，他们的回应引发了一句令人震惊且罪恶的宣言：“让我们选一个领袖，回埃及去吧”（14:4）。这是一种严重的叛逆行为，其中有两个关键原因。首先，百姓拒绝了神所选的领袖摩西；其次，他们拒绝了神从埃及奴役中救赎他们的恩典与拯救。

在这场叛逆中，有两位男子——迦勒和约书亚——坚定地站在信仰之上。这两位勇敢而敬虔的男子无法容忍这种罪恶的言论，他们提醒百姓，尽管面临挑战，神依然打算将这片地赐给他们。然而，百姓不仅不听从他们的话，反而试图用石头打死他们。

接下来发生的事情，也许让我们难以完全理解。神的荣耀显现，祂的同在彰显出来。看起来，神准备因百姓缺乏信心和叛逆而惩罚他们。然而，神对他们罪行的回应并非毁灭，而是施行怜悯。摩西站出来，代百姓向神祈求，他充当了神和百姓之间的中保。摩西的祷告最终以这句话结束：“求你照着你极大的慈爱，赦免这百姓的罪孽”（14:19）。摩西呼求神根据祂的慈爱和本性宽恕百姓，神听了摩西的祷告，便赦免了他们。

然而，这并不意味着他们的罪行没有后果。神告诉摩西，那些叛逆的世代将无法进入应许之地。带回恶性报告的十位探子立即因瘟疫死去。尽管神赦免了百姓，但祂仍然因他们的罪行而施行了惩罚。

然而，即使在他们犯罪的时候，神并没有抛弃祂的百姓。摩西作为中保，替百姓代求，神也回应了摩西的祷告。神的怜悯战胜了祂的审判，祂没有放弃这群固执、叛逆的百姓。

> [!important]+ 反思与回应
耶稣比摩西更加完美地站在罪人与圣洁的神之间，为我们代求，向神呼求怜悯。如果你相信耶稣是你的救主和主宰，那么祂就是你的中保。神不会按照你的罪行审判你，因为耶稣为你站在了罪的审判之地。感谢神差遣祂的儿子，赞美耶稣作为完美且最终的中保。

### <center>A Mediator for God’s People</center>

> [!question]+ Review
> 1.⁠ ⁠Why were the majority of the spies afraid of the land of Canaan, and what was the people's reaction?  
> 2.⁠ ⁠Why did Caleb firmly believe that God would give the Israelites victory? What is the significance of his words?
> 3.⁠ ⁠How can we avoid doubting God's power and promises like the spies did because of fear?

📖 **Passage to read**: ==Numbers 14==

> [!info]- 🎙️Audio: [A Daily Devotional - 02.23 - EN]()  

In chapter 13, the twelve spies give their report on the promised land. The majority of the spies are fearful, and as a result, the people begin to cry, complain, and rebel. Their response leads to an astonishingly sinful declaration: “Let us choose a leader and go back to Egypt” (14:4). This is a serious act of rebellion, and there are two key reasons for this. First, the people are rejecting God’s chosen leader, Moses. Second, they are rejecting the very salvation that God provided by rescuing them from slavery in Egypt. 

In the midst of this rebellion, two men—Caleb and Joshua—stand firm in their faith. These men are courageous and godly, and they cannot tolerate such sinful talk. They remind the people that God intends to give them the land, no matter how difficult it may seem. But instead of heeding their words, the people try to stone them.

What happens next may be hard for us to fully understand. The glory of God appears, and God’s presence is made known. It seems as though He is ready to punish the people for their lack of faith and their rebellion. And yet, God’s response to their sin is not destruction, but mercy. Moses steps in and pleads on behalf of the people. He acts as a mediator between the people and God. Moses’s prayer to God culminates with these words: “Please pardon the iniquity of this people, according to the greatness of your steadfast love” (14:19). Moses appeals to God’s love and character to forgive the people. And God listens to Moses and forgives them.

However, this does not mean there are no consequences for their sin. God tells Moses that the generation that rebelled will not enter the promised land. The ten spies who gave the negative report die immediately from a plague. Even though God forgives the people, He still punishes them for their sin. 

Yet, even in their sin, God does not abandon His people. Moses, as a mediator, intercedes on their behalf, and God answers Moses’s prayer. God’s mercy triumphs over His judgment, and He does not give up on the stubborn, rebellious people.

> [!important]+ Reflect and Respond
 Jesus, in a far greater way than Moses, stands in the gap between sinful people and a holy God. He pleads on our behalf and offers mercy to all who believe in Him. If you believe in Jesus as your Savior and Lord, then He is your mediator. God will not judge you as your sins deserve because Jesus stands in your place. Thank God for sending His Son. Praise Jesus for being the perfect and final mediator.
