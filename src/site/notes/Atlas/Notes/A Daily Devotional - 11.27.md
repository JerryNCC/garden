提摩太后书确切写作的时间虽不完全确定，但很可能是在保罗生命的末期。此时，他被囚在罗马监狱，极可能正等待面对死刑。保罗深知自己的生命即将结束，于是写下这封信给年轻的门徒提摩太。这是保罗留给提摩太的最后叮咛，我们可以想象，提摩太接到这封信时，会多么认真地对待导师的每一句话。

保罗开篇提醒提摩太，他所拥有的信仰，是一份宝贵的家庭传承。他提到提摩太“由心存的真信”（1:5），这信心至少部分来自他生命中几位敬虔的女性——祖母罗以和母亲以尼基。提摩太像我们许多人一样，有幸在认识耶稣的人群中成长，接受福音教导。他个人也信靠耶稣，如今成为福音的教师和传道人。

正因提摩太有这样的背景与福音信心，保罗接着给他一个命令：“我因此提醒你，要把神借我按手所赐你里头的恩赐，再如火挑旺起来”（1:6）。这节经文虽然曾被不同理解，但其意思很简单：保罗鼓励提摩太，要在讲道和教导神话语的能力与信心上不断成长。按手的行为是提摩太受牧师职分的象征。保罗的意思很清楚：提摩太要在基督里成长，忠心地作神的仆人，教导并传扬福音。

在信中大部分内容，保罗都围绕这一主题。他呼吁提摩太在福音上坚持忍耐；督促他紧守神的话语真理，不受各样反对的动摇；他吩咐提摩太，无论环境如何，都要忠心传讲神的话。

即便你不是在基督徒家庭中长大，神也赐给你一份信仰的传承。有人在属灵上栽培你，你也蒙召去延续这份福音传承。感谢神，感恩那些曾指引你认识耶稣的人，并祈求神帮助你，也将这福音传递给他人，使你成为福音的延续者。

📖 **Passage to read**: ==2 Timothy 01==

> [!info]- 🎙️Audio: [None]()  

We are not certain exactly when Paul wrote 2 Timothy, but it was near the end of his life. He wrote it from a Roman prison, most likely awaiting execution. Paul knew his time was short, and as he prepared to face the end, he wrote one final letter to his young protégé, Timothy. We can imagine how deeply Timothy would have taken these words from his beloved mentor.

Paul begins by reminding Timothy of the faith that runs in his family. He points to Timothy’s “sincere faith” (1:5), a faith nurtured at least in part by godly women in his life: his grandmother Lois and his mother Eunice. Timothy, like many of us, had the privilege of growing up surrounded by people who knew Jesus and taught him the gospel. He came to believe in Jesus personally and now serves as a teacher and preacher of the good news.

Because of Timothy’s background and his faith in the gospel, Paul issues a command: “I remind you to fan into flame the gift of God, which is in you through the laying on of my hands” (1:6). While this verse has been discussed in many ways, its meaning is simple. Paul is encouraging Timothy to grow in ability and confidence as a preacher of God’s Word. The laying on of hands refers to Timothy’s ordination as a pastor. Paul’s point is clear: Timothy is to grow as a servant of Christ, faithfully teaching and preaching the gospel.

For most of the letter, Paul will return to this theme. He calls Timothy to endurance in the gospel. He urges him to stick closely to the truth of God’s Word, even in the face of opposition. He charges Timothy to preach God’s Word no matter what happens.

> [!important]+ Reflect and Respond
Even if you did not grow up in a Christian home, God has given you a legacy of faith. People have invested in your spiritual life, and you are called to carry on that legacy. Take time to thank God for those who have pointed you to Jesus. Ask him to help you continue that legacy by pointing others to the Savior as well.
