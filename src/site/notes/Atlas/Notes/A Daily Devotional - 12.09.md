### <center>流亡中的盼望与圣洁</center>

> [!info]- 🎙️Audio: [None]()


想一想，我们每天做的许多事情，都是出于想要“融入群体”的动机。想想你穿的衣服，或者你说话的方式。那么，当彼得在这封信的开头写道“被拣选的寄居者”（1:1）时，这应该会让我们感到惊讶——这些人不是在自己的家中，不属于他们所在的地方。很可能，彼得在这里指的是严格属灵的意义。他写信给这些因与耶稣基督有关系而成为寄居者的人——社会上的不合群者和被排斥者。他们可能不是真正被放逐的人，但属灵意义上，他们远离了真正的家。因为信靠基督，这个世界对他们来说已变得不舒适、陌生；他们再也不属于这里了！那么，彼得对这些被拣选的寄居者说了什么呢？

彼得呼召这些受苦的人过圣洁的生活。为耶稣受苦并不意味着对顺服采取悠闲态度！彼得写信给的这些属灵寄居者，似乎需要鼓励，继续在耶稣——他们的救主——里追求圣洁的生活。看看他写给他们的话：“不要效法从前蒙昧时的私欲，总要像那召你们的圣者一样，你们在一切行为上也要圣洁。”（1:14–15）对耶稣基督的信徒而言，**追求圣洁的呼召是不可避免的！**想想你的生活，你是否热切追求圣洁——分离出来、顺服的生活——为了荣耀你的救主，即使在艰难时期？

其次，彼得呼召这些寄居者怀抱伟大的永恒盼望。虽然追求圣洁的呼召像是一记警钟——一种劝勉——但这种呼召最终以一个伟大的盼望为衡量标准，这是彼得提醒听众的。即便在受苦中，属灵寄居者有怎样的盼望？那就是借着对耶稣基督的信心所拥有的**“活泼的盼望”（1:3）**——“在天上为你们存留、不能朽坏、不能玷污、也不衰残的基业”（1:4）。跟随耶稣的呼召，是与他同受苦的呼召，同时也是通向荣耀永恒盼望的呼召。彼得希望受苦的人在追求圣洁时，不要失去这伟大的盼望！

> [!important]+ 反思与回应
今天求神，使你更加热切地追求圣洁、顺服，并在他的道上忠心——不是出于律法式的动机（为了赢得他的喜悦），而是作为回应他救赎恩典的正确反应。祈求他帮助你，即便在挣扎中，也能坚定地将盼望牢牢放在将来的奖赏上，与耶稣一同期待永恒的荣耀。

### <center>Hope and Holiness amid Exile</center>

> [!question]+ Review
> 

📖 **Passage to read**: ==1 Peter 01==

> [!info]- 🎙️Audio: [None]()  

Think about how many things we do every day that are motivated by wanting to fit in. Think about the clothes you wear or the way you talk. The way Peter begins this letter should come as a surprise to us, then; he writes to “elect exiles” (1:1), people who are not at home, people who don’t belong where they are. Most likely, Peter has a strictly _spiritual_ meaning in mind here. He writes to people who are exiles—social misfits and outcasts—because of a relationship with Jesus Christ. They may not be literal exiles, but spiritually speaking they are far from their true home. This world has become an uncomfortable, foreign place for them because of their faith in Christ; they no longer fit in here! What does Peter have to say to these elect exiles?

Peter calls these suffering people to lives of holiness. Suffering for Jesus does not imply a laid-back approach to obedience! The spiritual exiles to whom Peter writes seem to need encouragement to keep on pursuing holy lives in Jesus, their Savior. See what he writes to them: “Do not be conformed to the passions of your former ignorance, but as he who called you is holy, you also be holy in all your conduct” (1:14–15). The call to holiness for believers in Jesus Christ is unavoidable! Think about your life. Are you passionate about pursuing holiness—set apart, obedient living—for the glory of your Savior, even in hard times?

Second, Peter calls these exiles to a great eternal hope. While the call to holiness is a kick-in-the-pants kind of call—an _exhortation_—this call will ultimately be measured by a great source of hope, about which Peter reminds his audience. What’s the hope that spiritual exiles have, even in the midst of suffering? It’s the “living hope” (1:3) that we have through faith in Jesus Christ—the “inheritance that is imperishable, undefiled, and unfading, kept in heaven” for us (1:4). The call to follow Jesus is a call to suffer with him, but it is a call to glorious eternal hope as well. Peter wants suffering people to pursue holiness without losing this great hope!

> [!important]+ Reflect and Respond
_Ask God today to make you even more passionate about pursuing holiness, obedience, and faithfulness to his word—not with legalistic motivation (to earn favor with him) but as the right response to his saving grace. Pray that he would help you keep your hope firmly fixed on the future reward, with Jesus, even in the midst of struggle._
