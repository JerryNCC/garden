### <center>忠于神的话语</center>

> [!info]- 🎙️Audio: [None]()


你是否曾被要求去做一件非常困难的事——尤其是那种与你切身相关的事？这正是耶利米所经历的。神呼召他对自己的同胞发言，宣告神因他们的罪而发怒。你可以想象这有多么艰难。耶利米第一反应就是退缩：“主耶和华啊，我不知怎样说，因为我是年幼的。”（1:6）但神并没有因此放他一马。事实上，神早在他出生以前就已经拣选了他：“我已派你作列国的先知。”（1:5）

耶利米就像以赛亚一样，被差遣向神的百姓传达神的话语。他在几位王的在位期间事奉，直到耶路撒冷被巴比伦攻陷。他是被掳前的先知——一个奉命警告神百姓即将来临审判的人。而他所要传讲的信息，并不好听。

神告诉耶利米，从北方而来的列国已经联手，准备出征耶路撒冷。结果对以色列来说将是灾难性的。百姓会被击败，城池将被毁灭。为何会如此？因为他们犯罪了。神说：“他们向别神烧香，敬拜自己手所造的。”（1:16）百姓已经转离了真神，悖逆了祂。如今，审判即将临到。这就是耶利米必须传递的艰难信息。

当然，我们不是耶利米。但神如今仍然呼召我们要忠心——无论在生活中、言语中，即使面对艰难，也要活出祂的话语。这种情况可能发生在学校、工作场所，甚至在我们自己的家庭中。年龄不是问题，关键在于我们是否属于神。若是，我们就能在祂所摆放我们的每一个地方，为祂而活、为祂发声。

> [!important]+ 反思与回应
求神帮助你，即便在困难中也能持守忠心。求祂帮助你爱祂胜过一切，将祂放在首位。

### <center>Faithful to the Word</center>

> [!question]+ Review
> 1. ⁠How does God actively reveal Himself in Isaiah 65:1–2? How does this image reshape the way we think about Him?
> 2. ⁠Why did the people of Israel fail to respond to God's grace? What lessons does their response teach us about our own walk of faith today?
> 3. How does this passage reflect the balance between God’s judgment and mercy? How should we respond to His invitation in faith?

📖 **Passage to read**: ==Isaiah 65==

> [!info]- 🎙️Audio: [None]()  

Have you ever been asked to do something really hard—especially when it hits close to home? That’s what happens to Jeremiah. God calls him to speak to his own people, to tell them that God is angry with their sin. You can imagine how hard that would be. Jeremiah’s first instinct is to back away. “I don’t know how to speak; I’m only a youth,” he says (1:6). But God doesn’t let him off the hook. God had already chosen Jeremiah, long before he was even born. “I appointed you a prophet to the nations,” God says (1:5).

Jeremiah, like Isaiah before him, is sent to bring God’s word to his people. He serves under several kings, and his ministry lasts all the way up until Jerusalem falls to Babylon. He’s a prophet before the exile—a man sent to warn God’s people of what’s coming. And the message isn’t easy to hear.

God tells Jeremiah that the kingdoms of the north are coming together for war. They’re going to attack Jerusalem. And it won’t end well for Israel. The people will be defeated and their city destroyed. Why? Because they’ve sinned. God says, “They have made offerings to other gods and worshiped the works of their own hands” (1:16). The people have turned away from God. They’ve rebelled. Now judgment is on the way. That’s the hard word Jeremiah has to deliver.

Of course, we’re not Jeremiah. But God still calls us to be faithful—to live and speak his word, even when it’s not easy. That can happen in school, at work, or even in our own homes. Age doesn’t matter. What matters is that we belong to God. And if we do, we can live and speak for him wherever he puts us.

> [!important]+ Reflect and Respond
Ask God to help you stay faithful, even when it’s hard. Ask him to help you love him first, more than anything else.
