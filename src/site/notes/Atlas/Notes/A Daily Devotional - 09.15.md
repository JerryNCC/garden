### <center>十字架的痛苦</center>

> [!info]- 🎙️Audio: [None]()

马太向我们叙述耶稣受死时那极其痛苦的情景。他写道：“他们就把他钉在十字架上”（27:35），却没有多作描写。但当时的读者都清楚这意味着什么。十字架是罗马人最残酷的刑罚，专为带来极大的痛苦而设计。铁钉穿透手脚，被钉的人必须一次又一次用被钉的手脚撑起身体才能呼吸。死亡往往需要数小时，直到他再也无力撑起身体，无法呼吸而断气。

然而，马太要我们看见更深的事实。肉体的折磨固然可怕，但灵里的痛苦更加深重。我们从耶稣向父的呼喊听见这一点：“我的　神，我的　神，为什么离弃我？”（27:46）那一刻，耶稣承担了上帝向罪发烈怒的重担。父转脸不顾，好像对待罪人一般对待他。那与父隔绝的痛苦，远胜过铁钉所带来的疼痛。

马太也清楚地表明，耶稣确实死了。他大声喊叫之后，“便将灵魂交付了”（27:50）。有一个名叫约瑟的人取下耶稣的身体，将它安葬。毫无疑问——耶稣真的死了。上帝的儿子真正进入了死亡，为我们的罪完全付上代价，毫无保留。

这场死亡震动了全地。就在耶稣断气之后，殿里的幔子从上到下裂为两半，大地震动，坟墓开了，死人出来显现。这一切都表明，这不是一场普通的死亡。那无瑕疵的羔羊被杀，他的牺牲意味着凡信靠他的人都可以逃避上帝的审判。

> [!important]+ 反思与回应
在十字架上，耶稣成就了我们永远无法成就的事。他承受了上帝向罪发的全部忿怒，使一切信靠他的人不再面对那审判。为此，再次向耶稣献上感恩吧！记念他在十字架上为你成就的一切。

### <center>The Agony of the Cross</center>

> [!question]+ Review
> 1.⁠ ⁠How did the different people (religious leaders, Peter, Judas, the crowd, Pilate, and the soldiers) respond to Jesus on his way to the cross?
2.⁠ ⁠How does Matthew use these responses to show humanity’s ongoing attitude toward God?
3.⁠ ⁠How does this article explain that Jesus is the only true hero?

📖 **Passage to read**: ==Matthew 27:32-66==

> [!info]- 🎙️Audio: [None]()  


Matthew tells us about the terrible suffering Jesus faced as he died. When he writes, “They had crucified him” (27:35), he doesn’t give many details. But his first readers knew exactly what crucifixion meant. It was the Romans’ cruelest form of execution, designed to cause the greatest pain. Nails were driven through the hands and feet. To breathe, the victim had to push up on those nails again and again. Death came slowly, often after hours, when the person could no longer pull up to breathe.

But Matthew wants us to see something deeper. The physical torture was awful, but the spiritual suffering was even greater. We hear it in Jesus’ cry to the Father: “My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?” (27:46). In that moment, Jesus felt the weight of God’s wrath against sin. The Father turned away and treated him as if he were a sinner. The pain of that broken fellowship was far worse than the nails.

Matthew makes it clear that Jesus truly died. After a loud cry, he “yielded up his spirit” (27:50). Joseph took the body and buried it. There was no doubt—Jesus was dead. The Son of God really entered death itself. He paid the full penalty for our sin, holding nothing back.

And this death shook the world. Right after Jesus died, the temple curtain tore from top to bottom. The earth quaked. Tombs opened and the dead came out. These signs tell us this was no ordinary death. The perfect Lamb had been killed. His sacrifice means that all who trust him are safe from God’s judgment.

> [!important]+ Reflect and Respond
On the cross, Jesus did what we could never do. He bore the full force of God’s wrath so that those who believe in him will never face it themselves. Give thanks to Jesus for going to the cross. Remember what he finished there—for you.
