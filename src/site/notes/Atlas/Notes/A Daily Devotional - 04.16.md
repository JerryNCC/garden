> 1. ⁠大卫在山洞中的决定反映了他如何顺服神的计划，而非依靠自己的力量？这种顺服心态对于我们生活中遇到类似诱惑时有何启示？
> 2. 大卫在割下扫罗衣袍的一角后感到内疚，他的悔恼显示了什么？这对我们如何看待与神所立之权威的关系有何启示？
> 3. 扫罗在大卫揭示自己所做的事情后悔改，但他的心并没有真正改变。我们如何避免只在外表上表现悔改，而内心没有真正改变？

旧约充满了令人惊叹的故事。当你阅读这些关于个人的精彩故事时，记住这些较小的故事实际上是更大、更持续的故事的一部分——神的宏大故事。在这些故事中，许多人并不完全明白神在做什么。他们专注于自己的小故事，往往被骄傲、自私和叛逆所驱使。但那些蒙神祝福的人，是那些看到了更大图景的人——那些谦卑自己，顺服神话语和神统治的人。

拿巴是一个非常富有的人，正忙于在迦密山剪羊毛。大卫与他的部下在这一地区逗留了一段时间，他向拿巴请求食物和一些礼物。可是拿巴以最糟糕的方式回应了他，严词拒绝，视大卫为无足轻重的人。大卫愤怒至极，准备带领他的部下出征，打算以暴力回报拿巴的侮辱，摧毁拿巴及其家族的所有一切。

然而，拿巴的妻子亚比该看待问题的方式却不同——她看到了神的宏大故事。她知道丈夫是个愚昧人，他的行为惹怒了像大卫这样伟大的战士。但亚比该也明白，大卫，作为未来的以色列王，必须避免复仇，不能杀掉拿巴及其全家。因此，她准备了礼物，带着智慧的言辞去见大卫。她恳求大卫宽恕拿巴的过错，并提醒他更大的图景：“耶和华必定使我主建立坚固的家，因为我主是在为耶和华争战，活着时，恶事必不在你身上”（撒母耳记上25:28）。

最终，神处理了拿巴。几天后，拿巴因其愚昧的言行死去。大卫认识到亚比该的智慧后，娶了她为妻。本该是大卫大开杀戒的局面，转变成了神早已安排的婚姻。这一切发生，是因为一位聪明且敬畏神的女人始终专注于神的宏大故事，专注于神为祂所膏立的王所定的计划。

> [!important]+ 反思与回应
今天，祈求神帮助你把神的宏大故事放在心中。这就是提醒我们通过神儿子在十字架上为我们死，我们成为神儿女的故事。这也正是那个保证我们有圣灵内住，确保我们有永生并与神同治的故事！

> [!question]+ Review
> 1. ⁠How does David's decision in the cave reflect his submission to God's plan rather than relying on his own strength? What lessons can we learn from this attitude of submission when facing similar temptations in our own lives?
> 2. After David cuts off the corner of Saul's robe, he feels guilty. What does his remorse reveal? How can we understand our relationship with divinely appointed authority through this?
> 3. ⁠Saul expresses remorse after David reveals what he did, but his heart does not truly change. How can we avoid merely showing external repentance without true inner transformation?

📖 **Passage to read**: ==1 Samuel 25==

> [!info]- 🎙️Audio: [A Daily Devotional - 04.16 - EN]()  

The Old Testament is full of incredible stories. As you read about the lives of individuals, it’s important to remember that these smaller stories fit into a much larger, ongoing narrative: God’s big story. Many characters in these stories don’t fully understand what God is doing. They are caught up in their own small stories, often driven by pride, selfishness, or rebellion. But the people who are blessed by God are the ones who see the bigger picture—those who humble themselves before God’s word and submit to His rule.

Nabal was a very wealthy man, spending his time shearing sheep in Carmel. David, who had been in the area with his men for some time, sends a request to Nabal for food and supplies. But Nabal responds in the worst possible way. He refuses David’s humble request with harsh words and treats him like a nobody. David, enraged by this, prepares to take his men into battle and repay Nabal’s insult with violence, planning to destroy Nabal and everything he owns.

But Abigail, Nabal’s wife, sees things differently—she sees God’s big story. She knows her husband is a fool, and his actions have angered David, a great warrior. But Abigail also understands that David, who is to become the future king of Israel, must not carry out revenge and kill Nabal and his household. So she gathers gifts and goes to David with wise words. She pleads with him to forgive Nabal, reminding David of the bigger picture: “The LORD will certainly make my lord a sure house, because my lord is fighting the battles of the LORD, and evil shall not be found in you as long as you live” (1 Samuel 25:28).

In the end, God takes care of Nabal. He dies just a few days after his foolish actions toward David. David, recognizing the wisdom of Abigail, takes her as his wife. What could have been a tragic massacre turns into a marriage that God had planned all along. This all happened because a wise and godly woman kept her focus on God’s big story and God’s plan for His anointed king.

> [!important]+ Reflect and Respond
Pray today that God helps you keep His big story in view. This is the story that reminds us we are God’s children through the death of His Son on the cross. It’s this story that assures us that we have the Holy Spirit within us, guaranteeing our eternal life and reign with Him!
