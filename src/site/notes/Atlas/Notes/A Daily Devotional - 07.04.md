### <center>求你使我里面重新有正直的灵</center>

> [!info]- 🎙️Audio: [A Daily Devotional - 07.04 - CN]()


大卫王犯下了极大的罪。他与一个名叫拔示巴的妇人犯了奸淫，并使她怀了孕。为了掩盖自己的罪行，他设法让她的丈夫乌利亚在战场上阵亡。有一段时间，大卫没有正视自己的行为。直到神差遣先知拿单去责备他，大卫才幡然悔悟，看清了自己的罪。诗篇第五十一篇就是他在那之后向神所作的祷告。

大卫没有试图为自己辩解。他没有推卸责任，也没有为自己找借口。他只是坦诚地承认自己的过犯。他说：“因为我知道我的过犯，我的罪常在我面前。”（诗篇51:3）他完全承担起责任，没有任何保留。接着他说了一句令人惊讶的话：“我向你犯罪，惟独得罪了你。”（诗篇51:4）乍听之下这似乎说不过去。难道他不是也得罪了拔示巴、乌利亚和以色列百姓吗？是的，他的确得罪了他们。但大卫在这里提醒我们一个极其重要的真理：一切的罪首先都是得罪神。换句话说，所有的罪，最根本的是我们与神之间的破裂。

大卫知道自己需要神的赦免。但他所渴望的不只是罪得赦免，他更想要被更新。他祷告说：“神啊，求你为我造清洁的心，使我里面重新有正直的灵……求你使我仍得救恩之乐。”（诗篇51:10–12）他明白，自己所犯的罪不是一时的冲动，而是反映了内心的败坏。所以他恳求神动工，在他里面作更新的工作。他不只是想从罪的后果中脱身，更是渴望生命的改变，不再继续陷入罪中。

我们也同样需要如此。我们都需要神的怜悯与赦免，这赦免唯有借着耶稣在十字架上为我们舍命才能得着。但我们更需要新造的心，需要神来改变我们的渴望，使我们越来越爱祂，越来越远离罪。这种转变，唯有神才能成就。

> [!important]+ 反思与回应
所以，今天请你来到神面前祷告。坦诚向祂承认你的过犯。因着耶稣的救赎，请求祂赦免你。然后求祂赐你清洁的心，由圣灵更新你，使你更爱神，离弃罪。

📖 **Passage to read**: ==Psalm 51==

> [!info]- 🎙️Audio: [A Daily Devotional - 07.04 - EN]()  

King David did something horribly wrong. He slept with a woman who wasn’t his wife—Bathsheba—and then tried to cover it up by having her husband, Uriah, killed. For a while, David went on without facing what he had done. But then God sent the prophet Nathan to speak to him. When David heard Nathan’s words, his heart was broken. He saw clearly how badly he had sinned. Psalm 51 is his prayer after that.

David doesn’t try to explain himself. He doesn’t offer excuses or point fingers. Instead, he confesses everything. “I know my transgressions,” he says, “and my sin is ever before me” (51:3). He owns what he did, fully and honestly. And then he says something surprising: “Against you, you only, have I sinned” (51:4). At first that might not make sense. What about Bathsheba? What about Uriah? What about Israel? Didn’t David sin against them too? Yes. But David’s point is that before any of that, his sin was against God. All sin is first about our broken relationship with God.

David knew he needed God’s mercy. But he wanted more than a clean slate. He prayed, “Create in me a clean heart, O God.… Restore to me the joy of your salvation” (51:10–12). David wanted more than just forgiveness—he wanted to be changed. He saw that the sin he committed came from something deeper in his heart. And so he asked God to do heart work in him. He wanted God to keep working in him so he wouldn’t keep falling into the same sin.

That’s what we all need. We need forgiveness—real mercy that comes only because Jesus died on the cross for us. But we also need new hearts. We need God to shape our desires, to help us love what he loves and turn away from sin more and more. That kind of change comes only from him.

> [!important]+ Reflect and Respond
So today, come before God in prayer. Talk honestly with him about the ways you fall short. Ask him to forgive you, because Jesus died for you. And then ask him to give you a clean heart. Ask him to change you by his Spirit—so that you love him more, and sin less.
