### <center>波阿斯—我们的救赎者</center>

> [!info]- 🎙️Audio: [A Daily Devotional - 03.31 - CN]()

这个故事中有一些元素是特定于当时古代文化的。对我们来说，有些事情可能显得很奇怪，但对路得和波阿斯来说，那时却是完全正常的。然而，这个故事中的一个行为是任何文化中都不常见的——在半夜揭开一个男人的脚并爬进他的床上！那时这肯定是丑闻，今天也是如此。拿俄米指示路得做了一件事，这件事清楚地向波阿斯传达了一个信息：“我想嫁给你。”对于原始的犹太读者来说，这一定是令人震惊的，甚至可能还带有一些幽默感。尽管在这个场景中并没有发生任何不正当的事情，但这种行为本身会被认为是大胆而不合适的。路得完全是将自己暴露出来，向波阿斯请求让他照顾她并爱她。

路得提到波阿斯是“救赎者”这一点需要解释一下。根据律法，如果一个男人死了并留下了妻子或家庭，他的兄弟有责任娶他的寡妇，照顾她的孩子，并保护已故兄弟的遗产。如果这个男人没有兄弟，那么他的叔叔会承担这个责任。接下来，如果没有叔叔，就会轮到表亲等其他亲戚。路得实际上是在对波阿斯说：“你是我们的亲戚，我的丈夫死了，你可以通过结婚来‘救赎’我。”波阿斯知道自己不是最近的亲戚，于是告诉路得，他会去找最近的亲戚，看他是否愿意承担这个责任。如果那个人不愿意，波阿斯承诺会亲自娶路得来救赎她。路得带着波阿斯的承诺离开了这次私下的会面，而拿俄米也充满信心，认为波阿斯会处理好剩下的事情。

看看拿俄米和路得已经走了多远！她们一开始离神的地方很远——拿俄米因为搬迁，而路得因为她是摩押人，她们远离了神的百姓。现在，通过一起回归，她们已经回到了神的地方，并且通过正直的波阿斯迈出了成为神百姓的步伐。

> [!important]+ 反思与回应
路得对波阿斯的追求，正是我们应当如何追求基督的写照。路得找到了那个能够救赎她整个生命、情况和家庭的人，她去追求他，愿意付出一切。今天，祈求你对耶稣基督的追求也能有这样的决心。他是唯一的真正的救赎者——只有他能带来宽恕、永生，以及真正的喜乐和满足。去追求他——不惜一切代价！

### <center>Boaz the Redeemer</center>

> [!question]+ Review
> 1. ⁠Why is Boaz described as a "worthy man" in this passage? What actions of his demonstrate his worthiness?
> 2. ⁠What is the definition of a "redeemer" according to the laws of Israel? How does Boaz embody this role?
> 3. What lessons can we learn from Boaz’s actions about standing firm in God’s Word and values in our own lives?

📖 **Passage to read**: ==Ruth 03==

> [!info]- 🎙️Audio: [A Daily Devotional - 03.31 - EN]()  

This story contains a few elements that are specific to the ancient culture of that time. Some things might seem strange to us, but they would have been perfectly normal for Ruth and Boaz. However, one action in this story is not typical for any culture—uncovering a man’s feet in the middle of the night and crawling into bed with him! That would have been scandalous then, just as it would be now. Naomi instructs Ruth to do something that makes a very clear statement to Boaz: “I want to be your wife.” To the original Jewish readers, this would have been shocking, perhaps even humorous. While nothing inappropriate happens, the act itself would have been considered quite bold and improper. Ruth is putting herself out there, asking Boaz to take care of her and love her.

What Ruth says about Boaz being a redeemer needs some explanation. According to the law, if a man died and left behind a wife or family, his brother was responsible for marrying his widow, taking care of her children, and preserving the deceased man’s inheritance. If the man had no brothers, his uncle would take on the responsibility. After that, it would fall to a cousin, and so on. Ruth is essentially saying to Boaz, “You’re a relative, my husband has died, and you can ‘redeem’ me through marriage.” Boaz, realizing that he isn’t the closest relative, tells Ruth that he will go to the nearest relative to see if they are willing to take on the responsibility. If that doesn’t work out, Boaz promises that he will redeem her himself. Ruth leaves the meeting with Boaz’s promise in hand, and Naomi is confident that Boaz will handle things from here.

Look at how far Naomi and Ruth have come! They started out far from God’s place—Naomi because of a move, and Ruth because she was a Moabite. They were far from God’s people. Now, by returning together, they have come back to God’s place and have taken steps to become part of God’s people—through the righteous man, Boaz.

> [!important]+ Reflect and Respond
Ruth’s pursuit of Boaz is a great picture of how we should pursue Christ. Ruth found the person who was able to redeem her entire life, situation, and family. She went after him, willing to do whatever it took. Today, pray that your pursuit of Jesus Christ would have that same kind of commitment. He is the one true Redeemer—the only one who can offer forgiveness, eternal life, and true joy and satisfaction. Go after him—whatever it takes!
