### <center>我除了你以外别无美物</center>

> [!info]- 🎙️Audio: [A Daily Devotional - 06.29 - CN]()


约翰·派博（John Piper），明尼苏达州著名作家及前牧师，曾提出一个发人深省的问题：“若没有耶稣，你愿意去天堂吗？”换言之，即使天堂充满祝福——与亲人重聚、与朋友欢宴、永不患病——若耶稣本人不在那里，你还能感到真正的快乐吗？这个问题挑战我们反思信仰的核心：我们是因神赐予的恩典而爱祂，还是单单因祂本身而爱祂？

大卫，诗篇第十六篇的作者，向我们展示了何为对神真正的爱。他以一句简单而有力的话开头：“我要对耶和华说：‘你是我的主；除了你以外，我别无美物。’”（诗篇16:2）大卫并不是说他没有福气，作为神子民的君王，他富有且有权势，但在与神的关系中，认识神的喜乐胜过一切。

大卫对神的爱塑造了他的生活。他喜爱与神的子民同在，说：“耶和华所赐的产业何等美好，赐给人心灵的慰安也是何等甘甜！”（诗篇16:6，和合本）他喜欢与那些同样深爱神的人为伍。大卫的爱也使他对未来充满盼望——盼望蒙福、平安、喜乐和永生。他坚信说：“我的心哪，你为何忧闷？为何在我里面烦躁？应当仰望神，因我还要称赞他。”（诗篇42:5，亦可对照16:9–10）他更大胆宣告，真正的喜乐就在神的面前：“你必将生命的道路指示我；在你面前有满足的喜乐，在你右手中有永远的福乐。”（诗篇16:11）

爱神本身并不意味着忽视神所赐的福分。神赐下美善的恩典给祂的子民！然而，跟随耶稣意味着走上通往永恒喜乐的道路，即使今生会经历苦难。爱神、事奉神是我们生命中最美好的事。

因此，今天当你反思大卫的祷告时，问问自己：“我是否首先因为神本身而爱祂？”我们是否因耶稣是我们至宝而寻求祂？

> [!important]+ 反思与回应
我们已认识神是赐下美善恩赐的天父，这确实如此。但神所渴望的，不只是我们对祂祝福的感恩，祂更要我们的心。你能真诚地说：“除了你以外，我别无美物”吗？愿你今天为这真理祷告。

### <center>I Have No Good Apart from You</center>

> [!question]+ Review
> 1. ⁠How does God respond to the nations’ raging against Him in Psalm 2? What does this reveal about God’s sovereignty and power?

📖 **Passage to read**: ==Psalm 16==

> [!info]- 🎙️Audio: [A Daily Devotional - 06.29 - EN]()  

John Piper, a well-known author and former pastor from Minnesota, once asked a profound question: “Would you want heaven without Jesus?” Would you be truly happy in heaven with all its blessings—seeing loved ones, enjoying feasts, and never being sick—if Jesus Himself were not there? This question challenges us to examine the heart of our faith. Do we love God because of what He gives us, or because of who He is?

David, who wrote Psalm 16, shows us what true love for God looks like. He begins with a simple but powerful statement: “I say to the Lord, ‘You are my Lord; I have no good apart from you’” (16:2). David is not saying he lacks blessings. As the king of God’s people, he has wealth and power. But when it comes to his relationship with God, nothing compares to the joy of knowing Him.

David’s love for God shapes how he lives. He delights in being with God’s people, saying, “They are the excellent ones, in whom is all my delight” (16:3). David enjoys the company of those who love God as deeply as he does. His love also gives him hope for the future—a hope full of blessing, safety, joy, and eternal life. He confidently says, “My whole being rejoices,” because God “will not abandon my soul to Sheol, or let your holy one see corruption” (16:9–10). Even more, David boldly declares that true joy is found in God’s presence: “In your presence there is fullness of joy; at your right hand are pleasures forevermore” (16:11).

Loving God for who He is does not mean ignoring His blessings. God pours out good gifts on His people! Yet following Jesus means walking the path of eternal joy, even if suffering comes in this life. Loving and serving God is truly the best thing we can do.

So today, as you reflect on David’s prayer, ask yourself: “Do I love God first and foremost for who He is?” Do we seek Jesus because He is our greatest treasure?

> [!important]+ Reflect and Respond
We have seen God as our Father who gives good gifts. That is true. But God desires more than our thanks for His blessings. He wants our hearts. Can you honestly say, “I have no good apart from you”? Pray about this truth today.
