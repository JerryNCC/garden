### <center>书卷甘甜如蜜</center>

> [!info]- 🎙️Audio: [None]()


神呼召以西结，去向祂的百姓——以色列人——说话。这是一个悖逆、刚硬、满有罪恶的民族。耶和华说：“人子啊，我差你往以色列人那里去，就是那悖逆我的国民；他们和他们的列祖违背我，直到今日。他们是无脸无耻、心里刚硬的子孙，我差你往他们那里去。”（2:3-4）这样的描述，对听众来说并不好听！那么，以西结要对他们说什么呢？他要传讲神的审判之言。这里的画面极为生动：神将一书卷——祂的话语——交给以西结，并吩咐他吃下去。

令人惊讶的是，以西结对其滋味的描述：“我就开口，他就使我吃这书卷……我吃了，口中觉得其甜如蜜。”（3:2-3）即便其中所包含的是审判的信息，对以西结而言依然甘甜，因为这是出于神的真理，是神赐给祂百姓的完美信息。

如同以西结，我们也蒙召要细细咀嚼、领受神的话，使之成为我们生命的一部分，然后将其传递给他人。在以西结书开篇，我们看到一个奇妙的事实：这位圣洁、荣耀的神，竟愿意在祂完美的计划中使用卑微的人。第一章末尾，以西结因见神的荣光而俯伏在地；如今，因着神的怜悯，他被扶起，并被差遣参与神的主权工作。

然而，这呼召并不轻省。神的话语在口中甘甜，但前方的使命却艰难。经文的结尾带着一丝沉重：“灵将我举起，带我去；我心中甚苦、心里激动，并且耶和华的手在我身上大有能力。”（3:14）以西结怀着沉甸甸的心，走向那些被掳的同胞，要将神的审判之言传给一个不愿聆听的民族。

> [!important]+ 反思与回应
求神使我们对祂的话语愈发渴慕。祷告祂，使我们每日得以饱尝祂的真理，并像以西结一样，随时预备，将神的真道传递给身边的人。

### <center>A Scroll as Sweet as Honey</center>

> [!question]+ Review
> 1.⁠ ⁠What visions did Ezekiel see in his first vision, and how do they reveal God's holiness and glory?
2.⁠ ⁠How did Ezekiel respond when he encountered God's glory, and what lesson does this response teach believers today?
3.⁠ ⁠How, through the blood of Jesus Christ, can we now draw near to and have fellowship with this holy God?

📖 **Passage to read**: ==Ezekiel  02:01-03:15==

> [!info]- 🎙️Audio: [None]()  

God calls Ezekiel to speak to his own people, Israel—a people marked by rebellion, stubbornness, and sin. The Lord says, “Son of man, I send you to the people of Israel, to nations of rebels, who have rebelled against me. They and their fathers have transgressed against me to this very day. The descendants also are impudent and stubborn: I send you to them” (2:3–4). It’s not the kind of introduction that flatters the audience! So what is Ezekiel to say to them? He is to speak God’s words of judgment. The picture here is vivid: God hands Ezekiel a scroll—his word—and tells him to eat it.

What surprises us is how Ezekiel describes the taste. “So I opened my mouth, and he gave me this scroll to eat.… I ate it, and it was in my mouth as sweet as honey” (3:2–3). Even though the words are full of judgment, they are sweet because they come from God. They are his truth, his message, his perfect word for his people.

Like Ezekiel, we are called to take in God’s word, to let it become part of us, and then to speak it to others. And here is something remarkable from these opening chapters: the holy, glorious God chooses to work through human beings in his plan. At the end of chapter 1, Ezekiel was face down in awe. Now, by God’s mercy, he is lifted up and given a place in God’s sovereign work.

But this calling is not easy. The words Ezekiel receives are sweet, but the work ahead is hard. The passage ends with a note of heaviness: “The Spirit lifted me up and took me away, and I went in bitterness in the heat of my spirit, the hand of the LORD being strong upon me” (3:14). Ezekiel walks toward the exiles with a heavy heart. He carries God’s word of judgment for a people who will not gladly hear it.

> [!important]+ Reflect and Respond
Ask God to grow your love for his word. Pray that, as you take it in each day, you would, like Ezekiel, have his truth ready to share with those around you.
