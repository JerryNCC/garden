**捕风的劳苦**


所罗门拥有世人难以企及的地位。他拥有权柄、智慧、财富与名声——超过我们所能想象的一切。他样样都有。若世上有谁可以尽情追求享乐，那人非他莫属。他确实也这么做了。

《传道书》第2章告诉我们，所罗门不是偶然沉溺于享乐，而是有意识地踏上这条道路。他心意已定，说：“来吧，我要试试你，使你享乐。”（传2:1）于是他尝试了所有：宴乐、财富、欢笑、建造工程、音乐、女子。他追求一切属世的欢愉。结果如何？最终，他感到空虚。他称这一切为“虚空”，是“捕风”（传2:11）。这些东西没有持久的价值，不能带来满足，连一丝也没有。

所罗门不止于此，他又转向智慧的追求。但这里的智慧，更多是指学识与聪明，而非敬虔的属灵智慧。结果如何？他说：“也是虚空，也是捕风。”（传2:17）他甚至说，明白得越多，心中愁苦也越深。

于是他又投身于劳碌之中。他建造、栽种、策划诸般工程。但他想到死亡——这一切劳碌的成果最终将归于他人。这使他感到更大的失望与虚无。离了上帝的工作，与享乐一样，也是虚空，是捕风。

所罗门试遍世上一切的道路——却没有仰望神。他的结论清晰明了：这一切都如烟如雾，转瞬即逝，是捕风的劳苦。

但这章的结尾并非全然绝望。经文留下一道微光：“人莫强如吃喝，且在劳碌中享福。我看这也是出于神的手。”（传2:24）这是一个重要的线索。哪怕是每日的劳作、些许的喜乐，若出于神的手，就有意义。神赐人喜乐，神赋予人生价值。

> [!important]+ 反思与回应
离了神的享乐，终究令人空虚。但若为神而活，这世界便开始有意义。所以，向祂祷告吧。求神帮助你在世俗引诱面前信靠祂，赐你定睛永恒的盼望，并在基督里得着不变的喜乐。只有祂，才不会叫你失望。

### <center>Striving after Wind</center>

> [!question]+ Review
> 1.  ⁠How does Solomon describe life “under the sun” in Ecclesiastes 1, and why does he see it as meaningless?
> 2. What spiritual tension is Solomon expressing in the repeated phrase, “vanity of vanities, all is vanity,” as he searches for life’s meaning?
> 3. How does this passage remind us not to seek only worldly pleasures in daily life? In what ways can we “look higher” to find true purpose?

📖 **Passage to read**: ==Ecclesiastes 02==

> [!info]- 🎙️Audio: [A Daily Devotional - 07.18 - EN]()  

Solomon was in a rare position. He had power, wisdom, wealth, and fame—more than most of us could ever imagine. He had everything. If anyone could fully chase after pleasure, it was him. And that’s exactly what he did.

Ecclesiastes 2 tells us that Solomon didn’t just stumble into pleasure—he chased it on purpose. He set his heart on enjoying life. He said, *“Come now, I will test you with pleasure; enjoy yourself”* (2:1). He tried everything: parties, riches, laughter, building projects, music, and women. What did he find in the end? It all felt empty. He called it “vanity,” a “striving after wind” (2:11). It didn’t last. It didn’t satisfy. Not even a little.

But Solomon didn’t stop with pleasure. He moved on to wisdom. Not godly wisdom, necessarily, but more like knowledge and cleverness. And even that didn’t work. He wrote, *“All is vanity and a striving after wind”* (2:17). In fact, he says the more he understood, the sadder he became.

So he turned to work. Hard work. He built, planted, created. But then he thought about death—how all his work would be left to someone else. That made him feel even more hopeless. Work without God, it turns out, is just as empty as pleasure.

Solomon chased after everything the world could offer—without looking to God. And what did he learn? That all of it is like chasing the wind.

Still, the chapter doesn’t end in total despair. There’s a small crack of light near the end: *“There is nothing better for a person than that he should eat and drink and find enjoyment in his toil. This also, I saw, is from the hand of God”* (2:24). That’s a clue. Even in our daily work, even in the little pleasures, God is present. He gives joy. He gives meaning.

> [!important]+ Reflect and Respond
Pleasure without God will always leave you empty. But when you live for God, the world starts to make sense. So ask him for that. Pray that God will help you trust him when the world looks tempting. Ask him for joy that lasts—not joy in riches or fun, but in Jesus. He’s the one who won’t let you down.
