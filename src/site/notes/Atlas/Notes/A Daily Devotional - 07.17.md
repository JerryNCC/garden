### <center>日光之下</center>

> [!info]- 🎙️Audio: [A Daily Devotional - 07.17 - CN]()


你是否曾静下心来想过：*人生到底有什么意义？*
也许你明白，人生的目标是爱上帝、敬拜上帝；但你心中仍不禁好奇：若尽情追求世上所有的享乐，会是怎样的滋味？你未必是在怀疑信仰，只是忍不住想知道自己是否错过了些什么。

如果你有这样的思索，那么《传道书》正好与你心灵对话。

这卷书的作者所罗门，是一个什么都有的人。他拥有远超我们想象的财富，千位妻妾，自称皆是他的夫人；他有智慧，可能胜过历史上所有的君王。但就是这样一位非凡的王，也曾深深挣扎于人生的意义。他在极大的财富和荣耀中，却找不到真正的满足。《传道书》记录了他内心的挣扎——一本极其诚实的书，他毫无保留地袒露自己的心声。

这卷书不断重复的叹息，在第一章第二节便已显露：“虚空的虚空，虚空的虚空，凡事都是虚空。”
人生仿佛一阵烟、一片云。财富、声望、成功……这一切终将过去。你无法紧紧抓住它们，就如你无法握住一团雾、将云彩放入口袋。所罗门继续述说在“日光之下”所追求的一切如何都是徒然。他甚至放弃了对智慧的追求，因为连那也带来烦恼。“因为多有智慧就多有愁烦；加增知识的，就加增忧伤”（传1:18）。这真是一个哀伤的开篇！

但《传道书》的用意正是在此。它不急于给答案，而是让我们真实地感受生命的张力。它邀请我们直面现实：脱离神的生命，在“日光之下”的生活，是多么地迷惘与痛苦。

不过，经文也留下一丝希望。在第三节，所罗门首次使用了“日光之下”这个词语。你若只在“日光之下”寻求意义，注定是徒劳的。你必须抬头仰望，向上看。只有那时，人生的追寻才真正开始变得有意义。

> [!important]+ 反思与回应
如果你也在寻找，就祷告吧。求神帮助你，在寻找中真正遇见祂。向那位创造你的上帝祷告，求祂让你清楚看见祂，并真实认识祂。因为祂离你并不远。

📖 **Passage to read**: ==Ecclesiastes 01==

> [!info]- 🎙️Audio: [A Daily Devotional - 07.17 - EN]()  


Have you ever sat still and wondered, *What’s the point of all this?* Maybe you know life is about loving and worshiping God, but part of you still wonders what it would be like to chase every pleasure the world offers. Maybe you’re not doubting your faith, but you’re curious. You want to know if you’re missing out.

If that’s you, then the book of Ecclesiastes speaks your language.

The author, Solomon, was a man who had it all. He had more money than he could ever spend. He had hundreds of wives. He had wisdom that amazed the world. But still, with all of it, he struggled. In fact, the book of Ecclesiastes is the story of his struggle. It’s honest—painfully honest. He doesn’t pretend everything’s fine. He tells the truth: even with everything, he felt empty.

Right near the start, he says it plainly: “Vanity of vanities, all is vanity.” Life feels like chasing the wind. You can’t hold on to it. Wealth fades. Success fades. Even the good things don’t last. They can’t satisfy your soul.

Solomon even tried gaining wisdom. That didn’t work either. He found that the more he understood, the more it hurt. “In much wisdom is much vexation,” he said. “He who increases knowledge increases sorrow.” (Eccl. 1:18) Not the happiest start to a book, is it?

But that’s the point. Ecclesiastes doesn’t rush to the answer. It sits with the questions. It wants you to feel the tension. It wants you to realize that life *under the sun*—life apart from God—is confusing and hard.

There is a hint, though. In verse 3, Solomon uses that phrase: “under the sun.” That’s where all the frustration lives. The things we chase *under the sun* don’t satisfy. But what if we looked above the sun? What if we looked higher?

That’s where the search starts to make sense.

> [!important]+ Reflect and Respond
If you’re searching, pray. Ask God to show you the truth. Ask him to help you find more than just what’s under the sun. Ask to see him. He’s the one who made you—and he’s not far off.
