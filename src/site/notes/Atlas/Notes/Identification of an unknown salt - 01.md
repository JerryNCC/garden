### Essay Question: Identification of an Unknown Salt

You have been provided with an unknown simple salt. Your task is to identify the salt by performing a series of tests and making step-by-step deductions based on your observations. Follow the steps below to determine the identity of the salt.

#### Information:
- **Appearance of the Salt**: The unknown salt appears as a white crystalline powder.
- **Result of Heating Test**: When the salt is heated, salt doesn't decompose. 

#### Tests for Cation and Anion:
1. **Test for Cation (Metal Ion)**: 
    - When a few drops of sodium hydroxide (NaOH) are added to a solution of the salt, a pale yellow precipitate forms. This precipitate is insoluble in excess NaOH.
   
2. **Test for Anion (Non-Metal Ion)**:
    - When a few drops of dilute nitric acid (HNO₃) and a few drops of silver nitrate (AgNO₃) are added to a solution of the salt, a white precipitate forms.
> [!info]- Deduction
> Chloride ion is present. 

#### Confirmatory Tests:
1. **Confirmatory Test:**
   - After the heating test, the yellow-brown gas produced, which has a pungent odor.  
> [!info]- Deduction
> It indicates the presence of lead. The gas is likely to be lead(IV) oxide (PbO₂) being reduced to lead(II) oxide (PbO) with the release of oxygen.
   
2. **Confirmatory Test (if applicable)**:
   - If ammonia is suspected, add sodium hydroxide to the solution of the salt. If ammonia gas is released when heated, this could confirm the presence of an ammonium salt.

#### Task:
Based on the information above, identify the unknown salt. Write a detailed essay that outlines each step of the process, from observing the appearance of the salt, conducting the heating test, performing the tests for the cation and anion, and applying the confirmatory tests. Your deductions should lead to the identification of the salt.

> [!warning]-  Answer Key:
> - The **pale yellow precipitate** formed when sodium hydroxide is added is characteristic of **lead(II)** ions (Pb²⁺).
> - The **white precipitate** formed with silver nitrate is indicative of the presence of **chloride ions** (Cl⁻).
  > By analyzing these observations step by step, the unknown salt can be identified as **lead(II) chloride**, which has the chemical formula \( \text{PbCl}_2 \).
