圣经常常通过一个人的出生故事，暗示其未来的命运。例如雅各，他出生时抓住哥哥以扫的脚跟，他的一生充满了抓取与欺骗。同样，摩西非凡的出生经历仿佛在宣告：“这是一个非凡的人！”上帝对摩西有伟大的计划，要通过他为自己的子民成就美好的事工。  

从人的角度来看，摩西本不可能活过三个月。法老下令要杀死所有希伯来男婴，摩西的母亲别无选择，只能完全信靠上帝。她将孩子放在篮子里，任其漂浮在河上。令人惊奇的是，法老的女儿发现了篮子，并决定将摩西收养为自己的孩子。更奇妙的是，摩西的母亲竟然被法老家雇佣，成为了哺育自己亲生儿子的奶妈。  

摩西长大后，他热情的性格让他惹上了麻烦。有一次，他看到一名埃及人殴打一位希伯来人，愤怒之下，他杀了那名埃及人并将尸体埋藏。当法老得知此事后，想要杀死摩西。摩西只得逃命，躲入旷野之中。  

然而，故事并未在摩西的逃亡中结束。与此同时，埃及的以色列人遭受更深的苦难，他们向上帝哀求。圣经告诉我们，上帝听到了他们的哀声，“记念他与亚伯拉罕所立的约”（出埃及记2:24）。摩西的故事表明，上帝并没有忘记他的子民。即便在旷野中，上帝也在预备摩西，使他成为带领以色列人脱离奴役的救赎者。这位逃亡者将成为上帝子民的领袖——他们的王子与审判官。  

> [!important]+ 反思与回应
在整个过程中，上帝一直在幕后一手掌控，保守摩西的生命，为他未来的使命装备他。他将回到埃及，作为上帝的使者，勇敢地向法老发声，并带领以色列人获得自由。上帝的计划从未动摇。祈求上帝帮助我们今天也能记住这一点，相信他永不止息，他始终在为他的子民成就他的旨意。

📖 **Passage to read**: ==Exodus 01==

> [!info]- 🎙️Audio: [A Daily Devotional - 02.01 - EN]()

The Bible often shows that the story of someone’s birth can hint at their future. Take Jacob, for example—he was born holding his brother Esau’s heel, and his life was marked by grabbing and deceiving. In the same way, the extraordinary circumstances of Moses’s birth tell us, “This will be an extraordinary man!” God had great plans to work through Moses for the good of his people.

From a human perspective, Moses shouldn’t have lived past three months. Pharaoh wanted every Hebrew baby boy dead, and Moses’s mother had no choice but to trust God completely. She placed her baby in a basket and set it afloat on the river. Remarkably, Pharaoh’s daughter found the basket and decided to adopt the baby as her own. In a surprising turn of events, Moses’s mother was hired—by Pharaoh’s household—to nurse her own son.

As Moses grew up, his passionate nature led him into trouble. When he saw an Egyptian beating a fellow Hebrew, Moses killed the Egyptian in anger and hid the body. When Pharaoh learned about it, he sought to kill Moses. But Moses fled, running for his life into the wilderness.

The chapter doesn’t stop with Moses’s flight. Back in Egypt, the suffering of God’s people grew worse, and they cried out to him. We’re told that God heard their cries and “remembered his covenant with Abraham” (2:24). Moses’s story shows that God hadn’t forgotten his people. He was preparing Moses, even in the wilderness, to deliver them from slavery. This fugitive would become a leader—a prince and judge for God’s people.

> [!important]+ Reflect and Respond
Through it all, God was working behind the scenes, preserving Moses’s life and equipping him for the mission ahead. He would return to Egypt as God’s messenger, speak boldly to Pharaoh, and lead the Israelites to freedom. God’s plans never falter. Ask him to help you remember that today. Trust that he never rests or steps away from working for his people and fulfilling his purposes.
