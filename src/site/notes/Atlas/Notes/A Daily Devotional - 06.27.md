### <center>喜爱耶和华的律法</center>

> [!info]- 🎙️Audio: [A Daily Devotional - 06.26 - CN]()

诗篇不仅仅是一部祷告与赞美的诗歌集，它是神子民敬拜神的书卷。许多诗篇本是为敬拜时合唱而写，既有诗意也有节奏感，有些甚至是古老的诗歌字母诗。诗篇更不仅如此，它们教导我们认识神——祂的性情、祂的救恩，以及祂为子民所行的大能奇事。归根结底，诗篇引导神的子民怎样智慧地遵行神的话语，活出敬虔的生命。

有了这样的理解，我们就能明白为何诗篇以第一篇开头。这篇诗是整本诗篇的主题诗，表达了贯穿全书的核心信息：神的子民喜爱神的话语，并以此为生命的根基。

诗人通过诗篇第一篇中两类人的鲜明对比，来揭示这一真理。再看第一、二节：“不从恶人的计谋，不站罪人的道路，不坐亵慢人的座位，惟喜爱耶和华的律法，昼夜思想，这人便为有福。”换言之，敬虔人不会深交那不敬畏神、拒绝神话语的人。反而，他们喜爱神的话，时时默想。诗人说，这是人生得福的关键，无论今生还是永远。

恶人如同风吹的草一样，转眼消逝；但那以神话为根基的人，如同栽于溪水旁的树，深扎根基，枝叶茂盛。诗人更指向审判的日子，恶人必站立不住，无法与神的子民同在；但义人却蒙神认识，在祂里面得享安稳。

短短六节经文，清楚地引入了整卷诗篇的信息：神的子民当喜爱、听从并遵行神的话语。如此，他们在今生得着保障，在永世得着救赎。

> [!important]+ 反思与回应
你可以花些时间为诗篇第一篇祷告，求神帮助你喜爱并以祂的话为乐。祈求靠着耶稣的信心，成为那坚固栽植的树，不随风飘荡，如同不认识神人的糠秕。

📖 **Passage to read**: ==Psalm 01==

> [!info]- 🎙️Audio: [A Daily Devotional - 06.27 - EN]()  


The book of Psalms is more than just a collection of prayers and songs. It’s a worship book designed for God’s people to praise Him together. Many of the psalms were meant to be sung during worship. They are poetic and rhythmic; some are even acrostic poems. But the Psalms also teach us about God—His character, His salvation, and His mighty deeds for His people. Ultimately, the Psalms guide God’s people on how to live wisely by obeying God’s Word.

With this in mind, it makes sense that Psalm 1 opens the book. It’s like the theme song for all the Psalms. This psalm introduces the main message repeated throughout the book: God’s people love His Word and live by it.

The psalmist shows this truth by contrasting two kinds of people in Psalm 1. Look again at verses 1 and 2. “Blessed is the man,” he says, who does not “walk,” “stand,” or “sit” with sinners, mockers, or evil people. In other words, the godly person does not get too close to those who reject God and His Word. Instead, this blessed person delights in God’s Word and thinks about it constantly. The psalmist says this is the key to a full life, both now and forever.

Wicked people are like grass that the wind blows away. But those who build their lives on God’s Word are like a tree planted by streams of water, firmly rooted and flourishing. The psalmist points us ahead to the day of judgment, when the wicked will not stand before God or His people. But the righteous are known by God and secure in Him.

In just six short verses, Psalm 1 gives us a clear introduction to the whole book of Psalms: God’s people are to love, listen to, and live by His Word. When they do, they find security in this life and eternal salvation in the next.

> [!important]+ Reflect and Respond
Take some time to pray over Psalm 1. Ask God to help you love His Word and delight in it. Pray that by faith in Jesus, you would be like that strong, planted tree, not like the chaff blown away with those who do not know Him.
