### <center>谦卑、像孩子般的信心</center>

> [!info]- 🎙️Audio: [None]()

马可在这段经文中给我们两幅深刻的画面。首先，人们把小孩子带到耶稣面前，要祂按手祝福。门徒想要阻止他们，也许以为孩子们会打扰耶稣，或浪费祂的时间。但耶稣却有不同的看法。祂责备门徒，说：“我实在告诉你们，凡要承受　神国的，若不像小孩子，断不能进去。”（马可福音10:15）祂要门徒从孩子身上学习。孩子单纯信靠，知道自己需要帮助，不带着任何可以换取赏赐的东西来。这就是进入　神国的方式。

接着，马可记载一个富有的人来到耶稣面前。他跑来问说：“良善的夫子，我当做什么事才可以承受永生？”（马可福音10:17）注意他的问题，他想知道自己能*做*什么。他以为永生是靠努力得来的。耶稣列举几条与待人相关的诫命——不可杀人、不可奸淫、当孝敬父母等等。那人回答说，他从小就遵守这一切。但耶稣看见他内心的真实，就对他说：“你还缺少一件：去变卖你所有的，分给穷人，就必有财宝在天上；你还要来跟从我。”（马可福音10:21）那人听见这话，脸上就变了色，忧忧愁愁地走了，因为他的财富捆绑了他的心，他舍不得放下。金钱成了他的神。

耶稣呼召我们像孩子一样来到祂面前。孩子是空着手来的，单单领受。我们不能靠善行赚取救恩，也不能抓住任何与神争夺我们心的偶像。我们必须单单信靠耶稣，得着赦罪、生命与盼望。

求神赐给你这样的信心。求祂光照你心中一切比祂更重要的事物，打破它们的权势，引导你带着谦卑、单纯的心来到救主耶稣面前。

### <center>Humble, Childlike Faith</center>

📖 **Passage to read**: ==Mark 10.13-31==

> [!info]- 🎙️Audio: [None]()  

Mark gives us two powerful pictures in this passage. First, people are bringing little children to Jesus so he can bless them. The disciples try to stop them. Maybe they think the children are bothering Jesus or taking up too much of his time. But Jesus sees it differently. He corrects the disciples and says, “Truly, I say to you, whoever does not receive the kingdom of God like a child shall not enter it” (10:15). He wants his followers to learn from these children. Children come with trust. They know they need help. They don’t bring anything to earn a reward. That is the way to enter God’s kingdom.

Next, Mark tells us about a man who has great wealth. He runs to Jesus and asks, “What must I do to inherit eternal life?” (10:17). Notice his question. He wants to know what he can *do*. He thinks eternal life is something to achieve. Jesus names several commandments about how we treat others—don’t murder, don’t commit adultery, honor your parents, and so on. The man answers that he has kept them all. But Jesus looks deeper. He tells the man, “Go, sell all that you have and give to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven; and come, follow me” (10:21). The man walks away sad. His wealth holds his heart. He cannot give it up. His money has become his god.

Jesus calls us to come to him like children. Children come with empty hands, ready to receive. We cannot earn salvation by doing good works, and we cannot cling to idols that compete with God. We must trust Jesus alone for forgiveness, life, and hope.

> [!important]+ Reflect and Respond
Pray that God will give you this kind of faith. Ask him to show you anything you love more than him, to break its power, and to draw you to Jesus with a humble, childlike heart.
