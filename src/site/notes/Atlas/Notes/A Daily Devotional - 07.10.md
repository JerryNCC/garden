### <center>鉴察我，知道我</center>

> [!info]- 🎙️Audio: [A Daily Devotional - 07.10 - CN]()

世上并没有一个穿着红衣的神秘老人，像圣诞歌曲《Santa Claus Is Coming to Town》所唱的那样，无时无刻监视我们的行为。但我们确实有一位造物主，祂完全认识我们的一切，也洞察我们内心最深处的意念。

大卫深知这一点。他在诗篇一百三十九篇开头写道：“耶和华啊，你鉴察我，认识我。”（诗139:1）祂知道我什么时候坐下，什么时候起来。甚至在我还没有开口说话之前，祂已完全明了我心中所想。紧接着，大卫进一步思想：无论他往哪里去，神都在那里。无论高处或低处、明处或暗处——神的同在是无所不在、无所不至的。祂鉴察一切，也常与祂的子民同在。

这样的神让人有什么样的感受？感到暴露？感到不安？也许吧。但大卫的回应却出人意料：他称颂神。“我要称谢你，因我受造奇妙可畏；你的作为奇妙，这是我心深知道的。”（诗139:14）大卫不是逃避神的洞察，而是因祂的全知而欢喜。为什么？因为这位洞悉万事的神，正是那位亲手创造他的神。“我的肺腑是你所造的，我在母腹中，你已覆庇我。”（诗139:13）大卫明白，神深知他，因为神深爱他。祂在他尚未出生之前，早已定意地塑造他。这份深知来自深情，这使惧怕转化为安慰。

大卫与神的关系改变了一切。他不是在对一位全能的陌生者说话，而是在向一位认识他、并仍然爱他的神倾心吐意。因此他满心敬拜，欢然颂赞。

然后我们来到第十九至二十二节。这几节经文可能令我们感到突兀，甚至觉得激烈，但它们仍是大卫祷告的一部分。他呼求那位全知的神，察看这世上的恶，并施行公义的审判。这同样是敬拜的一部分。当我们爱神时，也学习去爱祂所爱、恨祂所恨。大卫没有亲自报复，而是信靠那位公义的审判者，知道祂必施行判断。

> [!important]+ 反思与回应
你也是这位神亲手所造的——精细、奇妙、满有目的。祂认识你，也渴望你认识祂。今天，就来向祂献上感谢，因祂按着祂的美意创造了你。因祂认识你每一寸心灵而颂赞祂。也求祂帮助你更深明白祂的全知与大能，并因耶稣基督为你舍命，使你能与祂建立关系，活在祂面前。

📖 **Passage to read**: ==Psalm 139==

> [!info]- 🎙️Audio: [A Daily Devotional - 07.10 - EN]()  

There’s no magical man in a red suit watching everything we do, no matter what the song says. But there is someone who really does know us completely. God—our Creator—sees everything about us. He knows our actions, our thoughts, and even our hidden motives.

David knew this well. He begins Psalm 139 with a simple truth: “O Lord, you have searched me and known me!” (v. 1). He says that God knows when he sits down and when he gets up. God even knows what David is going to say before he says it. Then David reflects more deeply: no matter where he goes, God is there. Whether high or low, light or darkness—God’s presence is inescapable. God sees all, knows all, and is always near.

So how does this make us feel? Exposed? Nervous? It could. But look at David’s response: he praises God. “I praise you, for I am fearfully and wonderfully made” (v. 14). David doesn’t run away from God’s knowledge—he rejoices in it. Why? Because this God who knows everything is also the one who made him. “You knitted me together in my mother’s womb,” he says (v. 13). David realizes that God’s deep knowledge comes from deep care. God’s eyes were on him even before he was born. And this turns fear into comfort.

David’s relationship with God changes everything. He’s not just talking about an all-powerful being. He’s speaking to his personal God—one who knows him fully and still loves him. That’s why David can worship with joy.

Then we reach verses 19–22. They can feel surprising, even harsh. But they’re part of David’s prayer. He’s asking God to see the evil in the world and judge it rightly. This, too, is part of worship. When we love God, we also learn to love what he loves and hate what he hates. David doesn’t take revenge himself—he trusts God to act justly.

> [!important]+ Reflect and Respond
You were made by this same God—carefully, wonderfully, purposefully. He knows you and wants you to know him. So thank him for forming you with care. Praise him for knowing every part of you. Ask him to help you live in relationship with him, trusting in what Jesus has done to bring you close to him.
