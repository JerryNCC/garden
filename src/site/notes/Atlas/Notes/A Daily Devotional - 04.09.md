### <center>承受压力</center>

> [!info]- 🎙️Audio: [A Daily Devotional - 04.09 - CN]()

在《撒母耳记上》第13章中，我们看到扫罗在他统治的第一个重大压力面前。他与非利士人作战，这些人是神的百姓的敌人，一直是以色列的威胁。扫罗的儿子约拿单刚刚在基比亚打败了非利士人的一部分军队。但非利士人并没有退缩，他们召集了全军与以色列作战。扫罗陷入了困境，兵力上严重不足，他的一些士兵开始躲藏在洞里，其他一些则逃往周围的地方。

撒母耳曾给扫罗一个重要的命令。扫罗要先去吉甲，等待撒母耳在那里与他会合，并为神献祭。扫罗被告知要等七天，撒母耳才会到达；因为撒母耳是祭司，只有他才能代表百姓献祭。然而，随着压力的增大，扫罗开始崩溃。在情势严峻的压力下，他决定采取行动。他命令准备祭品和木材，并亲自献上燔祭。就在他完成献祭后，撒母耳出现了，而且他对扫罗非常不满。撒母耳告诉他，因为扫罗做了这一行为，神将夺去他的王位，另立一位“合神心意的人”来做王（13:14）。

我们很容易理解扫罗为何会在这种情况下选择自己献祭。在巨大的压力下，事情看起来非常不利。然而，神在祂的律法中已明确规定，只有祭司才能为百姓献祭。扫罗是王，但不是祭司，他无权这样做。他选择这样做不仅仅是一个错误，而是对神命令的直接违背。这一行为暴露了扫罗内心的真实状况。在压力、紧张和危险面前，扫罗没有等待神，而是试图自己解决问题。

> [!important]+ 反思与回应
扫罗不能同时担任两个角色！他只是一个人，而且是一个有罪的人。他需要祭司为他献祭。扫罗自己亲自做出这一选择，显露了他内心的骄傲。今天，请花些时间反思你内心是否有骄傲。向神认罪，并求祂饶恕你那些有时像不需要祂——无论是作为救主，还是在每天的生活中——的时刻。

### <center>Under Pressure</center>

> [!question]+ Review
> 1. How did Saul become king over Israel according to 1 Samuel 10? Why did his appearance and characteristics make the people think he was the ideal king?
> 2. Why does Samuel specifically say “there is none like him among all the people” during Saul's coronation? What insight does this give us into the relationship between the king of Israel and God’s kingship?
> 3. What inner motivations are revealed through Saul’s decision to offer the sacrifice himself? What warning does this act give us about obeying God's commands?

📖 **Passage to read**: ==1 Samuel 13==

> [!info]- 🎙️Audio: [A Daily Devotional - 04.9 - EN]()  


In 1 Samuel 13, we see Saul facing the first major pressure of his reign. He’s at war with the Philistines, the enemies of God’s people who have always been a threat to the Israelites. Saul’s son Jonathan has just won a significant victory over the Philistine garrison at Geba. But the Philistines aren’t backing down—they gather their entire army to fight against Israel. Saul is in a difficult position. He’s outnumbered, and some of his men start hiding in caves, while others begin to flee to nearby areas.

Samuel had given Saul an important command. Saul was to go to Gilgal and wait for Samuel, who would come and offer sacrifices to God. Saul was to wait for seven days, because only Samuel, as the priest, was allowed to lead the people in sacrifice. But as the pressure mounts, Saul begins to crack. Feeling the weight of the situation, he decides to act. He orders the animals and wood for the sacrifice and performs the burnt offering himself. Just as he finishes, Samuel arrives, and he is not pleased with Saul. Samuel tells him that because of this act, God will take the kingdom away from him and give it to another—a man “after His own heart” (13:14).

It’s easy to understand why Saul might have felt compelled to make the sacrifice himself. He was under pressure, and things were not looking good. However, God had clearly stated in His law that only priests could perform sacrifices. Saul, a king but not a priest, was not allowed to take this action. His choice to do so was not just a mistake—it was a direct disobedience to God’s command. This act showed what was in Saul’s heart. Under pressure, rather than waiting on God, Saul tried to solve the problem by himself.

> [!important]+ Reflect and Respond
Saul couldn’t have two roles. He was a man, and a sinful one at that. He needed a priest to make sacrifices for him. His decision to take matters into his own hands revealed a heart of pride. Today, take some time to reflect on any pride you might have in your own heart. Confess it to God, and ask Him for forgiveness for the times you act like you don’t need Him, whether as Savior or in the everyday struggles of life.
