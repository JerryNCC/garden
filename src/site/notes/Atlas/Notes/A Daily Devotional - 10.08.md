### <center>本丢彼拉多</center>

> [!info]- 🎙️Audio: [None]()

本丢彼拉多是罗马派驻犹太的巡抚。自从罗马征服耶路撒冷后，他就被任命治理此地。在约翰福音第十八章里，彼拉多被牵入事件，因为犹太人没有权柄执行死刑，他们必须依靠罗马的判决。于是他们把耶稣带到彼拉多面前。起初，彼拉多并不愿意插手，他对他们说：“你们自己带他去，按你们的律法审问吧！”（18:31）但犹太人坚持，要他审查耶稣并支持他们的控告。

彼拉多摸不清耶稣到底是谁，也不明白他真正的意图。然而，耶稣却让他心生好奇。他问道：“这样，你是王吗？”（18:37）耶稣回答说，他的国不属这世界，并且指出：他的声音是人得着真理的关键。彼拉多随即吐出一句著名的话：“真理是什么呢？”（18:38）这话显明了他的内心。他已不再相信真理可寻。他是个愤世嫉俗的人，被金钱、权力和政治所捆绑，与站在他面前的独一真神相去甚远。

然而，耶稣身上仍有某种吸引力，使彼拉多无法轻易撇开。他多次试着释放耶稣，因为他深知耶稣并非罪犯。但暴怒的群众毫不妥协。彼拉多无奈之下，再次转向耶稣，几乎带着焦躁，盼望他能为自己辩护。耶稣却平静回答，提醒彼拉多：他所拥有的一切权柄，都是从上头赐下的。从那时起，彼拉多设法要释放他。但最终，群情汹涌的压力，以及他对失去凯撒恩宠的恐惧，使他屈服了。他下令，将一位无辜的人交付钉十字架。

> [!important]+ 反思与回应
彼拉多是个耐人寻味的人物。他被耶稣吸引，却不愿相信；被耶稣打动，却不肯跟随；他对耶稣抱有兴趣，却停留在观望、犹疑之中。可悲的是，面对耶稣，唯一正确的回应就是信。信他是上帝的儿子，掌管一切权柄；信他的话语是真理，唯一的真理；信他到一个地步，将生命完全交在他的主权之下。彼拉多始终没有走到这一步。那么，你呢？祈求你的心不止步于好奇与尊敬，而是继续向前，进入敬拜、信靠与顺服基督的生命。

### <center>Pontius Pilate</center>

> [!question]+ Review
> 1. In John 17, when Jesus first prays for himself, what does he ask the Father for, and what is the purpose
> 2. How does Jesus intercede for his disciples in his prayer, and what does he especially ask the Father to give them?
> 3. When Jesus prays for future believers, what is his main concern, and what is the purpose of this unity?

📖 **Passage to read**: ==John 18.28-19.16==

> [!info]- 🎙️Audio: [None]()  

Pontius Pilate was the Roman governor in charge of Judea. He had been put in place by Rome, since the empire held power over Jerusalem after conquering it years before. In John 18, Pilate becomes part of the story because the Jewish leaders could not carry out an execution without Roman authority. So they brought Jesus to him. At first, Pilate wants no part in it. He tells them, “Take him yourselves and judge him by your own law” (18:31). But the people press him to hear the case and support their charges.

Pilate struggles to understand who Jesus is or what he claims. Yet something about Jesus catches his attention. He asks, “So you are a king?” (18:37). Jesus explains that his kingdom is not of this world. Then he adds that his voice is the key for people to know the truth. Pilate responds with the famous words, “What is truth?” (18:38). Those words show his heart. Pilate is a man who has stopped believing truth can be found. He is a cynic, tied up with money, power, and politics—far away from knowing the God who stands before him.

Still, Pilate is drawn to Jesus. He looks for ways to release him, because he knows Jesus is no criminal. But the angry crowd will not be reasoned with. Pilate turns to Jesus again, frustrated, hoping for a defense. Jesus answers quietly, reminding Pilate that any power he has is only given from above. From that point, Pilate tries to let him go. But his fear of the crowd—and his fear of losing Caesar’s favor—win out. At last, he gives in and hands Jesus over to be crucified.

> [!important]+ Reflect and Respond
Pilate is a striking figure. He is interested in Jesus, even moved by him, but he will not believe, follow, or defend him. And that is the tragedy. Because there is only one right way to respond to Jesus: to believe. To believe that he is the Son of God with all authority. To believe that his words are truth, the only truth. To believe in him so fully that you submit your life to his rule. Pilate never did. What about you? Pray that your heart would not stop at curiosity or respect, but move on to worship, trust, and obedience to Jesus.
