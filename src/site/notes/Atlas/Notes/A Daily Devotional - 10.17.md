> [!question]+ 回顾昨天的内容
> 1.  亚拿尼亚和撒非喇的罪，不在于他们没有奉献全部的钱财，而在于他们对上帝说谎。  ——从这件事中，你看见上帝怎样看待“动机”和“诚实”的重要性？
> 2. 这段经文显示上帝对祂教会的圣洁有多么在意。  ——在今日的教会生活中，我们该如何保持属灵的真诚与纯净？
> 3. 上帝看重人内心的真实，胜过外表的虔诚。  ——你是否曾在意外在的“敬虔形象”，却忽略了心灵的真敬拜？  
今天你愿意怎样向神回应？

### <center>司提反的陈述</center>

> [!info]- 🎙️Audio: [None]()

司提反正处在极大的危险中。  
他不仅在百姓中行神迹奇事，也勇敢地见证耶稣基督就是那位应许的弥赛亚。耶路撒冷的宗教领袖无法反驳他的智慧，便使出老手段——设立假见证人，控告他亵渎神。于是，司提反被带到公会面前，要为自己的信仰作辩护。这时，他的性命悬于一线。

当被问及为何如此行时，司提反开始诉说以色列的历史：他提到神呼召亚伯拉罕，述说约瑟在埃及的遭遇，又回顾摩西带领百姓在旷野中的日子。  
然而，他的讲论很快转了一个锋利的方向——他指出，神从未真正住在旷野的会幕里，也不住在所罗门那辉煌的圣殿中。事实上，神从未需要人手所造的殿宇。  
司提反的意思很清楚：旧约的故事尚未完结。没有任何帐幕或殿宇能容纳创造天地的真神，也不能赐下完全的救赎。

接着，他说出那令众人震怒的真理：旧约的应许终极的完成，不在于新的殿，也不在于新的律法，而是在于一位人——耶稣基督，神所立的弥赛亚。  
他勇敢地指出，这位耶稣正是他们亲手弃绝、钉死的那一位。

问题就在于耶稣。  
若耶稣真是他所宣称的那位弥赛亚，那么这些宗教领袖便错失了整个圣经的核心。司提反称他为“那义者”（徒7:52），这话他们听得懂，也无法接受。若此话为真，他们便成了拒绝神儿子的人。愤怒充满他们的心，他们无法再忍受，便用石头将司提反打死——这位忠心的见证人成为第一位为基督殉道的信徒。

> [!important]+ 反思与回应
你愿意像司提反一样，为耶稣的真理站立到底吗？  
你是否愿意为承认祂是神的儿子而付上代价？  
求神鉴察你的心，坚固你的信心，使你在任何境况中都能持守真理。求祂赐你勇气，使你无论面对何种代价，也不否认耶稣基督的名。

### <center>Stephen's Speech</center>

> [!question]+ Review
> 1. Ananias and Sapphira’s sin was not withholding money, but lying to God.  What does this teach you about how seriously God views our motives and honesty?
> 2. This passage shows how deeply God cares about the purity of His church.  How can we maintain spiritual sincerity and holiness in today’s church life?
> 3. God values the heart more than outward appearance.  Have you ever focused more on looking “spiritual” than truly worshiping Him in your heart?  How would you like to respond to God today?

📖 **Passage to read**: ==使徒行传 07==

> [!info]- 🎙️Audio: [None]()  


Stephen is in serious danger. He has been performing miracles and boldly speaking about Jesus Christ, the promised Messiah. The Jewish leaders in Jerusalem cannot argue against his wisdom, so they turn to deceit. They find false witnesses to accuse Stephen of blasphemy, just as they once did with Jesus. Now Stephen stands before the Jewish council, facing deadly charges. When asked to explain himself, he begins to speak—and his life depends on what he says next.

Stephen responds by telling the story of God’s people. He begins with Abraham’s call, moves through Joseph’s suffering in Egypt, and recalls Moses leading God’s rebellious people in the wilderness. But Stephen’s story takes a sharp turn. He reminds his listeners that God never truly lived in the tabernacle or even in Solomon’s magnificent temple. God, he says, does not dwell in houses made by human hands. Stephen’s point is that the whole Old Testament story was incomplete. No building could ever contain the living God or bring full salvation to sinners.

Then comes the moment that seals his fate. Stephen proclaims that all of Scripture finds its fulfillment not in a new temple or a new law, but in a person—Jesus Christ, the Messiah. And this Jesus, he declares, is the one the Jewish leaders rejected and killed.

That was too much for them to bear. Stephen’s words make it clear: if Jesus truly is who he claimed to be, then the Jewish leaders have missed the very heart of God’s plan. They understand what Stephen is saying. If Jesus is the “Righteous One,” as Stephen calls him in verse 52, then they are guilty of rejecting God’s own Son. Rage fills their hearts. They cannot stand to hear any more, and in their fury they stone Stephen to death—the first Christian martyr.

> [!important]+ Reflect and Respond
Would you stand firm for Jesus like Stephen did? Would you risk your life for the truth that he is God’s Son? Pray that God would strengthen your heart to trust in his Son completely. Ask him to give you courage to stand for Jesus Christ—whatever the cost.
