唯独基督 是我盼望  
我的明灯 诗歌力量  
这房角石 为我根基  
面对风暴 也不摇动  
无比大爱 最深平安  
恐惧除尽 挣扎止息  
作我安慰 作我万有  
靠主大爱 我能站立  
  
唯独基督 道成肉身  
永恒真道 降生马槽  
如此大爱 属天公义  
却被罪人 藐视厌弃  
直到救主 舍身十架  
神的震怒 才得平息  
在基督里 罪被涂抹  
借祂的死 我得称义  
  
在墓穴中 我主躺卧  
生命之光 黑暗淹没  
祂却复生 彻底得胜  
冲破死荫 王权永恒  
祂今站立 在荣耀里  
罪恶毒钩 完全除弃  
因我属祂 祂也属我  
基督宝血 把我遮蔽  
  
一生无恐 遇死不怕  
基督大能 在我心里  
从母胎起 直到安息  
我的一生 耶稣做主  
阴间权势 恶人计谋  
永不使我 与主远离  
到主再来 到我安息  
靠主大能 我永站立  
  
阴间权势 恶人计谋  
永不使我 与主远离  
到主再来 到我安息  
靠主大能 我永站立


In Christ alone my hope is found  
He is my light, my strength, my song  
This cornerstone, this solid ground  
Firm through the fiercest drought and storm  
What heights of love, what depths of peace  
When fears are stilled, when strivings cease  
My comforter, my all in all  
Here in the love of Christ I stand  
  
In Christ alone, who took on flesh  
Fullness of God in helpless babe  
This gift of love and righteousness  
Scorned by the ones He came to save  
‘Til on that cross as Jesus died  
The wrath of God was satisfied  
For every sin on Him was laid  
Here in the death of Christ I live  
  
There in the ground, His body lay  
Light of the world, by darkness slain  
Then bursting forth in glorious day  
Up from the grave, He rose again  
And as He stands in victory  
Sin’s curse has lost its grip on me  
For I am His and He is mine  
Bought with the precious blood of Christ  
  
No guilt in life, no fear in death  
This is the power of Christ in me  
From life’s first cry to final breath  
Jesus commands my destiny  
No pow’r of hell, no scheme of man  
Can ever pluck me from His hand  
‘Til He returns or calls me home  
Here in the power of Christ I’ll stand  
  
No power of hell, no scheme of man  
Can ever pluck me from His hand  
‘Til He returns or calls me home  
Here in the power of Christ I’ll stand
