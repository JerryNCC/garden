### <center>以斯帖王后</center>

> [!info]- 🎙️Audio: [A Daily Devotional - 06.11 - CN]()


在查尔斯·狄更斯的小说《远大前程》中，有一个贯穿始终的主题——神秘的恩人。主角匹普在成长过程中，不断受到一位身份不明之人的帮助。这人从不露面，总是在幕后默默地给予与看顾。圣经中的《以斯帖记》也有类似的情节。全书中并没有明确提到“神”这个名字，但若仔细阅读，就能清楚看见神隐秘的手迹贯穿其间。

波斯王亚哈随鲁起意另立王后。他的臣仆们提议一个只有国王才能执行的计划：从全国各地召聚女子，轮番带到王前，让王从中选取一人为妻。亚哈随鲁王觉得此计甚好，于是便开始这场古代选后的“竞赛”。

在被带进宫廷的女子当中，有一个犹大人，名叫以斯帖。她是被掳之民，由年长的表兄末底改抚养长大。末底改是当年尼布甲尼撒将人掳走时留下的遗民之一。圣经记载，以斯帖容貌俊美，自然被选中参与王的甄选。接下来发生的事令人惊奇——这位流亡的犹太女子竟赢得王的宠爱，被立为王后。神的百姓中的一位女儿，如今戴上王冠，坐在波斯王的王宫中。

但她有一个秘密——她从未向任何人提及自己的犹太人身份。读者不禁要问：这秘密会不会成为她的祸患？若有一日真相被揭露，她将面临什么样的后果？

然而，在这背后有更深的旨意。以斯帖登上王位，不是偶然。我们尚未明白神的计划为何，但有一点是肯定的——神在默默工作，即便是在异邦帝王的宫廷中。我们将很快看见，他的旨意乃是要保护他自己的百姓。

> [!important]+ 反思与回应
若你是属耶稣的，你可以确信，神如今也在你生命中动工。即使你暂时看不见，即使你还不明白，他的手仍在带领你。今日就向神祷告，求他赐你信心，使你能信靠他的计划，不只是为你自己的益处，更是为了他百姓的益处。求主帮助你，即便在不明白的时刻，也仍然信靠他。

### <center>Queen Esther</center>

> [!question]+ Review
> 1. ⁠Why is the book of Esther considered part of the Bible, even though it never directly mentions God? What does this teach us about God's presence?
> 2. ⁠What role does the removal of Queen Vashti play in the story of Esther? How does it prepare the way for Esther’s entrance?
> 3. The chapter mentions God’s people living in exile. How do you see evidence of God’s care even in difficult circumstances? What does that mean for your own faith?

📖 **Passage to read**: ==Esther 02==

> [!info]- 🎙️Audio: [A Daily Devotional - 06.11 - EN]()  


Throughout Great Expectations by Charles Dickens, there's a theme that keeps coming up: the mysterious benefactor. Pip, the main character, finds himself being helped by someone he doesn't know. This person stays in the background—quiet, unseen—but always giving. In many ways, the book of Esther in the Bible shows us something similar. God’s name isn’t mentioned in the whole book. Still, when you look closely, you can see his hidden hand guiding everything.

King Ahasuerus, the ruler of Persia, starts looking for a new queen. His advisors suggest a plan that only a king could pull off. They gather the most beautiful women from across the land and bring them to the king—one by one—so he can choose a wife. The king agrees, and the search begins.

Among those chosen is a young woman named Esther. She’s a Jewish exile, being raised by Mordecai, her older cousin. He remembers being taken from Jerusalem when the Babylonians attacked. Esther is beautiful—so beautiful, in fact, that she’s quickly selected for the king’s search. What happens next is amazing. Esther, a young Jewish woman in exile, wins the king’s heart. She becomes queen. A daughter of God’s people now wears a royal crown in the palace of the Persian king.

But there’s a secret. Esther hasn’t told anyone she’s a Jew. And we’re left with questions. Will this come back to trouble her? What will happen when people find out?

Still, something bigger is going on. Esther is on the throne for a reason. We don’t know yet what God is planning, but it’s clear he’s moving behind the scenes. His quiet, faithful hand is there—even in the royal court of a foreign empire. We will soon see that God’s purpose is to protect and care for his people.

> [!important]+ Reflect and Respond
If you trust in Jesus, you can be sure that God is at work in your life too. Even when you don’t see it. Even when you don’t understand. Pray today that you’ll trust his plan—for your good and for the good of others through you. Ask him to help you believe, even when things don’t make sense.
