### <center>雅各——诡诈者  </center>

> [!info]- 🎙️Audio: [A Daily Devotional - 01.20 - CN]()

在圣经中，人的名字通常揭示了他们的性格，而雅各的名字就是一个很好的例子。他的故事让我们更深入地了解他的为人，而他的确不负其名。“雅各”意为“诡诈者”或“抓夺者”，这正是他所表现出的样子。  

这一章的开头讲述了雅各的母亲利百加偷听到以撒与以扫的谈话。以撒正在准备将祝福赐予以扫——这是关乎神对以扫未来应许的一项神圣而重大的宣告。然而，利百加暗中策划，想让雅各取代以扫获得这份祝福。在以扫外出打猎时，雅各假扮成他的哥哥，用诡计骗取了几乎失明的父亲的祝福，而这祝福本应是给以扫的。  

这份祝福非同小可，其中包含了神的应许，回响着神赐给亚伯拉罕的盟约：“咒诅你的，必受咒诅；为你祝福的，必蒙祝福”（创世记27:29）。通过欺骗，雅各成为神应许的继承者，这应许最初是赐给他的祖父亚伯拉罕的。当以扫发现真相后，他怒不可遏。尽管因为尊重父亲，他没有立刻杀死雅各，但他发誓在以撒去世后要取雅各性命。最终，利百加为了保护雅各，送他远离家乡。  

在这样的情景中，你是否会为神感到难过？看看他选择合作的这些人吧！雅各是个骗子、诡诈者、自私的算计者。如果我们是神，可能会后悔当初向亚伯拉罕所做的承诺。但神不是我们，他始终忠于他的应许——这并不是因为雅各配得，而是因为神决定信守诺言。这对我们今天来说是何等令人鼓舞的真理！神是守约的神。尽管我们和雅各一样不配得，他仍通过耶稣基督向我们提供永生的应许。  

> [!important]+ 反思与回应
神按我们的本相接纳我们。罗马书5:8提醒我们，“当我们还作罪人的时候，基督为我们死了。”然而，正如雅各的故事所示，神并不让我们停留在罪中。神对雅各信守承诺，但他并不允许雅各继续作个诡诈者。同样地，神爱我们原本的样子，但他更爱我们到一个地步，不愿让我们保持不变。今天赞美他对我们的信实吧，并祈求他每日更新我们的心，使我们越来越像救主耶稣。

### <center>Jacob the Deceiver</center>

> [!question]+ Review
> 1. According to Genesis 24:1-9, why does Abraham not want Isaac to marry a Canaanite woman?  
> 2. Why is Abraham concerned that Isaac might stay in his wife’s homeland? How does this reflect his faith in God’s promise?  
> 3. How does God demonstrate his control over the details in this chapter? How does the encounter between Eliezer and Rebekah show God’s guidance?

📖 **Passage to read**: ==Genesis 27==

> [!info]- 🎙️Audio: [A Daily Devotional - 01.20 - EN]()

In the Bible, names often reveal a lot about a person, and Jacob is no exception. His story gives us a closer look at his character, and he certainly lives up to his name. Jacob means "deceiver" or "grabber," and that’s exactly who he is.  

The chapter starts with Rebekah, Jacob’s mother, overhearing a conversation between Isaac and Esau. Isaac is preparing to give Esau his blessing—a sacred and significant pronouncement of God’s promises for Esau’s future. But Rebekah comes up with a plan to secure the blessing for Jacob instead. While Esau is out hunting, Jacob pretends to be his older brother. Disguised and deceptive, he tricks his nearly blind father into giving him the blessing meant for Esau.  

This blessing is no small thing. It’s filled with promises from God, echoing the covenant given to Abraham: “Cursed be everyone who curses you, and blessed be everyone who blesses you” (Genesis 27:29). By deceit, Jacob becomes the heir to God’s promises first made to his grandfather Abraham. When Esau realizes what’s happened, he’s furious. Although he doesn’t kill Jacob immediately—out of respect for his father—he vows to do so after Isaac’s death. In the end, Rebekah sends Jacob away to protect him.  

Do you ever feel sorry for God in situations like this? Look at the people he chooses to work through! Jacob is a liar, a cheater, and a selfish schemer. If we were in God’s position, we might regret making promises to Abraham in the first place. But that’s not who God is. He remains faithful to his promises—not because Jacob deserves it, but because God has decided to keep his word. What an encouraging truth for us today! God is a promise-keeping God. Even though we don’t deserve his blessings any more than Jacob did, he offers us the promise of eternal life through Jesus Christ.  

> [!important]+ Reflect and Respond
God meets us where we are, just as we are. Romans 5:8 reminds us that Jesus died for us “while we were still sinners.” But as we’ll see in Jacob’s story, God doesn’t leave us in our sin. God is faithful to Jacob, but he doesn’t let Jacob stay a deceiver forever. Similarly, God loves us as we are, but he loves us too much to leave us unchanged. Praise him today for his faithfulness, and ask him to shape your heart, making you more like Jesus each day.
