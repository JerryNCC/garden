### <center>恩典的奇迹</center>

> [!info]- 🎙️Audio: [None]()

想象在一座公共泳池旁，有个学步中的小女孩。她不知不觉离开父母身边，一脚踩空跌入水中。起初没有人察觉，过了几秒钟，才有人惊呼，大人们立刻跳入水里，把她救上岸。感谢上帝，这个孩子最终毫发无伤。

这是一个被拯救的美好例子，但若要形容我们在基督里的永恒救恩，却并不恰当。保罗这样描述以弗所人得救之前的光景：“你们死在过犯罪恶之中”（参弗2:1–2）。当耶稣找到我们时，我们并不是在水中挣扎求救，而是已经死了——像沉在海底、毫无气息的尸体。

我们常常对“得救”有错误的想象。我们知道自己需要救恩，但在心里却以为：我们是快要淹死的人，耶稣来伸出援手，扶我们一把，让我们继续往前游。朋友，圣经所启示的救恩，远比这更严肃、更奇妙。

当耶稣拯救我们时，我们里面并没有什么可夸的善行。我们不是在挣扎，我们是已经死亡的人。保罗说，我们“本为可怒之子，和别人一样”（参弗2:3）。离了基督，我们并非“基本上还算不错，只是需要一点属灵帮助”的人，而是因罪而当受审判、理当承受神忿怒的人。我们需要的不是小小的协助，而是一场彻底的、来自上帝的恩典奇迹。

接着在第4节，出现了有人称之为整本圣经中最美的一个转折：“然而，神……”这位满有怜悯的神，借着祂儿子耶稣的死与复活，使这些属灵上已经死亡的罪人重新活过来。福音并不是对“还不错的人”发出的温馨鼓励，要他们变得更好一点；福音是宣告：那位本来在神震怒之下、毫无盼望的罪人，如今可以在基督里得着新生命和完全的赦免。这就是为什么保罗会情不自禁，在话语中插入那句感叹：“你们得救是本乎恩！”（参弗2:5）

> [!important]+ 反思与回应
如果你自小在基督徒家庭长大，经常出入教会，也许就更需要常常被提醒：若没有神在基督里的恩典，你原本也是死在罪中的“可怒之子”。但如今，不再是这样了——你已经在基督里活了过来，因祂的十字架得着完全的赦免。为此，理当向神献上衷心的赞美与感恩。

### <center>A Miracle of Grace</center>

📖 **Passage to read**: ==Ephesians 02:01-10==

> [!info]- 🎙️Audio: [None]()  


Imagine a toddler wandering near a public pool. She slips into the water, unnoticed at first. Moments later someone sees her, shouts, and several adults jump in to pull her out. She is rescued, and thankfully she is safe.

That is a touching story of being saved, but it is _not_ an accurate picture of the salvation we have in Christ. Paul describes the condition of the Ephesians before Jesus saved them: “You were dead in the trespasses and sins in which you once walked” (2:1–2). When Jesus found us, we were not struggling or calling for help. We were dead—lifeless at the bottom of the ocean.

Too often we misunderstand what salvation means. We know Jesus saves. But we sometimes imagine that he saves us by giving us help—help to swim better, help to keep our heads above water. Scripture tells a very different story.

There was nothing good in us when Jesus saved us. We were not drowning; we were dead. Paul says we were “by nature children of wrath, like the rest of mankind” (2:3). Apart from Jesus, we were not basically good people who needed a little guidance. We stood under God’s wrath because of our sin. We didn’t need assistance—we needed a miracle of grace.

Then comes verse 4 with what many call the most beautiful phrase in the Bible: “But God …” God, rich in mercy, makes dead sinners alive through the death and resurrection of Jesus. The gospel is not a message for decent people who need improvement. It is the announcement that God gives life and full forgiveness to people who were hopelessly sinful, under judgment, and spiritually dead. No wonder Paul breaks into his own sentence to declare, “By grace you have been saved” (2:5).

> [!important]+ Reflect and Respond
If you grew up in a Christian home or have been around church for a long time, you may especially need this reminder. Apart from Christ, you were dead in sin and under God’s wrath. But now—not anymore! You have been made alive with Christ and completely forgiven through his cross. Give thanks to God for this amazing grace.
