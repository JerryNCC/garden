### <center>巴兰与会说话的驴</center>

> [!info]- 🎙️Audio: [A Daily Devotional - 02.26 - CN]()

当以色列人漂流在旷野时，周围有许多其他国家。在《民数记》22-24章中，我们看到一个奇特且有些幽默的故事，讲述了摩押王巴勒以及他通过一位名叫巴兰的先知试图诅咒上帝子民的失败尝试。

《民数记》22章一开始，我们就能清楚地看到，上帝对祂子民的保护和祝福并没有被周围的民族忽视。至少有一个人——摩押王巴勒——注意到了这一点，并且因害怕自己民族的安全而感到恐慌。于是，巴勒决定雇佣巴兰去诅咒以色列人，并让神灵的力量降临在他们身上，毁灭他们。他派遣使者前去找巴兰。

巴兰是一个既有趣又令人困惑的人物。随着故事的展开，我们会发现，上帝确实赐给了他要说的话；他不是一个说谎的假先知。但是，我们也会看到，尽管巴兰口中传讲的是上帝的话语，但他与上帝之间并没有真正的关系，也没有敬畏神。他关注的只是自己，尤其是他自己的利益。

当巴兰沿路前往巴勒的地方时，发生了一件奇怪而震惊的事情。巴兰的驴居然开口与他说话！当他们行进时，驴看见一位天使站在路上，准备夺走巴兰的生命。巴兰仍然不停地鞭打驴，责怪它不前进，这时，上帝奇迹般地打开了驴的口，让它说话，二者开始了简短的对话。在这一刻，上帝给巴兰——以及我们——上了一课。巴兰，正如我们接下来会发现的，是一个充满骄傲和自私的人。他认为，因为上帝通过他说话，他是特别的，值得尊敬的。但上帝让他明白，祂并不需要依赖某个人或某个特殊的存在来成就祂的旨意。上帝可以使用任何人、任何事物，甚至一只驴，来完成祂的计划。

> [!important]+ 反思与回应
上帝必定会实现祂在这个世界上的荣耀计划，即使这意味着要通过一只卑微的动物来传达祂的话语！但上帝也想要使用你。祂希望你成为祂的器皿，将祂的话语传递给他人，并成就祂在这世界中的使命。今天，祈求上帝使你成为祂谦卑的仆人。记住，你是因着恩典得救的，且同样因恩典被邀请参与上帝在这个世界上的工作。

📖 **Passage to read**: ==Numbers 22==

> [!info]- 🎙️Audio: [A Daily Devotional - 02.26 - EN]()  

While the Israelites wandered in the wilderness, many other nations surrounded them. In Numbers 22-24, we find a strange and somewhat humorous story about the king of one of these nations and his failed attempts to curse God’s people through a prophet named Balaam.

When Numbers 22 begins, it is clear that God’s protection and blessing on His people has not gone unnoticed by the surrounding nations. One man—Balak, the king of Moab—has seen it and fears for the safety of his people. So, Balak decides to hire Balaam to curse the Israelites and call down divine power against them for their destruction. He sends messengers to Balaam.

Balaam is an interesting and confusing character. As the story unfolds, we learn that God gives him words to speak; he is not a false prophet in the sense that he lies. But it also becomes clear that Balaam, even while speaking God’s words, has no genuine relationship with God. His main concern is himself—and especially his personal gain.
Now, as Balaam makes his way to meet Balak, a strange and shocking event happens on the road. Balaam’s donkey speaks to him! As they travel, the donkey sees an angel blocking their path, ready to take Balaam’s life. When Balaam keeps hitting the donkey for not moving, God miraculously opens the donkey’s mouth, and the two have a brief conversation. In this moment, God teaches Balaam—and us—a vital lesson. Balaam, as we’ll see, is a man full of pride and selfish ambition. He believes that because God speaks through him, he is special and worthy of great honor. But God shows him that He doesn’t need to use anyone special to accomplish His will. God can use anyone or anything, even a donkey, to carry out His purposes.

> [!important]+ Reflect and Respond
God will fulfill His glorious plans in this world, even if that means speaking through a humble animal. But God also wants to use you. He desires to use you to speak His words to others and to accomplish His purposes in the world. Today, pray that God would make you a humble servant. Remember, you are saved by grace, and by that same grace, you are invited to join God’s mission in this world.
