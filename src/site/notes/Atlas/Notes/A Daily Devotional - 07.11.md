### <center>凡有气息的都要赞美耶和华</center>

> [!info]- 🎙️Audio: [A Daily Devotional - 07.11 - CN]()

诗篇第一百五十篇以响亮、喜乐的颂赞为整卷诗篇画上完美句号。全诗共出现了十三次“赞美”，主题显而易见——这是一首呼召神子民尽情、欢腾、喜乐地颂赞创造主和救赎主的诗篇。虽然主题清晰，我们却时常在应用这篇诗时感到困难；读起来似乎重复，我们也可能不知道当如何回应。

但诗篇一百五十篇本身其实已经给了我们答案。它首先告诉我们*在哪里*赞美神——在祂的圣所，也就是神的子民聚集敬拜祂的地方；接着是*为何*要赞美祂——因祂的大能作为和极美伟大的属性（诗150:2）；再来是*如何*赞美祂——用各样的乐器，有号筒、有鼓瑟、弹琴，还有响亮的钹（诗150:3, 5）；最后是*谁*要赞美祂——“凡有气息的都要赞美耶和华”（诗150:6）。这就意味着，所有活着的人，无论何处，都当颂赞耶和华。而贯穿整首诗篇的，还有一个未被明言却极其明显的呼召：以热切的心来赞美神。这是一种充满活力、全心投入、毫不保留的敬拜。神的子民当以一切所有，时时赞美祂。

不过，为了真正明白并应用这首诗，我们还需要重新思想“赞美”的本质。首先，我们要明白神并不*需要*我们的赞美。祂本为全足，祂的荣耀不因人的敬拜而增加分毫。第二，虽神不需要我们的赞美，祂却*喜悦*我们的赞美。祂喜爱听见祂百姓口中发出的诗歌、祷告、称谢与颂赞。第三，我们要认识到，赞美神其实是*对我们有益的*。它塑造我们的心灵，使我们常想起神的良善，也叫我们的灵魂得着盼望与喜乐。

因此，诗篇一百五十篇并不是列出一些命令，要我们满足神的缺乏。它乃是对神恩典的回应，是鼓励我们用合宜的方式回应祂——用喜乐满溢、热情洋溢的赞美来荣耀祂。这也是对我们心灵、生命最有益的事。

> [!important]+ 反思与回应
所以今天，向神举心吧！开口述说祂的良善，高唱祂奇妙的作为，与众圣徒一同敬拜祂。让我们凡有气息的，都赞美耶和华！

> [!question]+ Review
> 1. ⁠How does David describe God's knowledge of him and God's presence in Psalm 139? What does this teach you about who God is?
> 2. Why does David praise God for being "fearfully and wonderfully made"? What does this say about how we should view our own lives?
> 3. When facing evil, what kind of prayer does David make to God? How does this shape our response to sin and injustice in the world?

📖 **Passage to read**: ==Psalm 150==

> [!info]- 🎙️Audio: [A Daily Devotional - 07.11 - EN]()  

Psalm 150 ends the book of Psalms with a loud and joyful shout. It repeats the word “praise” thirteen times. So we don’t need to guess what this psalm is about—it’s all about praising God. The whole tone is one of overflowing joy and celebration. Still, when we read a psalm like this, we might wonder how to connect with it. It can seem repetitive, and we might not know how to respond.

The psalm gives us several answers. First, it tells us *where* to praise God: in his sanctuary, where his people gather to worship. Second, it tells us *why*: because of who God is and what he has done—“his excellent greatness” (v. 2). Third, it tells us *how*: with all kinds of music—trumpets, harps, strings, and loud cymbals. Finally, it tells us *who*: “everything that has breath” should praise the Lord (v. 6). That means everyone, everywhere. And there’s one more idea running through every verse: this praise should be full of life. It should be energetic, joyful, and wholehearted. We’re called to praise God with all that we have, all the time.

But to really understand this psalm, we need to think more about praise itself. First, God doesn’t *need* our praise. He is complete in himself. He doesn’t become greater or more glorious because we praise him. Second, even though God doesn’t need our praise, he *wants* it. He delights in hearing the voices of his people—our songs, our prayers, our words of thanks. Third, we need to know that praising God is *good for us*. It shapes our hearts. It reminds us of who God is. It fills our souls with hope and joy.

So Psalm 150 is not about forcing us to give something to God that he lacks. It’s inviting us to respond rightly to God’s grace. He has poured out his love and mercy through Jesus. He’s given us new life. The best response is joyful, heartfelt praise. And when we praise him, we’re doing the best thing for our souls.

So today, lift your heart to God. Speak of his goodness. Sing of his mighty works. Join with others to worship him. Let every breath be filled with praise.
