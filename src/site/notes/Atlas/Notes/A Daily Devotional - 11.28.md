### <center>好牧者的恩赐</center>

> [!info]- 🎙️Audio: [None]()

如果你在教会待过一段时间，你大概听过牧师引用过这段经文。这是许多相信圣经讲道的牧者最喜欢的经文之一。但当你读到保罗对提摩太的吩咐——要传讲神的话——你可能会觉得难以产生共鸣。也许你从未想过自己会成为传道人，更不可能考虑全职牧养事工。然而，这段吩咐对每一位信徒都有意义。

首先，这段经文可以帮助你找到合适的教会。如果你爱耶稣，相信神的话，你就希望加入一个重视圣经讲道的群体。你希望所在的教会能够以圣经的权柄为基础进行责备、劝戒和劝勉。你希望有一位牧师，将保罗的话当作自己的牧养使命，认真服事会众。

其次，这段经文也告诉我们如何鼓励牧师。保罗提醒提摩太，人们并不总愿意听忠心的讲道；大多数时候，他们更愿意听迎合自己私欲、满足“耳朵癢”的教导（4:3）。你可以通过认真听牧师的讲道——无论平凡或出色——并为他的忠心付出表达感谢，来支持牧师。牧师是在完成神的呼召，而不是取悦每一位只想听顺耳话的人。

第三，这段经文提醒我们，神的话是神子民最需要的。因此保罗吩咐提摩太，要全心全意传讲。神的话有能力悔改人心、开眼看真理、改变生命，并指引罪人得救于耶稣基督。我们每个人都需要忠心的圣经讲道，无论我们是否意识到这一点。

> [!important]+ 反思与回应
即便你还年轻，也可以开始为自己选择将来加入、服事，甚至可能带领的教会社区。祈求神引导你，找到一个忠心传讲神话语的教会。求神带领你遇见一位牧师，他所说的是真正出于神的话，而不是单纯迎合人意的话。这是每一位信徒都应所在的地方。

📖 **Passage to read**: ==2 Timothy 04:01-05==

> [!info]- 🎙️Audio: [None]()  


If you have spent any time in a church, you have probably heard this passage quoted by a pastor. It is one of the favorite passages for those who believe in biblical preaching. But reading Paul’s charge to Timothy—to preach the Word—can feel distant if you have never imagined yourself as a preacher. You might not be interested in full-time ministry, much less pastoral ministry. Yet this charge has lessons for every believer.

First, this passage should guide you in finding the right church. If you love Jesus and trust God’s Word, you want to be part of a community that values faithful preaching. You want a church where correction, rebuke, and encouragement are grounded in the authority of Scripture. You want to be under a pastor who takes Paul’s words seriously, seeing them as his personal calling.

Second, this passage shows you how to encourage your pastor. Paul warns that people will not always want to hear biblical preaching; most of the time, they will prefer teachers who tell them what they want to hear (4:3). You can support your pastor by listening to his faithful preaching—whether it is extraordinary or ordinary—and thanking him for it. Your pastor is seeking to fulfill God’s calling, not to please every ear in the congregation.

Third, this passage reminds us that God’s Word is exactly what his people need most. That is why Paul commands Timothy to devote himself to preaching it faithfully. God’s Word has the power to convict hearts, open eyes, change lives, and point sinners to salvation in Jesus Christ. We all need faithful biblical preaching, whether we realize it or not.

> [!important]+ Reflect and Respond
Even as a young believer, you can begin to make choices about the kind of church community you will join, serve, and perhaps one day lead. Pray that God will guide you to a church committed to faithfully preaching his Word. Ask him to help you find a pastor who speaks what God says, not merely what people want to hear. That is where every believer should be.
