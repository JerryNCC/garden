### <center>信心必然带来行为</center>

> [!info]- 🎙️Audio: [None]()

雅各书常常让基督徒感到难以掌握。甚至伟大的神学家马丁·路德也曾努力要理解并应用它；据说他称雅各书为“一封草木的书信”。为什么会这么困难呢？因为相信唯独恩典得救的基督徒，会在面对雅各书中关于善行与顺服在基督徒生命中重要性的坚定教导时感到挣扎。雅各是否在传讲与保罗不同的福音？他是否在说我们不是靠恩典得救，而是靠善行得救？对这些问题的答案是：“绝对不是！”

雅各向我们展示，真正对耶稣基督的信心会带来善行。他不是说善行能救任何人；他是在说任何真正有信心的人，都会在其生活方式中彰显出这种信心。雅各这样表达：“这样，信心若没有行为就是死的。”（2:17）没有结出改变生命之果子的信心是死的信心；这就是雅各的意思。这样的信心不能救人，因为这样的信心根本不是真正的信心！

雅各也向我们展示，真正的信心不仅仅是对关于神的某些真理的心智同意。甚至连鬼魔——雅各说——也相信神；他们甚至因为清楚知道神的大能而战栗！“相信”（在作为对某现实表示心智同意的意义上）并不等同于得救的信心。得救的信心是活的信心；是把自己的生命建造在信心对象之上的信心。雅各以亚伯拉罕和喇合为例来说明他的观点。这些旧约的信徒都对神有得救的信心——一种由他们的行为所显明的信心。从这个意义上，他们因所行的称义——不是因为行为本身得被宣告为义，而是这些行为有效地证明了他们信心的真实。

重点在这里：真正的信心会带来行为。我们是因信心得救，但信心从不会单独存在（也就是说，它从不会与带来顺服与善行的改变生命相分离）。

> [!important]+ 反思与回应
如果你对耶稣的信心是真实的，它就会在顺服与善行上结出果子。求神借着圣灵的大能在你生命中结出美好的果子。求他使你的信心成为活的、有效的、有行动的信心。

### <center>Faith That Works</center>

> [!question]+ Review
> 


📖 **Passage to read**: ==James 2:14-26==

> [!info]- 🎙️Audio: [None]()  

James tends to be a difficult book for Christians to get a handle on. Even the great theologian Martin Luther struggled with understanding and applying it; he was said to have referred to James as the “epistle of straw.” Why is it so difficult? Because Christians who believe in salvation by _grace alone_ struggle with the firm teaching of James on the importance of good works and obedience in the lives of Christians. Is James preaching a different gospel from Paul’s? Is he saying that we are saved not by grace alone but by our good works? The answer to these questions is, “Absolutely not!”

James shows us that true faith in Jesus Christ will lead to good works. He is not saying that good works save anybody; he is saying that anybody who truly has faith will _demonstrate_ that faith by the way he or she lives. Here’s how James puts it: “So also faith by itself, if it does not have works, is dead” (2:17). A faith that doesn’t bear fruit in a changed life is a dead faith; that’s what James is saying. That kind of faith can’t save a person, because that kind of a faith isn’t true faith at all!

James also shows us that true faith is more than mental assent to a set of truths about God. Even the demons, says James, believe in God; they even shudder with fear at God because they know his power so clearly! Belief—in the sense that belief describes mental assent to a certain reality—is not the same as saving faith. Saving faith is _active faith_; it is building one’s life on the object of that faith. James uses both Abraham and Rahab to demonstrate his point. These Old Testament believers both had saving faith in God—faith that was demonstrated by their actions. In this sense, they were justified by what they did—not declared righteous because of the actions themselves, but the actions were effective in _proving_ the genuineness of their faith.

Here’s the point: true faith _works_. We are saved by faith alone, but faith is never _alone_ (that is, never independent of a changed life that leads to obedience and good works).

> [!important]+ Reflect and Respond
_If your faith in Jesus is genuine, it will bear fruit in obedience and good works. Ask God to grow good fruit in your life by the power of his Holy Spirit. Ask him to make your faith living, active, and effective!_
