### <center>我们的神真是伟大！</center>

> [!info]- 🎙️Audio: [A Daily Devotional - 03.04 - CN]()

我曾听过一种有趣的说法，来解释狗和猫之间的差异，特别是在它们如何回应人类的爱与关怀。猫会想：“这人爱我，喂我食物，给我洗澡，还为我提供一个睡觉的地方；我一定是了不起的！”而狗则会想：“这人爱我，喂我食物，给我洗澡，还为我提供一个睡觉的地方；他一定是了不起的！”不幸的是，神的百姓，无论是过去还是今天，常常表现出和猫一样的态度。我们倾向于看到神赐予我们的种种祝福，然后想，“我一定是了不起的！”

在《申命记》第九章中，摩西提醒百姓，他们进入应许之地——以及进入之后的繁荣——并不是因为他们的公义，而完全是出于神的恩典。摩西预见到百姓自然会有骄傲的反应，认为他们应得这些祝福，因此在先前就警告他们：“你们进入去得这地，不要心里说，是因我公义，耶和华才把我领进来得这地”（9:4）。摩西知道骄傲的诱惑，便警告他们不要有这样的想法。

接着，摩西继续提醒他们，他们随时可能像周围的列国一样，落在神的愤怒与审判之下。以色列人不仅不配进入应许之地，他们曾经犯了罪，已经应得神的审判。摩西告诉他们：“你们不要忘记，你们在旷野如何激怒耶和华你们的神……你们向耶和华行事悖逆，甚至在何烈山，你们激怒了耶和华，以致他大大发怒，准备要灭绝你们”（9:7-8）。如果没有摩西在他们面前代求，神本可以像对待那些罪恶的列国一样，降下审判。摩西的信息非常明确：“你们得以进入这地，并不是因为你们配得，事实上，你们应得的恰恰相反！”

> [!important]+ 反思与回应
我们同样因着罪被神定罪，但神却赐下了不配得的恩典，差遣祂的儿子耶稣，为我们的罪付上代价，带来救赎与生命。我们必须时刻提醒自己，我们得救并非因为我们的公义，而是因为基督的公义。所以，当你回顾神为你所做的一切时，愿你的回应是：“主啊，你真是伟大的！”

📖 **Passage to read**: ==Deuteronomy 09.01-12==

> [!info]- 🎙️Audio: [A Daily Devotional - 03.04 - EN]()  

I once heard an interesting way to explain the difference between dogs and cats, especially in how they respond to human love and kindness. Cats think, "This human loves me, feeds me, bathes me, and gives me a place to sleep; I must be wonderful!" But dogs think, "This human loves me, feeds me, bathes me, and gives me a place to sleep; they must be wonderful!" Unfortunately, God's people, both in the past and even today, often have the same attitude as the cat. We tend to look at the many ways God has blessed us and think, "I must be wonderful!"

In Deuteronomy 9, Moses reminds the people that their entry into the promised land—and their prosperity once they are there—will not be because of their righteousness. It will be completely a result of God's grace. Moses warns them in advance, knowing that their natural response will be to feel proud and think they deserve the blessing. He says, “Do not say in your heart, after the LORD your God has thrust them out before you, ‘It is because of my righteousness that the LORD has brought me in to possess this land’” (9:4). Moses knows the temptation of pride and warns them against this kind of thinking.

Moses goes on to remind them that they could easily fall under God’s judgment, just like the nations around them. Not only did the Israelites not deserve to enter the promised land, but they had also sinned and earned God’s judgment. Moses tells them, “Do not forget how you provoked the LORD your God to wrath in the wilderness... You have been rebellious against the LORD. Even at Horeb you provoked the LORD to wrath, and the LORD was so angry with you that he was ready to destroy you” (9:7–8). If it weren’t for Moses interceding for them, God would have judged them just like the other nations who were living in the land. Moses’ message is clear: "You’re not getting into the land because you deserve it. In fact, you deserve the opposite!"

> [!important]+ Reflect and Respond
We, too, are under God’s judgment because of our sin. Yet, He shows us unmerited favor, providing His Son, Jesus, to pay for our sins and bring us salvation and life. We must remind ourselves that it’s not because of our righteousness that we are saved, but because of Christ’s righteousness. So, as you reflect on everything God has done for you today, let your response be: “Lord, you must be wonderful!”
