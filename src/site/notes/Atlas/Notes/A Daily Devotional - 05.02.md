### <center>自立为王</center>

> [!info]- 🎙️Audio: [A Daily Devotional - 05.02 - CN]()

当大卫年老体衰时，他的一个儿子看准时机，想要趁机篡夺王位。这个儿子名叫亚多尼雅，是押沙龙之后出生的。亚多尼雅性格张扬，自负骄傲，他从哥哥押沙龙那里学到了不少东西——但可惜不是好榜样。他明知所罗门是预定的接班人，却依旧执意自行登基。然而，王位不是靠自己争来的。人若想靠自己加冕为王，终究是不会有好下场的。亚多尼雅的骄傲和篡位之举，恰恰证明了他并不是神所拣选的王。

早在撒母耳记下第十二章，先知拿单曾因拔示巴之事责备过大卫。而这一次，他再次现身。这回，他是与拔示巴一同前来——拔示巴是大卫的妻子，也是所罗门的母亲。他们清楚地意识到危险临近：如果大卫不尽早明确所罗门为继承人，那么一旦他驾崩，众子之间必将为了王位而内斗，国家恐怕也将因此陷入动荡。大卫早已向拔示巴承诺，所罗门将继承他的王位。如今，拿单和拔示巴前来，是要提醒他兑现这个承诺，并劝他尽快采取行动。

大卫听从了他们的建议。他信守诺言，派遣臣仆去膏立所罗门为王，并向全国宣布他的即位。百姓听闻此事，欣喜若狂，齐声欢呼，普天同庆。神所拣选的王，大卫的儿子，已经预备好登基掌权。

紧接着，所罗门便展现出他的王者风范。当亚多尼雅听到百姓为所罗门欢庆的声音时，立刻意识到自己大祸临头。他惊恐万分，急忙逃往圣所，抱住祭坛的角，想借神圣之地寻求庇护。这是一次仓促又徒劳的举动。他的叛逆之罪，按理本该处死，即便他抓住祭坛的角，也难逃法网。然而，作为神子民的新君王，所罗门却展现出宽容与怜悯。他并未下令处死亚多尼雅，反而召他前来，任他伏地俯首，表明忠心，然后饶他不死。

> [!important]+ 反思与回应
今天，当你祷告时，请记住：我们每一个人，其实在罪中都像亚多尼雅一样。我们渴望自己作主，自立为王，抗拒神真正的王——耶稣。但若我们悔改归向祂，祂必向我们施怜悯。因此，就在今日，向耶稣俯伏，献上悔改、敬拜与忠诚，承认祂是独一无二的真王。

### <center>Crowning Oneself King</center>

> [!question]+ Review
> 1. Why was David’s census considered a sin? What does this reveal about the shift in his spiritual dependence?
> 2. In this story, how do we see God's sovereignty even over human sin and Satan’s temptation? What spiritual truth does this “apparent contradiction” convey?
> 3. What is the spiritual significance of David purchasing Araunah’s threshing floor? How does this event point forward to God's greater plan of redemption?

📖 **Passage to read**: ==1 Kings 01==

> [!info]- 🎙️Audio: [A Daily Devotional - 05.02 - EN]()  

As David gets older and weaker, one of his sons sees an opening to take the throne for himself. This son is Adonijah, born after Absalom. Like his brother, Adonijah is bold and full of himself. He’s learned a few things from Absalom—and not the good ones. He knows that Solomon is supposed to be the next king, but that doesn’t stop him. He tries to take the throne anyway. But that’s not how kingship works. You don’t make yourself king. It never turns out well for those who try. Adonijah’s pride and his attempt to take power only show he is not God’s choice.

Back in 2 Samuel 12, the prophet Nathan had come to David to confront his sin with Bathsheba. Now, Nathan shows up again. This time, he comes with Bathsheba—Solomon’s mother and David’s wife. They both see the danger. If David doesn’t make it clear that Solomon is the king, the other sons might fight over the throne when David dies. And that would tear the nation apart. David had already promised Bathsheba that Solomon would rule after him. Now Nathan and Bathsheba come to remind him of that promise and urge him to act.

David listens. He keeps his word. He sends his officials to anoint Solomon and tell the people that Solomon is their next king. The people rejoice. There is shouting and celebration. They are glad. God’s chosen king—the son of David—is ready to rule.

Right away, Solomon begins to show the kind of king he is. When Adonijah hears the celebration, he knows he’s in trouble. So he runs to the altar and holds on to its horns, hoping for safety. It’s a desperate move. What he did deserves death. Grabbing the altar can’t cover up rebellion. But Solomon doesn’t kill him. Instead, he shows mercy. He calls Adonijah to come and bow before him, and he lets him live.

> [!important]+ Reflect and Respond
As you pray today, remember: we’re all like Adonijah in some way. In our sin, we want to be in charge. We try to take the throne for ourselves. We push against God’s true King—Jesus. But if we turn back to Him, He will show mercy. So come to Jesus today. Bow your heart to the true King, with repentance, praise, and loyalty.
