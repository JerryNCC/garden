### <center>极具天赋，却深陷罪恶的瑕疵</center>

> [!info]- 🎙️Audio: [A Daily Devotional - 03.28 - CN]()


参孙是《士师记》中的一个引人注目的人物。他是身体上乃至超自然的最强壮的士师。他是一个强大的男人，神赋予了他超出常人的能力。凭借着他的力量，参孙脱颖而出，成为最具代表性的士师。但他成为士师代表人物的原因，不仅仅是因为他非凡的力量，还因为他身上显而易见的弱点——他深刻的人格缺陷。参孙的骄傲贯穿了整段故事；他常常自夸自己的胜利，却从未将荣耀归给神（见《士师记》15:16）。他脾气暴躁，冲动的行为常常让他陷入危险的境地，面对威胁时常因愤怒而做出过激反应（见《士师记》15:4–5）。而也许最大的弱点，就是参孙对女性的欲望，特别是那些不敬畏神的外邦女性。

参孙的堕落始于他对一位名叫大利拉的非利士女子的迷恋。大利拉不仅对神毫无忠诚，她对参孙的忠诚也根本不存在。她为非利士人效力，任务就是从参孙那里获取他力量的秘密。尽管参孙知道这一点，他最终还是屈服于大利拉的不断追问，向她透露了自己力量的来源。也许他开始认为自己不再需要神——即便不遵守拿细耳人的誓言，他依然能够保持强大。参孙屈服于大利拉，失去了自己的力量，最终被非利士人俘虏。他们挖出了他的双眼，并将他囚禁在监狱里让他磨面。

然而，神并没有结束参孙的故事。在非利士人向虚假的神大衮举行盛大宴会时，他们将参孙当作娱乐节目带出来。此时的参孙已经 humbled，完全依赖神，他看到了机会。他用尽全力推倒了神殿的柱子，在最后一次发挥力量时，他摧毁了整座建筑，死时击杀的非利士人比他生前所杀的还要多（《士师记》16:30）。

这并不是一个令人满意的结局，是否？参孙虽然强大，并且在某种程度上为神的百姓带来了胜利，但他依然有着深深的缺陷。他缺乏引领神的百姓走向长久胜利所需要的品格。

> [!important]+ 反思与回应
你是否在某些方面拥有出类拔萃的天赋？或许是在音乐、体育、学术、戏剧或领导力上？要小心！祈求神帮助你依靠祂，并引导你将自己的天赋用来荣耀耶稣，而不是满足你个人的欲望。

### <center>Greatly Gifted and Sinfully Flawed</center>

> [!question]+ Review
>  1. Why is Samson’s birth linked to other great leaders in Israel's history? How does this similarity reflect God’s salvation plan?
>  2. While Samson brought many victories to Israel, what were his flaws? How do the salvation he brought and the future true Savior differ?

📖 **Passage to read**: ==Judges 16==

> [!info]- 🎙️Audio: [A Daily Devotional - 03.28 - EN]()  


Samson is a striking figure in the book of Judges. He is the strongest judge physically and even supernaturally. He is a powerful man, gifted by God in ways beyond ordinary human ability. Because of his strength, Samson stands out as the ultimate judge. But what makes him the embodiment of a judge in the book of Judges is not just his extraordinary strength but also his weaknesses—his deep flaws as a person. Samson’s pride is evident throughout the story; he boasts often about his victories without giving any credit to God (see Judges 15:16). He has a quick temper, and his impulsive actions often put him in dangerous situations, responding to threats with rash anger (see Judges 15:4–5). And perhaps the greatest weakness of all, as we see in Judges 16, is his lust for women—particularly foreign women who do not honor God.

Samson’s downfall begins with his desire for a Philistine woman named Delilah. Not only does Delilah have no loyalty to God, but her loyalty isn’t even to Samson. She is working for the Philistines, who have asked her to find out the secret to Samson's strength. Despite knowing this, Samson eventually gives in to Delilah’s persistent questioning and reveals the source of his power. Perhaps at this point, he starts to think that he no longer needs God—that he can rely on his own strength and still be powerful. In giving in to Delilah, Samson loses his strength and is captured by the Philistines. They gouge out his eyes and force him to grind grain in prison.

Yet God is not finished with Samson. During a great feast to the false god Dagon, the Philistines bring Samson out as entertainment. Samson, now humbled and relying on God, sees an opportunity. He pushes against the pillars of the temple with all his might, and in one final act of strength, he brings the entire building down, killing more Philistines in his death than he had killed in his life (Judges 16:30).

It’s hard to say that this is a satisfying ending. While Samson is mighty and has brought victory to God's people in a temporary way, he is deeply flawed. He lacks the character needed to lead God’s people in a lasting way.

> [!important]+ Reflect and Respond
Do you have great gifts in some area of life? Maybe in music, sports, academics, drama, or leadership? Be cautious. Pray that God will help you depend on Him, and that He will guide you to use your gifts for His glory, not to fulfill your own desires.
