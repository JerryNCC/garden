### <center>爱你的敌人</center>

> [!info]- 🎙️Audio: [A Daily Devotional - 04.18 - CN]()

在《撒母耳记下》1章中，我们遇到了一位年轻人，他声称是应扫罗的请求，将扫罗杀死。我们知道这是一个谎言，因为在《撒母耳记上》31章中记载，扫罗是自杀的。这个亚玛力人试图讨好大卫，认为新任以色列王会因为敌人被杀而感到高兴。他大概期待得到某种奖励，甚至是一个高位的职务。

但这位年轻人完全误解了大卫。大卫不是那种追求权力、奖励作恶之人。尽管扫罗曾多次试图杀他，大卫却不庆祝扫罗的死，也不会奖励那些伤害神所膏立之王的人。当这个年轻人撒谎声称自己杀死了扫罗时，大卫迅速做出反应，命令将其处死。迅速的惩罚是因为这个年轻人杀害了神所膏立的王，神选立的扫罗。尽管扫罗多次试图害死他，大卫依然不会亵渎神所设立的王，即便扫罗已经死去。大卫的回应是：爱，而不是恨。

大卫对扫罗的尊重甚至更深远。他为扫罗和约拿单写了一首美丽的哀歌，并教导全以色列人民唱这首歌，引导他们为扫罗的死而哀悼。即使在自己即将登基为王的时刻，大卫依然在行为上表现出他对神选王的尊重，并坚决拒绝以恶报恶。大卫对敌人的爱是显而易见的，他带领以色列人尊敬这个曾经追杀他的人。

是什么让大卫不恨扫罗，甚至不庆祝扫罗的死呢？是他对神的深深敬畏，以及对神所立王的尊重。这种敬畏转变了大卫的心，使他能够为扫罗的死哀悼，并且在扫罗所做的一切之后，仍然尊敬他。大卫对敌人的爱，根源在于他对神的爱。

> [!important]+ 反思与回应
当我们思考自己与那些可能伤害我们或虐待我们的人之间的关系时，大卫的榜样挑战了我们。他对扫罗的爱，是基于他对神的敬畏和对神权威的尊重。我们同样应该以对神的爱作为动力，去爱那些伤害我们的人。毕竟，我们曾是神的敌人，因为我们的罪；然而，神通过耶稣为我们死，爱了我们——即使我们仍是祂的敌人。今天，祈求神使你爱祂的心，引导你去爱你的敌人，正如神爱你一样。

### <center>Love Your Enemies</center>

> [!question]+ Review
> 1. ⁠⁠Why did Samuel need to respond multiple times before realizing it was God calling him? What is the significance of his response to his future ministry?
> 2. How does Samuel demonstrate his faithfulness to God’s word? How does his response to God’s call impact his leadership and ministry?
> 3. As you reflect on Samuel's story, how can you prepare yourself to listen to God's word and faithfully obey it? How can you practice this listening and obedience in your personal life?

📖 **Passage to read**: ==2 Samuel 01==

> [!info]- 🎙️Audio: [A Daily Devotional - 04.18 - EN]()  

In 2 Samuel 1, we meet a young man who claims to have killed Saul at Saul’s request. His story is a lie, as we know from the previous chapter in 1 Samuel 31, where Saul takes his own life. This young Amalekite is trying to win favor with David, hoping that the new king of Israel will be pleased that his enemy has been killed. He probably expects a reward or even a high position in David's service. 

But this young man is seriously mistaken about David. David is not someone who grabs for power or rewards those who do evil. Despite all the times Saul tried to kill him, David won’t celebrate Saul’s death or reward those who bring about harm to God’s anointed king. When the young man lies and claims to have killed Saul, David acts quickly, ordering that the man be put to death. This punishment is swift because the young man killed the one whom God had chosen to be king over His people. David, despite all Saul’s attempts on his life, will not dishonor God's anointed king, even after Saul’s death. David’s response is to love, not hate. 

David’s respect for Saul goes even further. He writes a beautiful lament in honor of both Saul and Jonathan. He teaches this song to all of Israel, leading them to mourn the death of their king. Even at the threshold of his own kingship, David’s actions reflect his respect for God’s choice and his refusal to return evil for evil. David’s love for his enemy is evident, and he leads Israel in honoring the man who had hunted him down.

What keeps David from hating Saul, or even celebrating his death? It’s his deep respect for God and His chosen king. This reverence transforms David’s heart, allowing him to mourn Saul’s death and hold him in honor, even after all that Saul had done. David's love for his enemy is rooted in his love for God.

> [!important]+ Reflect and Respond
As we think about our own relationships with people who may harm or mistreat us, David's example challenges us. His love for Saul was rooted in his fear of God and his respect for God's authority. In the same way, our love for others, even those who hurt us, should be motivated by our love for God. After all, we were once enemies of God because of our sin, yet God loved us through Jesus, even while we were still His enemies. Pray today that your love for God would guide you to love even your enemies, just as God has loved you.
