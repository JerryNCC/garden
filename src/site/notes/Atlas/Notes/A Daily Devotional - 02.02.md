### <center>燃烧的荆棘</center>

> [!info]- 🎙️Audio: [A Daily Devotional - 02.02 - CN]()


摩西或许以为自己与埃及的联系已经彻底断绝了。在他杀死一名埃及人后，为了逃命，他躲到了米甸地，在那里结了婚，并为岳父叶忒罗牧羊。埃及似乎成了遥远的过去——至少他是这样想的。但就在一个普通的放牧日，他的生命彻底改变了。  

在旷野里，摩西看见了一个奇异的景象：一棵荆棘被火焚烧，却没有被烧毁。他满心好奇，便走近一探究竟。这时，正如《出埃及记》3章4节所记载的，“上帝从荆棘里呼唤他说话。”这不仅仅是一次奇怪的经历，而是一场神圣的相遇。上帝用燃烧的荆棘吸引摩西的注意，并亲自向他说话。上帝告诉摩西，他听见了自己子民在苦难中的呼求，决定拯救他们。而令人震惊的是，摩西将成为这场拯救行动的领导者。  

摩西并没有因这一使命感到兴奋或充满信心，相反，他满怀疑虑和不安。他问道：“我是什么人，竟能去见法老，将以色列人从埃及领出来呢？”（3:11）摩西并不认为自己是个领袖或英雄。他不过是一个逃亡的牧羊人。这一使命对他来说实在是遥不可及。  

然而，留意上帝是如何回应摩西的。他并没有与摩西争论他的能力，也没有试图说服他自己有多特别。上帝给予摩西的是他真正需要的保证：“我必与你同在。”（3:12）上帝对摩西疑问的回答并不是关于摩西自己，而是关于上帝的同在。这才是关键。这也是摩西能够完成使命的原因——因为上帝与他同在。  

> [!important]+ 反思与回应
今天，这个应许同样适用于我们。如果我们属于耶稣基督，上帝就与我们同在。这是我们的信心所在——不是依靠我们的力量或能力，而是依靠他的同在。通过耶稣——以马内利，“上帝与我们同在”——我们知道，上帝永远与我们同行。像摩西一样，今天也请你信靠他。

### <center>The Burning Bush</center>

📖 **Passage to read**: ==Exodus 03==

> [!info]- 🎙️Audio: [A Daily Devotional - 02.02 - EN]()

  
Moses probably thought his connection to Egypt was over. After killing an Egyptian and fleeing for his life, he settled in Midian, married, and became a shepherd for his father-in-law, Jethro. Egypt was far behind him—or so he thought. But everything changed one ordinary day while he was tending the flock.  

Out in the wilderness, Moses saw something unusual: a bush on fire, but not burning up. Intrigued, he went closer to look. Then, as we read in Exodus 3:4, “God called to him out of the bush.” This wasn’t just a strange sight; it was a divine encounter. God used the burning bush to grab Moses’s attention and speak directly to him. He told Moses that he had heard the cries of his people in their suffering and that he planned to rescue them. And here’s the shocking part: God wanted Moses to lead this rescue mission.  

Moses didn’t react with excitement or confidence. Instead, he was filled with doubt and insecurity. “Who am I,” he asked, “that I should go to Pharaoh and bring the children of Israel out of Egypt?” (3:11). Moses didn’t see himself as a leader or a hero. He was just a fugitive and a shepherd. This mission felt far beyond anything he could handle.  

But notice how God answered Moses. He didn’t argue with Moses about his abilities or try to convince him that he was special. Instead, God gave Moses the assurance he truly needed: “But I will be with you” (3:12). God’s response to Moses’s doubts wasn’t about Moses at all—it was about God’s presence. That’s what mattered. That’s why Moses could succeed, even when he felt inadequate.  

> [!important]+ Reflect and Respond
The same promise is true for us today. If we belong to Jesus Christ, God is with us. That’s our confidence—not our strength or ability, but his presence. Through Jesus, whose name is Immanuel—“God with us”—we know that God is with us always. Trust him today, just as Moses learned to trust him.
