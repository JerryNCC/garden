#### Model Essay

To: Puan Sarina Bakar, Principal, SMK Taman Aman Jaya
From: Serena Lai, Head Prefect
Subject: New Radio Channel Programmes for SMK Taman Aman Jaya
Date: 23rd June 202-

Introduction
The aim of this report is to recommend the kinds of radio programmes that would be suitable for the students of SMK Taman Aman Jaya.

Informative Programmes
Students participating in district-level events and competitions have occasionally had their preparations negatively affected when the latest information and updates about the events are not made available in time. Having a student-focused morning programme featuring the latest information on their events would be very welcome. Students would be better prepared if they know the latest updates. In addition, a fortnightly or monthly programme sharing our students' successes particularly the phenomenal ones, would inspire more students to do better in their academic and extra-curricular activities. 

Entertainment Programmes
To keep students entertained, programmes that feature the latest popular songs and short radio dramas are crowd-pleasers. These can be plated during recess and after school hours before the extra-curricular activities begin. The music can calm or lift the student's mood. An interesting radio documentary discussing world history, culture, scientific inventions and places of interest around the world would also be a good programme to entertain as well as develop students- general knowledge.

Recommendations
I recommend that informative and entertainment programmes be aired on the radio channel in a 3:2 ratio. This mixture of informative and entertainment programmes will keep students well-informed and motivated through the day.
