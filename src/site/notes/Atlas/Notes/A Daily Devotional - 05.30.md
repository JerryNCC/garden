### <center>弃绝耶和华的律法</center>

> [!info]- 🎙️Audio: [A Daily Devotional - 05.30 - CN]()

往往在我们最强盛、最安稳的时候，我们最容易滋生骄傲、诱惑，并转离神。犹大王所罗门的儿子罗波安便是如此。\*\*《历代志下》\*\*12章开头警告道：“罗波安得立国强盛的时候，就离弃耶和华的律法，所有以色列人也随他一起离弃”（12:1）。在他权力与安稳的巅峰时刻，罗波安竟然离弃了赐给他这一切成功的神。

他骄傲的决定带来了立即且灾难性的后果。埃及王示沙，借助其他国家的兵力，攻打耶路撒冷，掠夺了王宫和圣殿的许多财宝。先知示玛雅清楚地解释了这次侵略的原因：是因为罗波安离弃了神，神也因此离弃了他（12:5）。我们在这里看到，神不会忽视罪恶，祂公义地惩罚罪，也绝不放过那些弃绝祂话语的人。

尽管如此，神在这段经文中依然向悖逆的百姓显出恩典。罗波安和犹大百姓悔改，转向神，表达了悲痛并求神的怜悯（12:6–7）。虽然神允许侵略发生，财宝被掠夺，祂却不允许百姓完全毁灭，祂放弃了彻底的灾难，显出怜悯（12:8，12）。更重要的是，尽管百姓悖逆，神依然使犹大享有平安和美好的时光。

然而，不幸的是，罗波安并未从神的怜悯中学到教训。尽管神赐给他恩典，他依旧没有改变。他继续以骄傲行事，拒绝谦卑自己，单单敬拜神（12:13–14）。最终，他死去，成为一个领受过神恩典却从未让其改变自己心肠的人。他的故事提醒我们，当我们经历神的恩典时，必须以信心、谦卑和顺服来回应。

> [!important]+ 反思与回应
即便是在公义的审判和惩罚中，神的恩典依然贯穿整章。今天，让我们祷告，求神赐给我们比罗波安更谦卑的心，记住祂通过祂的儿子所显明的恩典，并且让我们以信心、顺服和真诚的敬拜来回应。

### <center>Abandoning the Law of the Lord</center>

> [!question]+ Review
> 1. In 1 Chronicles 13, what mistake did David and the people of Israel make when transporting the ark? What consequences did this mistake bring?
> 2. In 1 Chronicles 15, how did David learn from his previous mistakes and correct his actions? What impact did this change have on the people?
> 3. ⁠Why did Michal disapprove of David’s public worship? How does her attitude remind us of the challenges we might face in our own worship of God?

📖 **Passage to read**: ==2 Chronicles 12==

> [!info]- 🎙️Audio: [A Daily Devotional - 05.30 - EN]()  

It’s often in times of strength and security that we are most vulnerable to pride, temptation, and turning away from God. This is exactly what happened to Rehoboam, the son of Solomon and king of Judah. 2 Chronicles 12 begins with this warning: “When the rule of Rehoboam was established and he was strong, he abandoned the law of the LORD, and all Israel with him” (12:1). At the peak of his power and security, Rehoboam turned away from the very God who had given him that success.

The immediate consequence of his prideful decision was disastrous. King Shishak of Egypt, aided by soldiers from other nations, invaded Jerusalem and took many of the treasures from the royal palace and the temple. A prophet named Shemaiah clearly explains the reason for this invasion: it is because Rehoboam has turned away from God, and in turn, God has turned away from him (12:5). We see here that God will not ignore sin. He punishes it justly, and He does not overlook those who abandon His word.

Despite the consequences of their sin, God shows grace to Rehoboam and the people of Judah. They repent and turn back to God, expressing sorrow and asking for mercy (12:6–7). Although God allows the invasion and the loss of treasure, He does not allow the complete destruction of His people. He relents from total disaster and shows mercy (12:8, 12). On top of this, God allows peace and good conditions to continue in Judah, despite their rebellion.

Unfortunately, Rehoboam never truly learns from God’s mercy. Even though God shows him grace, he remains unchanged. He continues to act in pride and refuses to humble himself before God or worship Him alone (12:13–14). He dies as a man who received God’s mercy but never allowed it to transform his heart. His story serves as a warning to all of us: when we experience God’s grace, we must respond with faith, humility, and obedience.

> [!important]+ Reflect and Respond
Even in the midst of justice and punishment, the gracious nature of God is evident throughout this chapter. Today, let’s pray that God would give us hearts more humble than Rehoboam’s, remembering the grace He has shown us through His Son. May we respond with faith, obedience, and true worship.
