### <center>耶稣更美！</center>

> [!info]- 🎙️Audio: [None]()

大概没有哪一卷新约书信，比《希伯来书》更完整、更透彻地向我们展示：耶稣如何成就了上帝在旧约中赐给他子民的一切应许。虽然我们不知道这卷书的作者是谁，但我们知道，他明白上帝律法中的每一部分、先知所说的每一个应许，都是一路奔向那一天——就是上帝的儿子耶稣降临在世上，为要生活、受死，并且复活的那一天。你可以用一句很简单的话来概括整卷书的信息：**耶稣更美！**  
他胜过一切旧约献祭制度；  
他胜过任何一位人间的祭司；  
他胜过任何一位地上的君王。  
耶稣是最好的。《希伯来书》向我们表明：耶稣就是整本圣经故事的高潮与终点。

在《希伯来书》第一章里，这个主题一开始就很明显。作者告诉我们：“神既在古时借着众先知多次多方地晓谕列祖，就在这末世借着他儿子晓谕我们”（1:1–2）。耶稣是上帝给这个世界的终极、完全的话语。就在耶稣里面，上帝的子民看见他的救恩得以成全，看见他救赎计划中隐藏的奥秘被开启。耶稣是那位荣耀的上帝——其实他正是上帝荣耀所发出的光辉——并且他已经借着自己在十字架上的死，“洗净了人的罪”（1:3）。

特别是在本章中，要强调的重点是：**耶稣远超过天使，更加荣耀。**  
这也许不是你常常会思考的问题，但对这卷书信最初的读者来说却非常重要。耶稣——神的儿子——与所有其他属灵受造物完全不同。他“用他权能的命令托住万有”；没有任何天使会这样做（1:3）。神称他为“儿子”。事实上，天使被吩咐要俯伏敬拜耶稣！作者引用了好几处旧约经文，不停地重复同一个要点：耶稣远远超越一切天使。他是神的儿子——不是被造的，而是从亘古到永远就存在的。他是上帝向世界所说的最后、也是最终的话。他配得我们敬拜。

> [!important]+ 反思与回应
求神提醒你：他用自己的话托住整个宇宙。  
求他帮助你敬拜他的儿子，甘心接受他作你生命中至高的主。  
为着他在正确的时刻差遣自己的儿子，来成就他对一切需要救恩的罪人的所有应许，向他献上感谢！

### <center>Jesus Is Better!</center>

> [!question]+ Review
> 


📖 **Passage to read**: ==Hebrews 01==

> [!info]- 🎙️Audio: [None]()  



Probably no New Testament book does a better and more thorough job than Hebrews of showing us how Jesus fulfills all God’s promises to his people throughout the Old Testament. While we don’t know who the author of this book was, we know that he understood how _every_ part of God’s law and _every_ promise of God’s prophets rushed forward until the day when Jesus, the Son of God, appeared on the earth—to live, die, and rise again. You could sum up the message of the entire book with a simple phrase: _Jesus is better!_ He’s better than the sacrificial system. He’s better than any human priest. He’s better than any human king. Jesus is the _best_. Hebrews shows us that Jesus is the climax to the whole Bible story.

In Hebrews 1, this theme becomes immediately apparent. The author tells us that “at many times and in many ways, God spoke to our fathers by the prophets, but in these last days he has spoken to us by his Son” (1:1–2). Jesus is God’s final and perfect Word to the world. It is in Jesus that God’s people see his salvation perfected and the mystery of his plan of redemption unlocked. Jesus is the glorious God—the radiance of his glory, in fact—and he has finally made “purification for sins” through his death on the cross (1:3).

Specifically, in this chapter, the point is this: Jesus is greater and more glorious than angels. This might not be something that you wonder about, but it would have been on the minds of the original audience of this book. Jesus, God’s Son, is set apart from every other spiritual being. He “upholds the universe” by his very word; no angel does that (1:3). God has called him his Son. In fact, angels are commanded to bow down and worship Jesus! The writer goes to several other Old Testament passages to keep hammering home the same point: Jesus is far superior to all the angelic beings. He is God’s Son—not created, but eternally existent. He is God’s final word to the world. And he is to be worshiped.

> [!important]+ Reflect and Respond
_Ask God to remind you that he holds the universe by his word. Ask him to help you worship his Son and accept him as the great Lord of your life. Thank him for sending his Son at the right time to fulfill all his promises to sinful people who need salvation!_
