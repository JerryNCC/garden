### <center>耶歇与耶何耶大</center>

> [!info]- 🎙️Audio: [A Daily Devotional - 05.23 - CN]()

神的子民近来过得相当艰难。好的君王很少，而且即使是犹大的许多君王，也未能引导百姓正当地敬拜神。战争频繁，大多数以色列人生活在外敌入侵的现实威胁中。在这样的情况下，神的殿逐渐破败也就不足为奇，尽管这仍然令人痛心。

这时，犹大的王耶歇登场了。他年仅七岁即登基，而他拥有一位非常重要的盟友——一位名叫耶何耶大的祭司。耶歇并非一个完美的君王，他没有完全消除以色列的偶像崇拜之地，那里百姓常常作出罪恶的献祭。然而，从小开始，他便致力于听从耶何耶大的教导，后者忠实地向他传讲神的话语。在这种关系的影响下，耶歇萌生了修复神殿的愿望。他意识到，作为神子民的领导者，他有责任确保神的殿得到修复，并帮助神的百姓正确地敬拜神。

耶歇决定采取行动。他在神殿入口处放置了一个带孔的箱子，指示祭司们收集所有进入神殿的奉献金，并将这些资金专门用于神殿的修复。很快，神殿里充满了忙碌的气氛，木匠和建筑工人被雇佣，木材和石料被运进殿内。耶歇认真对待自己的责任，他深知神殿的重要性，并确保修复工作得以完成，以荣耀神。

然而，当这段经文结束时，我们仍被提醒，神的审判终将来临。尽管耶歇是位忠诚的君王，以色列百姓依然继续陷入偶像崇拜、不顺服和叛逆。在《列王纪下》第10章中，我们看到神开始割除以色列的一部分土地。在这段经文中，我们也看到了神开始拿走以色列的财富。为了避免叙利亚的全面入侵，耶歇不得不将大量皇家财物赠送给叙利亚国王。

> [!important]+ 反思与回应
让我们祈祷，求神赐予我们力量和精力，花时间更深入地认识祂，并在爱中成长。求祂帮助我们借着祂的恩典，与耶稣建立并维持我们的关系。不要让我们的心灵与生命陷入破败！

### <center>Jehoash and Jehoiada</center>

> [!question]+ Review
> 1. ⁠Was Jehu fully motivated by love and worship for God when carrying out God's judgment? Why did he fail to fully submit to God?
> 2. Although Jehu carried out God's judgment, why did God still bring judgment upon Israel? What warning does this have for us?
> 3. God can use anyone to fulfill His purposes. What does this teach us about our personal faith life? How can we ensure that our hearts are fully committed to God?

📖 **Passage to read**: ==2 Kings 12:01-18==

> [!info]- 🎙️Audio: [A Daily Devotional - 05.23 - EN]()  

Life for God’s people had been quite stressful recently. Good kings were rare, and even many of those who ruled, even in Judah, didn’t lead the people well in their worship of God. Wars were frequent, and for most Israelites, the constant threat of foreign invasion loomed large. In such a situation, it’s not surprising—though still sad—that the temple of God had fallen into disrepair.

This is where Jehoash, king of Judah, comes into the picture. Crowned at just seven years old, Jehoash had one very important ally: a priest named Jehoiada. Jehoash was not a perfect king. He didn’t completely rid Israel of the high places of idol worship where the people made sinful sacrifices. But from a young age, he committed himself to listening to the guidance of Jehoiada, who faithfully spoke God’s word to him. Through this relationship, Jehoash developed a desire to repair the temple. He realized that as the leader of God’s people, he was responsible for making sure God’s house was taken care of. It was his duty to help God’s people worship Him properly.
 
Jehoash decided to take action. He placed a chest with a hole in the top at the entrance to the temple, instructing the priests to gather all the money that came into the temple. The money was then set aside for the repairs that were needed. Soon, the temple was buzzing with activity as carpenters and builders were hired, and timber and stone were brought in. Jehoash took his role seriously; he understood the importance of the temple and made sure the work was done to honor God.

However, as this passage concludes, we are reminded that God’s judgment still awaits. While Jehoash was a faithful king, the people of Israel continued in their idolatry, disobedience, and rebellion. In 2 Kings 10, we see how God began to cut off parts of the land of Israel. In this passage, we also see God begin to take away Israel’s wealth. To avoid a full invasion by the Syrians, Jehoash ends up giving their king a huge amount of royal treasure.

> [!important]+ Reflect and Respond
Let us pray that God would give us the strength and energy to devote time and effort to knowing Him more deeply and growing in love for Him. Ask God to help you build and maintain your relationship with Jesus by His grace. Don’t let your heart and soul fall into disrepair!
