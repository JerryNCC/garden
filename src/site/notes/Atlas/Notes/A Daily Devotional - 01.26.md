### <center>被罪奴役</center>

> [!info]- 🎙️Audio: [A Daily Devotional - 01.26 - CN]()

约瑟的故事继续展开，我们最后看到他在埃及为波提乏效力。我们迫切想知道接下来会发生什么，但《创世记》的叙述却突然一转。一个充满罪恶、欺骗和意外事件的故事扑面而来。这到底是怎么回事呢？

犹大，雅各的一个儿子，结婚并育有子嗣。他的大儿子珥也娶了妻子，但我们被告知他极其邪恶，邪恶到神将他处死。根据当时的风俗，珥的弟弟俄南应该娶珥的遗孀他玛，并与她生子，为珥延续香火。但俄南不愿意这么做，反而故意不让他玛怀孕，自私地逃避责任。这种行为令神不悦，神也将俄南处死。

看到两个儿子相继丧命，犹大决定拖延。即使最小的儿子示拉长大成人，犹大也没有让他与他玛成婚。他玛意识到犹大不打算履行责任，于是决定自己行动。她乔装成妓女，欺骗犹大与她同寝，从而怀孕。后来，犹大发现他玛怀孕，勃然大怒，下令将她处死。但他玛揭示犹大才是她孩子的父亲—他就是那位蒙面的“妓女”。犹大羞愧地承认自己的过错。他玛生下了一对双胞胎儿子：法勒斯和谢拉。这是多么令人震惊和复杂的故事！犹大的家庭在神面前极不正直，而他自己的行为也缺乏品格。

这一部分的《创世记》似乎在设置一个鲜明的对比。一方面，我们看到约瑟，他是一个在异乡为奴的人。另一方面，我们看到犹大，他是一个自由且居住在家乡的人。他们的处境截然不同。但随着故事的发展，我们会看到更深层次的东西：谁是真正自由的，谁是真正被奴役的。更重要的是，我们将看到神选择与谁同在并赐福。

> [!important]+ 反思与回应
犹大的故事提醒我们，自由和成功并不保证能够讨神喜悦。他拥有一切优势—财富、自由和地位—但他的家庭却深陷罪恶之中。今天花些时间祷告和反思吧，求神帮助我们无论身处何种环境，每天都能更加亲近祂。

### <center>Enslaved to sin</center>

> [!question]+ Review
> 1. Why did Jacob's favoritism create tension between Joseph and his brothers?  
> 2. How did Joseph's brothers react to his dreams?  
> 3. How did God demonstrate His faithfulness in Joseph's difficult situation?

📖 **Passage to read**: ==Genesis 38==

> [!info]- 🎙️Audio: [A Daily Devotional - 01.26 - EN]()

The story of Joseph continues in Egypt, where we last saw him serving Potiphar. We’re eager to find out what’s next, but then Genesis takes a sudden turn. Out of nowhere, we’re hit with this raw and messy story filled with sin, deception, and unexpected events. What’s going on here?

Judah, one of Jacob’s sons, gets married and has children. His oldest son, Er, also gets married, but we’re told he is extremely wicked. So wicked, in fact, that God puts him to death. According to the custom of that time, Er’s younger brother, Onan, is supposed to marry Er’s widow, Tamar, and have children with her to carry on Er’s name. But Onan doesn’t want to do this. Instead, he refuses to let her conceive, selfishly avoiding his responsibility. This act displeases God, and He puts Onan to death as well.

Judah, seeing this pattern of death among his sons, decides to delay. Even when his youngest son, Shelah, grows up, Judah doesn’t allow him to marry Tamar. Tamar, realizing that Judah isn’t going to fulfill his duty, takes matters into her own hands. She disguises herself as a prostitute and tricks Judah into sleeping with her. As a result, she becomes pregnant. Later, when Judah finds out that Tamar is pregnant, he’s furious and orders her to be put to death. But Tamar reveals that Judah is the father of her child—he was the veiled prostitute—and Judah is shamed into admitting his wrongdoing. Tamar gives birth to twin boys, Perez and Zerah. What a shocking and complicated story! Judah’s family is far from righteous, and his own actions show a lack of integrity.

This part of Genesis seems to set up a sharp contrast. On one hand, we have Joseph, who is a slave in a foreign land. On the other hand, we have Judah, who is free and living in his homeland. Their circumstances couldn’t be more different. But as we continue reading, we’ll see something deeper: who is truly free and who is truly enslaved. Even more importantly, we’ll see whom God chooses to bless and be with.

> [!important]+ Reflect and Respond
Judah’s story reminds us that freedom and success don’t guarantee a life pleasing to God. He had every advantage—wealth, freedom, and status—yet his family was trapped in sin. Take some time today to pray and reflect. Ask God to help you draw closer to Him every day, no matter what your circumstances might look like.
