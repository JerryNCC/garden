### <center>血祭</center>

> [!info]- 🎙️Audio: [None]()


整本圣经都是神的话。这意味着：如果你真心想听见神对你所说的话，就必须认真花功夫去明白旧约！好消息是，新约中像《希伯来书》这样的书卷，可以帮助我们理解旧约。希伯来书第8章，就能帮助你在心里更好地“把整本圣经拼在一起”。

从《希伯来书》我们明白，旧约里的律法和礼仪，其实只是天上真实事物的复制品和影儿。山羊和绵羊的血，本身并不能真正除掉人对圣洁上帝所犯的罪。那些被献上的动物，其实和“罪”以及“罪该受的刑罚”并没有直接能力上的关系！旧约的祭司——他们照着神的律法所献的祭、所行的礼，都是在指向他们背后属天的真实。隐藏在动物献祭这种“复制品”背后的，是有一天将要真正流出之血：那就是神自己的儿子，为人所付上的流血牺牲。

第二，我们要明白：旧约中的先知、律法和礼仪，一直都在向前指向神在耶稣基督里新约的应许。这也是为什么《希伯来书》的作者会在8章8–12节大段引用耶利米书。这段引用出自耶利米书中一个非常重要的部分：先知在那里仰望，将来神要与他的百姓立一个“新约”。这个新约会和神借着摩西所立的约不一样。它的核心是：有能力、也有用意，要带来人心真正的改变。唯有耶稣基督的宝血和他拯救的工作，才能带来这样持久的更新！

神的子民一直被呼召，不要只停留在“复制品”和“影儿”那里，而要仰望背后的真实本体。即使在摩西之约、律法时期，真正信靠神的人得救，从来不是靠自己的好行为或严格守礼仪，而是靠那位充满恩典的神的怜悯——他要为有罪的人预备赦免、怜悯与拯救。当耶稣进入历史舞台时，神的计划才完全显明出来。但通往救恩的道路并没有改变：一直以来都只是本乎恩，也因着信。

> [!important]+ 反思与回应
当你读这些经文的时候，我盼望你能看见：耶稣就是神伟大救赎计划的荣耀中心——既是为他的子民，也是为他所创造的全世界。为此向神感谢：藉着他儿子的献上，悖逆的人可以被称为义，罪人的心也真的可以被改变。

### <center>Blood Sacrifice</center>

> [!question]+ Review

📖 **Passage to read**: ==Hebrews 08==

> [!info]- 🎙️Audio: [None]()  

_All_ of the Bible is God’s word. This means that, if you are serious about hearing God’s word to you, you have to work hard on understanding the Old Testament! The good news is that New Testament books like Hebrews help us understand the Old Testament. Hebrews 8 can help you better “put your Bible together” in your mind.

From Hebrews, we understand that the laws and rituals of the Old Testament were _copies_ and _shadows_ of heavenly things. Goat and sheep blood cannot _actually_ take away sin against a holy God. The sacrificed animals had very little to do with sin and the punishment sin deserves! The Old Testament priests—and their customs and rituals in accordance with God’s law—pointed God’s people to the heavenly realities that these things represented. Something real lay behind the “copy” of animal sacrifice: the blood sacrifice that would one day be paid with the blood of God’s own Son.

Second, we need to understand that the Old Testament prophets, laws, and rituals always pointed forward to the new covenant promises of God in Jesus Christ. This is behind the author of Hebrews’ decision to quote in verses 8–12 an extended passage from Jeremiah. It comes from the point in the book of Jeremiah where the prophet looks forward to a new covenant that God will make with his people. This covenant will be different from the covenant with Moses. It will have at its heart the potential and intention of heart transformation. The blood and saving work of Jesus Christ _alone_ can bring about such lasting change!

God’s people were always called to look to the reality behind the copy and shadow. Even during the days of the covenant of Moses with the law, true believers in God were saved as they trusted not their good deeds or ritual-keeping but the mercy of a gracious God who would provide forgiveness, mercy, and salvation for sinful people. When Jesus broke onto the scene, God’s plan became fully evident. But the way to salvation had not changed. It had always been by grace through faith.

> [!important]+ Reflect and Respond
_As you read these passages, I hope you’re seeing Jesus as the glorious center of God’s big plan of redemption for his people—and for the whole world he created. Thank God that, through the sacrifice of his own Son, rebels can be justified and sinful hearts can truly be changed._
