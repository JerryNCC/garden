### <center>弟兄和睦同居</center>

> [!info]- 🎙️Audio: [A Daily Devotional - 07.09 - CN]()

“上行之诗”中最后这两首诗篇，让我们得以窥见古时神子民所珍视之事——这些事，今天我们作为教会的一员，仍当看为宝贵。这两篇诗提醒我们，要看重信徒之间的合一，要喜乐地聚集在一起，齐心称颂耶和华的名。

诗篇一百三十三篇以一句简明而喜乐的话语开始：“看哪，弟兄和睦同居，是何等地善，何等地美！”（诗133:1）神的百姓同心合一，是极其美好的事。诗人用两个比喻来形容这份合一，虽然这些图像在我们今日看来有些陌生，甚至奇异，但在当时却具有深刻意义。他说，这合一好像那贵重的膏油，浇在亚伦的头上，流到胡须，又流到衣襟。这画面虽然奇特，却是一幅圣洁的图象——正如祭司被膏立归神一样，神百姓中间的合一，也是一种属神的圣洁。

接着，诗人又说，这合一如同黑门的甘露降在锡安山上。这里大概是用来描绘生命与滋润——正如清晨的甘露滋养草木，使其茁壮成长一样，合一也使神的群体充满生机、蒙神赐福。总而言之，弟兄姊妹在基督里同心合一，是何等的美好与圣洁。

诗篇一百三十四篇则转换了画面，仿佛我们走入了古代以色列的敬拜场景。在第一、第二节，百姓呼吁那些在夜间站在耶和华殿中的仆人们——可比作我们今日的属灵领袖或牧者。他们说：“你们当称颂耶和华！”呼吁这些领袖举手向神，带领百姓敬拜。

第三节是祭司的回应。他们以祝福的话语回敬百姓：“愿造天地的耶和华从锡安赐福给你们。”这是一幅极美的敬拜画面——神的百姓鼓励属灵领袖，领袖则以神的祝福回应，使众人一同敬拜、荣耀耶和华。

> [!important]+ 反思与回应
今天，让我们为教会中的合一祷告。求神赐我们饶恕人的心，忍耐的心，并用基督对我们的恩典去对待他人。也求神透过我们在主日一同敬拜，使这份合一更加深厚。祈求神赐下更大的喜乐，让我们在敬拜中欢喜称颂祂，与主内肢体一同荣耀祂的名。

### <center>Dwell in Unity</center>

> [!question]+ Review
> 1. ⁠What two metaphors does the psalmist use in Psalm 133 to describe unity among believers? What spiritual meanings do these metaphors convey?
> 2. In Psalm 134, what is the interaction between the people and the servants in the house of the Lord? What does this picture of worship reveal about their spiritual relationship?
> 3. ⁠How does “corporate worship on the Lord’s Day” help strengthen unity in the church? What are some practical ways we can live this out?

📖 **Passage to read**: ==Psalm 133-134==

> [!info]- 🎙️Audio: [A Daily Devotional - 07.09 - EN]()  

These last two psalms in the Songs of Ascents help us see what mattered most to God’s people long ago—and what should still matter to us today. They remind us to value unity among believers. They show us the joy of gathering together to bless the name of the Lord.

Psalm 133 starts with a simple and joyful statement: “How good and pleasant it is when brothers dwell in unity” (v. 1). Being united as God’s people is a beautiful thing. The psalmist uses two pictures to describe this unity, and while they might seem strange to us now, they were powerful images at the time. He says unity is like the oil running down Aaron’s beard. That sounds odd to modern ears, but it’s a picture of holiness. The oil was used to set priests apart for God’s service. In the same way, unity among God’s people is holy—it is something God loves.

Then he says unity is like the dew of Mount Hermon. That’s likely a picture of life and growth—like the fresh dew that brings refreshment and helps things grow. The point is that unity among God’s people brings beauty, holiness, and life. It’s something we should deeply desire.

Psalm 134 shifts the scene. It’s as if we’re stepping into a worship service in ancient Israel. In verses 1–2, the people are calling out to their leaders—the ones serving in the house of the Lord. They say, “Bless the Lord!” They’re encouraging the priests to praise God, to lift their hands and lead in worship.

Then in verse 3, we hear the leaders respond. They speak words of blessing to the people: “May the Lord bless you from Zion.” It’s a powerful image of worship. God’s people and their leaders are encouraging one another, calling each other to honor the Lord together.

> [!important]+ Reflect and Respond
Today, take time to pray for unity among God’s people. Ask God to help you forgive others, to be patient, and to show the kind of grace you’ve received from Jesus. Pray that as you worship with others, God would deepen that unity. Ask him to give you a greater joy in worshiping him together with your church family.
