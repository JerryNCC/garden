# **June 30 -** **God Speaks Clearly**

Sometimes we ask, “God, where are You? Why don’t You talk to me?” In Psalm 19, David says God _is_ speaking. We need to listen carefully.

First, God speaks through the world He made. The sky, stars, and sun show God’s power. David writes, “The heavens declare the glory of God” (Psalm 19:1). This means creation is like a voice. It tells us God is great and strong.

Second, God speaks through the Bible, His Word. David says, “The law of the Lord is perfect” (Psalm 19:7). The Bible is true and good. It helps us know God and how to live right. It shows us how to be close to God, even when we make mistakes.

David prays, “Forgive my hidden faults” (Psalm 19:12). He knows he sins and needs God’s help. We also need God’s forgiveness. Jesus, God’s Son, died on the cross to forgive us. He is the “Word made flesh” who saves us.

We should thank God for the world and the Bible. They show us who He is. We can pray to listen better to God’s voice every day.

# **The Talking Sky**

Anna lives in a small town. She loves the night sky. Every evening, she sits outside and looks at the stars. They shine like tiny lights. Anna wonders, “Who made all this?”

One day, Anna’s teacher, Mr. John, talks about Psalm 19 in class. “The Bible says the heavens declare God’s glory,” he says. “The sky is like a book. It tells us God is powerful.” Anna listens carefully. She wants to know more.

At home, Anna opens her Bible. She reads Psalm 19. It says God’s Word is perfect and good. It helps people understand God. Anna likes this. She thinks, “The sky talks about God, and the Bible talks about Him too!”

That night, Anna looks at the stars again. She prays, “God, I see Your sky. It’s so beautiful. I’m sorry for my mistakes. Please forgive me.” Anna feels calm. She knows Jesus, God’s Son, loves her and forgives her.

The next day, Anna tells her friend Sarah about the sky and the Bible. “God speaks to us,” Anna says. “The stars and the Bible show us He is real.” Sarah smiles and says, “Let’s read the Bible together!” Anna is happy. She knows God is speaking to her every day.

**Reflection and Prayer Questions:**

1. How does the sky or nature help you feel closer to God? Pray and thank God for something beautiful you see in the world.
2. Why is the Bible important to you? Ask God to help you understand His Word when you read it.
3. What mistakes do you want to ask God to forgive? Pray and ask Jesus to make your heart clean.
