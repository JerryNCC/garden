在约伯记第十三章，约伯勇敢地回应了他的朋友们，这些朋友们自以为完全知道他受苦的原因。他们的主要观点是，约伯遭受苦难，是因为神在惩罚他隐藏的罪孽。约伯毫不迟疑地反驳他们，直言：“你们给我的苦难下了错误的诊断。”约伯知道自己并不完美，但他坚定地为自己的忠心辩护，也为神在他苦难中的更高旨意辩护。

约伯对朋友们的话语十分严厉，他拒绝接受他们所谓的安慰。“你们这些人啊，是用谎言粉饰，都是无用的医生。”（约伯记13:4）这些“医生”对他的病毫无帮助，因为他们的诊断完全错误。约伯需要的不是那些假冒神，指责他有不存在的罪的人；他需要的是帮助他在苦难中仍能信靠神智慧计划的人。

将约伯的朋友们自以为了解神心意的傲慢，与腓立比书第二章中所描绘的耶稣作对比，十分有益。“他本有神的形象，却不坚持与神同等为强夺的事。”（腓立比书2:6）耶稣以谦卑取了人的形象，成为仆人（腓立比书2:7）。与那些定罪指控的朋友不同，耶稣同情我们的软弱，是我们的大医生（希伯来书4:15）。

显然，约伯的朋友们判断错误。在约伯记13:20，约伯停止对朋友说话，转而向神祷告。虽然他拒绝了朋友们的审判，却仍邀请神显明他的过犯。约伯心向神开放，寻求神的面，而不是带着愤怒离弃祂。

我们的天父欢迎诚实、真诚，甚至困惑的祷告。今天，就以耶稣的名，把你的挣扎、疑问和痛苦带到神面前。求神恩典，使你能以正确的方式安慰他人。

> [!question]+ Review
> 1. ⁠Why does Eliphaz insist that Job’s suffering is due to hidden sin? Which scripture does he quote to support his view?
> 2. Is Job’s suffering truly because of rebellion? What does the article say is the real reason?
> 3. ⁠How should we view God’s will and plan when facing suffering?


📖 **Passage to read**: ==Job 13==

> [!info]- 🎙️Audio: [A Daily Devotional - 06.20 - EN]()  

In Job 13, Job stands up to his friends, who have been speaking as if they know exactly why he suffers. Their main claim is that Job is suffering because God is punishing him for some hidden sin. Job does not hesitate to respond. He tells them plainly, “You are giving me a wrong diagnosis for my suffering.” Job knows he is not perfect, but he firmly defends his faithfulness to God and God’s deeper purpose in his pain.

Job’s words to his friends are sharp. He refuses to accept their so-called comfort. “As for you,” he says, “you whitewash with lies; worthless physicians are you all” (Job 13:4). These “doctors” are no help to him because they have made a false diagnosis. What Job needs are not people pretending to be God and blaming him for sins that don’t exist. What Job needs is help to trust God’s wise plan, even through suffering.

It is helpful to compare Job’s friends, who arrogantly claim to know God’s mind, with Jesus, as described in Philippians 2. “Though he was in the form of God, \[he] did not count equality with God a thing to be grasped” (Philippians 2:6). Jesus showed humility by becoming human and servant-like (Philippians 2:7). Unlike Job’s friends who judge and accuse, Jesus sympathizes with our weaknesses and acts as our great healer (Hebrews 4:15).

Clearly, Job’s friends are mistaken. In Job 13:20, Job stops addressing his friends and speaks directly to God in prayer. Though he has rejected his friends’ judgment, he still invites God to reveal any sin in his life. Job is open to God’s truth, seeking God’s face instead of turning away in anger.
