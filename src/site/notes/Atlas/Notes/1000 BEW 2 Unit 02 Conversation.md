**[Scene: Two friends, Tom and Jerry, are chatting at a park after an eventful day.]**

**Tom**: You won’t believe what happened today. I was playing **baseball**, and guess what? I accidentally **hit** the ball so hard it flew over the **hill**!

**Jerry**: Wow, that’s impressive! Did you go find it?

**Tom**: Oh, I found it, all right... it smashed into a guy riding his **motorbike**.

**Jerry**: (laughing) Oh no! Is he okay?

**Tom**: Yeah, but he was so **excited**, he didn’t even notice at first. Then he stopped, looked at the ball, and yelled, “Who’s the pro baseball player here?”

**Jerry**: (laughing harder) Did you admit it?

**Tom**: I was about to when he tried to show off by throwing it back. But he slipped on the grass and fell.

**Jerry**: Oh no! Did he get **hurt**?

**Tom**: Just his pride. But I took him to the **hospital** to be sure.

**Jerry**: That’s the right thing to do. And then?

**Tom**: On the way there, we passed a group playing **basketball**. He insisted on joining in to prove he was fine!

**Jerry**: (grinning) Let me guess, he got **hurt** again?

**Tom**: Nope, but he kept dribbling the ball so **slow**, everyone thought he was playing in slow motion!

**Jerry**: (laughing hysterically) That’s gold!

**Tom**: I know, right? After the game, he said, “Next time, keep your **baseball** on the field, or I’ll bring my own **dangerous** surprises!”

**Jerry**: I think you just made a lifelong friend—or rival!
