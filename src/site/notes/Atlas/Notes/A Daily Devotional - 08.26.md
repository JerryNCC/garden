### <center>恩典属于众人</center>

> [!info]- 🎙️Audio: [None]()

恩典是神的恩赐，本质上并非我们靠行为所得。然而若我们诚实面对自己，有时我们会认为自己比别人更配得神的恩典。也许我们觉得自己的出身、行为或信心让我们更有资格。这正是约拿的问题。

约拿以为神的怜悯只该临到某一群人——他的百姓以色列。因此，当神吩咐他到尼尼微去传讲神的话时，约拿却往相反的方向逃跑。尼尼微是外邦大城，充满了不敬畏神的人。约拿不愿参与将他们带向救恩的事工。然而，神仍然追寻他。一场风暴临到，约拿被扔入海中，随后被神所差的大鱼吞下，三天后才被吐在陆地上。神再一次给了约拿同样的命令，这次约拿顺服了。

约拿在尼尼微传的信息简短而有力：“再过四十日，尼尼微必倾覆”（3:4）。结果令人震惊：从王到最贫穷的百姓，整个城的人都离开罪恶，真心悔改。国王也下了宝座，披上麻布，以示悔改和对神的信靠。神看见他们的悔改，照着祂奇妙的怜悯和恩典，收回了原本所要施行的灾（3:10）。

然而，约拿却不喜悦。他向神抱怨，说这正是他当初逃往他施的原因：“我知道你是有恩典、有怜悯的神”（4:2）。约拿喜欢神的恩典降临在他和他的百姓身上，但他不希望神将怜悯施与那些他认为不配的人。书的结尾仍显出约拿对神的教训未完全领受，但神的心意非常清楚：祂的恩典是给所有人的。没有人比别人更配得，也没有人比别人更不配，这正是恩典的意义。

> [!important]+ 反思与回应
祷告求神调整我们的心，使我们的心与神的心相合——为世上仍需耶稣的人。求神赐下喜乐，使我们乐意看见他人也经历你所蒙的恩典与救恩。

### <center>Grace Is for All People</center>

> [!question]+ Review
> 1.⁠ ⁠How does God’s judgment differ between the surrounding nations and His own people, Israel, in the book of Amos?
2.⁠ ⁠Why does God bring judgment on Judah and Israel even though they appear prosperous?
3.⁠ ⁠What solution has God provided for His sinful people?

📖 **Passage to read**: ==Jonah 03:01-04:04==

> [!info]- 🎙️Audio: [None]()  

Grace is a gift, and by definition it’s not something we earn. But if we’re honest, we sometimes act like we deserve God’s grace more than others. Maybe we feel our background, behavior, or faith makes us more qualified. That was Jonah’s problem.

Jonah thought God’s mercy should be limited to a certain group—his own people, Israel. So when God told him to preach in Nineveh, Jonah ran the other way. Nineveh was a Gentile city, filled with people who didn’t honor God. Jonah wanted no part in seeing them saved. But God pursued him. A storm came, Jonah was tossed overboard, and then swallowed by a great fish. Three days later, Jonah was spit back on land, and God gave him the same command again. This time, Jonah obeyed.

Jonah’s message in Nineveh was short and sharp: “Yet forty days, and Nineveh shall be overthrown” (3:4). The result was stunning. From the king down to the poorest person, the people of Nineveh turned from their sins. Their repentance was real—so real that God showed mercy and withheld the judgment he had promised (3:10).

But Jonah wasn’t glad. He complained to God, saying this was exactly why he fled at first: “I knew that you are a gracious God and merciful” (4:2). Jonah liked grace when it was for him and his people, but he didn’t want God to extend it to others he thought were unworthy. The story ends with Jonah still struggling to accept God’s lesson, but God’s point is unmistakable: his grace is for everyone. Nobody is more or less qualified to receive it. That’s what makes it grace.

> [!important]+ Reflect and Respond
Pray that your heart would reflect God’s heart—for people everywhere who still need Jesus. Ask him to give you joy in seeing others find the same mercy and salvation you’ve received through Christ.
