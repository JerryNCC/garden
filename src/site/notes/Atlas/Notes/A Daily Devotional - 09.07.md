### <center>完全的权柄与全然的委身</center>

> [!info]- 🎙️Audio: [None]()

马太在描述耶稣弥赛亚时，强调了权柄。耶稣拥有一切权柄——祂是神的儿子，是神子民永远的君王。马太反复显示，耶稣不仅有权柄教导众人，更有权柄解释神的律法。事实上，马太在登山宝训的结尾总结道：“众人看见他的教训，就希奇；因为他教训他们，像有权柄的人，不像文士。”（太7:28–29）

在《马太福音》第八章，耶稣的权柄在各方面显明出来。首先，祂医治了一个患麻风病的人，这疾病使人被隔离、受苦。随后，祂医治了一个罗马百夫长的仆人，显示祂的能力可以跨越距离和界限。当祂在门徒面前平息风暴时，更彰显了祂对受造之物的掌管，门徒惊讶地说：“这人到底是谁，连风和海也听从他？”（太8:27）最后，耶稣面对一个被鬼附的人。邪灵认出耶稣是神的儿子，因祂的权柄而惧怕，并求耶稣将它们赶入附近的猪群。耶稣显示了祂的权柄不仅在疾病和自然界，也在属灵的黑暗势力之上。

在这些神迹之中，马太也强调了那些被耶稣吸引却被世俗牵绊的人。一个人不明白跟随耶稣的代价，耶稣提醒他说：“人子没有枕头的地方可以安歇。”（太8:20）另一个人想等父亲葬了之后才完全跟随。耶稣的回应显示，跟随祂的人必须全然委身。

对耶稣的正确回应很清楚：放下手中的一切，跟随祂。面对这位拥有全权的神子弥赛亚，我们应当以全心全意的委身来回应。

今天就祷告，求神帮助你听见这位掌权的主与救主的呼召。祂舍命救赎你这罪人，唯一正确的回应就是放下自己，全然跟随祂。

### <center>Total Authority & Complete Commitment</center>

> [!question]+ Review
> 1.⁠ ⁠How does Matthew describe the audience Jesus was addressing in the Sermon on the Mount? (Matt 5:1)
2.⁠ ⁠What is Jesus’ attitude toward the Law, and how does He explain His relationship to it? (Matt 5:17)
3.⁠ ⁠What is the significance of the phrase “You have heard that it was said… but I say to you…” in Jesus’ teaching? (Matt 5:21–22, 27–28, 31–32)

📖 **Passage to read**: ==Matthew 08==

> [!info]- 🎙️Audio: [None]()  


Matthew emphasizes authority as he presents Jesus the Messiah. Jesus has all authority—he is the Son of God, the eternal King over God’s people. Matthew consistently shows that Jesus has authority not just to teach, but to interpret God’s law. In fact, Matthew sums this up in the conclusion of the Sermon on the Mount: “The crowds were astonished at his teaching, for he was teaching them as one who had authority, and not as their scribes” (7:28–29).

In Matthew 8, Jesus’s authority becomes visible in every part of life. First, he heals a man with leprosy, a disease that isolates and burdens. Then, he heals a Roman centurion’s servant, showing that his power crosses distance and boundaries. He demonstrates control over creation itself when he calms a storm in front of his disciples, leaving them amazed: “What sort of man is this, that even winds and sea obey him?” (8:27). Finally, he faces a man possessed by demons. The spirits recognize Jesus as the Son of God, fearing his authority and begging to enter nearby pigs. Jesus shows that his authority extends over sickness, nature, and the demonic realm.

Amid these miracles, Matthew also highlights encounters with those drawn to Jesus but distracted by worldly concerns. One man does not understand what following Jesus costs; Jesus reminds him, “The Son of Man has nowhere to lay his head” (8:20). Another wants to wait until burying his father before committing. Jesus’s responses show that his authority demands total commitment from those who follow him.

The right response to Jesus is clear: drop everything and follow him. To the Son of God, the Messiah with all authority, we are called to respond with full devotion.

> [!important]+ Reflect and Respond
Pray today that you would hear the call of this authoritative Lord and Savior. He gave his life to redeem you, a lost sinner. The proper response is to lay down your life and follow him wholeheartedly.
