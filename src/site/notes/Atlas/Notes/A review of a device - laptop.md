### Review: **Laptop – SwiftBook 5**

**Paragraph 1**:  
I got the SwiftBook 5 laptop last month as a gift for my birthday. I needed a laptop for studying and watching movies. My parents chose this model because it was on sale and had good reviews.

**Paragraph 2**:  
The SwiftBook 5 is fast and easy to use. It starts quickly, and I can open many apps without slowing down. The screen is bright and perfect for watching videos. It’s also very light, so I can carry it in my bag to school.

**Paragraph 3**:  
However, there are some issues. The storage space is small, so I cannot save many large files. I had to buy an external hard drive for more space. Also, the battery runs out fast if I watch movies for a long time.

**Paragraph 4**:  
In conclusion, the SwiftBook 5 is a good laptop for students. It is light and fast, but the storage space could be better. If you need a laptop for basic tasks like studying and entertainment, this is a good option. I recommend it for people who don’t need much storage.
