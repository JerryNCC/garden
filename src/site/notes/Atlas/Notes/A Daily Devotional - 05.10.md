### <center>分裂的心 → 分裂的国度</center>

> [!info]- 🎙️Audio: [A Daily Devotional - 05.10 - CN]()

想象一个名叫米歇尔的女孩，她不喜欢母亲每天为她准备的三明治。每天早上，在她整理书包的时候，她决定把三明治从窗户扔出去。然而，过了一段时间，邻居们开始注意到窗外堆积起来的丢弃三明治！她以为自己可以瞒天过海，但她错了。

我们有时会陷入一个陷阱，认为未被发现的罪恶不会追上我们。虽然所罗门的罪没有在他的一生中直接影响到以色列百姓，但在他儿子罗波安的统治下，这些罪恶却开始追上了他们，正如在这段经文中所看到的。

所罗门死后，罗波安继位（见第十一章）。百姓们来向他提出一个简单的请求：他们希望他能减轻父亲所罗门对他们施加的重负。然而，罗波安没有听从以色列长老们的智慧劝告，而是选择了他年轻朋友们的建议。这些年轻人告诉他，要表现得强硬，让百姓知道谁才是老大。耶罗波安，曾经也反对所罗门的人，看到了机会，便领导以色列北部的百姓起义，反叛罗波安。犹大人，即南国的百姓，仍然忠于罗波安。两国几乎爆发了战争，罗波安甚至召集了180,000名精兵准备与耶罗波安及以色列军队作战。但就在战斗即将开始时，神派遣了一位先知，阻止了罗波安，让他放弃了内战。神的百姓和国家本身现在都分裂了。

为了保持北国的统一，耶罗波安决定阻止百姓前往耶路撒冷进行宗教朝圣。于是，他在伯特利和但建立了新的敬拜场所。最初他这样做是为了维持王国的统一，但最终却演变成了彻底的偶像崇拜。他所造的金牛犊成为神的百姓的绊脚石，百姓们前来向这些偶像叩拜，陷入了罪中。

> [!important]+ 反思与回应
所罗门自己内心的分裂，最终反映到了国家的分裂。祈求神保护你的心，不让它被世界的诱惑和撒但的影响所拉扯。求神帮助你将一切献给他，忠心地在生活的每一部分中敬拜他。

### <center>A Divided Heart → A Divided Kingdom</center>

> [!question]+ Review
> 1. ⁠In what specific ways did Solomon disobey the commands God gave to kings in Deuteronomy 17?  
> 2. How does the passage following the Queen of Sheba’s visit reveal the beginning of the downfall of Solomon’s kingdom?  
> 3. How does this passage help us understand why no human king can fully meet God’s standard for leadership?


📖 **Passage to read**: ==1 Kings 12==

> [!info]- 🎙️Audio: [A Daily Devotional - 05.10 - EN]()  

Imagine a girl named Michelle. She doesn’t like the sandwiches her mom makes for her every day. Each morning, as she packs her backpack, she decides to toss the sandwiches out her window. But after a while, her neighbors start noticing a growing pile of discarded sandwiches outside their window too! She thought she could get away with it, but she was wrong.

We can sometimes fall into the trap of thinking that undiscovered sin won’t eventually catch up with us. Solomon’s sin didn’t immediately affect the people of Israel during his lifetime, but it did catch up with them during the reign of his son, Rehoboam, as we see in this passage.

After Solomon’s death, Rehoboam becomes king in chapter 11. The people come to him with a simple request: they ask him to lighten the heavy burdens Solomon had placed on them. But Rehoboam listens to the advice of his younger, less experienced friends rather than the wise older men. His friends tell him to be tough and show the people who’s in charge. Jeroboam, who had also opposed Solomon, sees an opportunity to gain followers and leads the people of Israel, the northern kingdom, in a revolt against Rehoboam. The people of Judah, the southern kingdom, stay loyal to Rehoboam. This nearly leads to war, and Rehoboam calls up 180,000 warriors to fight Jeroboam and Israel. But just as the battle is about to begin, God sends a prophet to stop Rehoboam and calls him away from civil war. God’s people, and the kingdom itself, are now divided.

In an effort to keep his kingdom united, Jeroboam decides to stop the people from making religious pilgrimages to Jerusalem. Instead, he builds new places of worship in Bethel and Dan. What starts as an effort to keep his kingdom together turns into outright idolatry. The golden calves he creates become a stumbling block for God’s people, leading them into sin as they bow down to these idols.

> [!important]+ Reflect and Respond
What happened to Solomon’s divided heart is now reflected in the divided kingdom. Pray that God would guard your heart from being torn in different directions by the temptations of this world and the influence of Satan. Ask God to help you worship Him in everything and with all that you have.
