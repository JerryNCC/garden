### <center>肉体的刺</center>

> [!info]- 🎙️Audio: [None]()


你是否曾称生活中某件事为“肉体的刺”？也许是某个人、某种境遇，或者反复出现的问题，总让你感到挫败和困扰。保罗在本段经文中用了这个比喻，我们可以从他应对“刺”的方式中学到很多。

首先，我们需要注意的是，我们并不知道保罗的“刺”具体是什么。学者们对此有无数猜测：是对某种罪的诱惑吗？是身体上的疾病或缺陷吗？甚至有人认为，这可能是撒但派来的某个使者来折磨他。保罗称它为“撒但的差役”，但真相我们不得而知。

那么，为什么保罗不说明呢？他完全可以告诉我们，但他选择不说。或许，他希望哥林多人关注的不是这根“刺”本身，而是他多次为此祷告后神的回应。重点在于，神要通过这个持续的试炼向保罗显明什么。

神想让保罗明白一个清楚的道理：“我的恩典够你用的，因为我的能力是在人的软弱上显得完全”（12:9）。神用这根痛苦的刺，向保罗展现他奇妙的恩典。实际上，神的能力常常在人类的软弱中显得更加鲜明。保罗在经文末尾甚至以自己的软弱为荣耀，因为这正显明了基督的荣耀和大能。

> [!important]+ 反思与回应
你是否有时会因自己的软弱而灰心？也许你觉得自己在福音事工上不够有效，或者不够强大、不够受欢迎、不够有能力。保罗告诉我们，可以因自己的软弱而自豪，因为软弱成为神彰显自己伟大的机会。求神通过你的软弱得到荣耀。这并不是为罪找借口，而是表明，即便我们有限的生命和能力，也能指向那赐生命的主——耶稣基督，带给人生命与盼望。

### <center>Thorn in the Flesh</center>

> [!question]+ Review
> 


📖 **Passage to read**: ==2 Corinthians 12.01-12==

> [!info]- 🎙️Audio: [None]()  


Have you ever called something in your life a “thorn in the flesh”? Maybe it was a person, a circumstance, or a recurring problem that frustrated you deeply. Paul uses that phrase in this passage, and we can learn much from how he responds to his thorn.

We should note that we do not know exactly what Paul’s thorn was. Scholars have speculated endlessly. Was it a temptation to sin? A physical ailment or weakness? Some even suggest it could have been a demon sent to torment him. Paul calls it a “messenger of Satan,” but we simply cannot be sure.

Why does Paul leave it vague? He does not tell us, though he could have. Perhaps he wanted to keep the Corinthians focused not on the thorn itself, but on God’s response to his repeated prayers about it. The point is what God taught Paul through this ongoing trial.

God wanted Paul to learn one clear truth: “My grace is sufficient for you, for my power is made perfect in weakness” (12:9). God used this painful thorn to reveal his marvelous grace. Often, his power shines most clearly through human weakness. Paul concludes this section by boasting in his weakness, because it shows Christ’s glory and strength even more clearly.

> [!important]+ Reflect and Respond
Do you sometimes feel discouraged by your weakness? Maybe you think you are ineffective for the gospel, or not strong, popular, or capable. Paul tells us that we can boast in our weaknesses because they are opportunities for God to display his greatness. Ask God to be glorified through your weaknesses. This does not excuse sin, but it shows that even our limitations can point others to the life-giving power of Jesus Christ, our Savior.
