### <center>从内到外的圣洁</center>

> [!info]- 🎙️Audio: [None]()


我们常常在意外表。  
这是人之常情。当我们遇见一个人时，最先看到的是外在的样子——他的脸庞、衣着、行为。但我们无法立刻看见一个人的内心。〈使徒行传〉中的这段经文提醒我们：上帝看得更深。他不被外表所蒙蔽，也不看人的表面功夫。祂要的是从内心到外表都圣洁的人。我们也许能骗过别人，却永远骗不过上帝。

那时，初代教会正处在一片喜乐与慷慨的气氛中。信徒们因着耶稣而欢喜，也乐意为祂的名彼此施予。在这群人中，有一对夫妇——亚拿尼亚和撒非喇。他们也想参与这股奉献的热潮，于是卖了一块田地，将钱交给使徒——但并非全部。他们私下留下了一部分，却假装全数奉献。上帝看见了他们的诡诈，并立刻以严厉的方式回应。

这段故事教导我们什么？上帝极其看重祂教会的纯洁。有人说旧约的上帝满有忿怒，新约的上帝满有恩典。但这段经文让我们清楚看见，祂是同一位上帝。祂的圣洁从未改变。祂的恩典真实，但祂的圣洁同样不可妥协。祂憎恶罪恶，因为罪会摧毁真理与爱。上帝的圣洁，比人的生命还重要。

我们必须记得：人无法欺骗上帝。祂洞察人心，知道我们一切的动机与意图。终有一日，祂要照着我们内心的真实来审判，而不是凭外表的虔诚。我们是否只是“表现”出跟随、爱慕与事奉耶稣的样子？还是我们真的悔改，并单单信靠祂？

> [!important]+ 反思与回应
所以，请向内看。  
你是否努力营造出一副敬虔、顺服、爱主的外貌，却在心里仍与神疏远？若是如此，就来到主面前吧。亚拿尼亚和撒非喇无法向造他们的上帝隐藏心思，我们也一样。向神承认那些让你只注重外在形象、忽略内在敬拜的罪。求祂洁净你的心，使你成为祂真正的儿女——一个从内到外属祂的人。

### <center>From the Inside Out</center>

> [!question]+ Review
> 1. What key characteristics did the early church show in their daily life, and how did these reflect their faith in God and love for one another?
> 2. Why does the passage emphasize that “the Lord added to their number daily”? What does this teach us about the true source of church growth?
> 3. From the example of the early church, which spiritual quality do you think today’s church (or your own church) most needs to recover or learn?

📖 **Passage to read**: ==使徒行传 02:14-41==

> [!info]- 🎙️Audio: [None]()  


We all care about how things look. That’s part of being human. When we meet someone, the first thing we notice is what’s on the outside—the face, the clothes, the actions. But what we don’t see right away is the heart. This passage in Acts gives us a sobering reminder: God looks deeper. He isn’t impressed by appearances. He wants people who are holy from the inside out. We can fool others, but we can never fool him.

This story takes place during a time of great excitement in the early church. God’s people were filled with joy and generosity. They wanted to give freely for the sake of Jesus. Among them were a couple, Ananias and Sapphira. They wanted to share in that generosity and to be seen as part of what God was doing. They sold a piece of land and brought the money to the apostles—but not all of it. They kept some back for themselves while pretending to give it all. God saw their deceit and acted swiftly and severely.

What do we learn from this? God cares deeply about the purity of his church. Some say the Old Testament God was full of wrath, and the New Testament God is full of grace. But this story shows they are one and the same. God’s holiness does not change. He is gracious, yes—but he is also holy and will not tolerate hypocrisy among his people. His holiness matters more than life itself. He hates sin because it destroys truth and love.

We must remember: we cannot deceive God. He knows every motive, every thought, every intention of the heart. One day he will judge us, not by what others saw, but by what he sees within. Are we merely _acting_ like followers of Jesus, or have we truly turned from sin and trusted in him?

> [!important]+ Reflect and Respond
So look inward. Are you building an image of devotion, obedience, and love, while your heart remains distant from God? If so, bring that to him. Ananias and Sapphira couldn’t hide their hearts from the Lord who made them—and neither can we. Confess the ways you have cared more about looking holy than being holy. Ask God to cleanse your heart and make you his true child—from the inside out.
