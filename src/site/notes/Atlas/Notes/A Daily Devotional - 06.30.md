### <center>诸天述说神的荣耀</center>

> [!info]- 🎙️Audio: [A Daily Devotional - 06.30 - CN]()

有时候我们会问：“神啊，你在哪里？你为何不与我说话？”诗篇第十九篇，由大卫所写，给了我们清楚的回答。神确实说话了——声音响亮且清晰。我们只需留心听，并恰当地回应。

大卫告诉我们，神说话的第一种方式是通过周围的世界。“诸天述说神的荣耀；穹苍传扬他的手段。”（诗篇19:1）“述说”和“传扬”这两个词表明受造之物本身就在发声。神的创造并不沉默，它告诉我们背后有一位大能而荣耀的创造主。

然而，神的话语并未止于此。他更直接地借着律法——祂写给子民的话语——向祂的百姓说话。大卫从创造的书卷转向神话语的书卷。他说：“耶和华的律法全备，能苏醒人心。”（19:7）在第7至11节，大卫赞美神的话语是可信的、公义的、纯净的。神的话语是世上最宝贵的，因为它指明了罪人如何能与圣洁的创造主和好。

大卫对神话语的回应是诚实的：“谁能晓得自己的错失呢？求你赦免我隐藏的过犯。”（19:12）大卫知道自己的罪，也知道自己需要救主。见证神的圣洁启示使大卫明白自己无法凭己力成为无可指责。这成为我们的祷告——求神在祂的眼中洁净我们。神通过耶稣基督——为罪人死在十字架上的救主——回应了这祷告。

> [!important]+ 反思与回应
耶稣，神的独生子，是“道成肉身”的生命。祂来拯救我们。神已经清楚地说话了。我们应当感谢祂的声音，赞美祂创造的奇妙，在圣经中因盼望而喜乐，并求祂帮助我们更专心地听祂的声音。

### <center>The Heavens Declare the Glory of God</center>

> [!question]+ Review
> 1. ⁠Why does David say in Psalm 16, “I have no good apart from you”? How does this statement reflect his love and dependence on God?
> 2. ⁠What do the “comfort of the soul” and “fullness of joy” in Psalm 16 specifically refer to? How do they help us understand our relationship with God?
> 3. ⁠In practical terms, how can we prioritize loving God for who He is rather than focusing only on the blessings He gives?

📖 **Passage to read**: ==Psalm 19==

> [!info]- 🎙️Audio: [A Daily Devotional - 06.30 - EN]()  

Sometimes we wonder, “God, where are you? Why don’t you speak to me?” Psalm 19, written by David, answers this clearly. God has spoken—loudly and clearly. We just need to listen and respond properly.

David tells us that God’s first way of speaking is through the world around us. “The heavens declare the glory of God; the skies proclaim the work of his hands” (19:1). The words “declare” and “proclaim” mean that creation itself is speaking. God’s creation is not silent; it tells us there is a powerful and glorious Creator behind it all.

But God’s speech does not end there. He speaks more directly to His people through His law—His written Word. David moves from the book of creation to the book of God’s Word. He says, “The law of the Lord is perfect, refreshing the soul” (19:7). In verses 7 to 11, David praises God’s Word as trustworthy, right, and pure. It is the most precious thing because it shows how sinful people can be made right with their holy Creator.

David’s response to God’s Word is honest: “Who can discern their errors? Forgive my hidden faults” (19:12). David knows his sins and his need for a Savior. Seeing God’s holiness revealed makes David realize he cannot be blameless by himself. This prayer for forgiveness should be ours as well—a plea for God to make us clean in His sight. God has answered that prayer through Jesus Christ, who died on the cross for sinners.

> [!important]+ Reflect and Respond
Jesus, God’s own Son, is the “Word made flesh.” He came to save us. God has spoken clearly. We should thank Him for His voice, praise Him for the wonders of creation, rejoice in the hope of the Bible, and ask Him to help us listen more closely to His voice.
