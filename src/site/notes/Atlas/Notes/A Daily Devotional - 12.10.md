### <center>基督徒的受苦</center>

> [!info]- 🎙️Audio: [None]()

读彼得前书时，你很快就会发现，要理解这封信，就必须面对受苦的主题！彼得写信给“被拣选的寄居者”——属灵上的不合群者，因为与耶稣基督有关系，他们面对受苦。具体是什么样的受苦呢？彼得的听众似乎因跟随耶稣、拒绝参与世界的罪恶行为，而遭受言语攻击、侮辱和社会边缘化。在基督里的生命给了他们对永恒未来的极大盼望，但也让日常生活变得异常艰难！那么，彼得对我们关于基督徒受苦有什么话要说呢？

首先，彼得希望我们为受苦做好准备。他写道：“亲爱的弟兄啊，有火炼的试验临到你们，不要以为奇怪”（4:12）。基督徒在受苦来临时不应感到震惊！这对我们很难——我们的文化训练我们去期待安逸，而不是受苦。然而，彼得的信息很清楚：你的救主受苦过，所以如果你属于他，你也应该准备受苦。

其次，彼得希望我们在受苦中仍能喜乐。为什么？我们该如何做到呢？我们可以做到，因为在受苦中，我们被神，甚至被迫害我们的人，与耶稣基督本身联系在一起。为跟随耶稣而受苦时，我们可以有极大的喜乐；我们“在基督的受苦上有分”（4:13）。就像使徒行传中那些因为耶稣的名受辱而仍喜乐的人（徒5:41），我们也应该觉得荣耀——能与救主一同受辱。

最后，彼得希望我们看到，受苦是为了让我们被洁净。彼得前书 4:17–18 是段难懂的经文，但彼得的意思是：耶稣基督的教会所遭受的逼迫，是神的洁净审判，首先临到他自己的子民。它预表了末日对那些“不听从神福音的人”的最终审判（4:17）。对教会而言，受苦的目的在于洁净；它能显明真信徒，也揭露假信徒。在你为受苦做准备时，最好的方法就是亲近耶稣，你的救主！

> [!important]+ 反思与回应
无论我们处于何种境况，彼得的话语对我们是：为受苦做好准备，在分享基督的受苦中喜乐，并藉此作为耶稣的信徒被洁净。将这些事情向神祷告，亲近你的救主吧！

### <center>Christian Suffering</center>

> [!question]+ Review
> 

📖 **Passage to read**: ==1 Peter 04.12-19==

> [!info]- 🎙️Audio: [None]()  

It doesn’t take long, when reading 1 Peter, to realize that you have to deal with the theme of suffering in order to understand this letter! Peter is writing to elect exiles—spiritual misfits who face suffering because of their relationship with Jesus Christ. What kind of suffering, specifically? It seems that Peter’s audience faces verbal abuse, insults, and social marginalization because they follow Jesus and don’t engage in the world’s sinful practices. Life in Christ has given them great hope for an eternal future, but it has made everyday life extremely difficult! What does Peter have to say to us about specifically Christian suffering?

First, Peter wants us to be ready for it. “Do not be surprised,” he writes, “at the fiery trial when it comes upon you to test you” (4:12). Christians shouldn’t be shocked when suffering comes! This is difficult for us—our culture trains us to expect comfort, not suffering. Peter’s message, though, is clear: your Savior suffered, so you should be ready to suffer too, if you belong to him.

Second, Peter wants us to rejoice in suffering. Why and how can we do this? We can do it because, in suffering, we are being linked (by God, and even by the people who persecute us) with Jesus Christ himself. In suffering for following Jesus, we can have great joy; we “share Christ’s sufferings” (4:13). Like the apostles in Acts who rejoiced that they were “counted worthy to suffer” for Jesus’s name (Acts 5:41), we too should even be honored to be treated with abuse along with our Savior.

Finally, Peter wants us to see that we should be ready to be purified by suffering. While 1 Peter 4:17–18 is a difficult passage, Peter’s point is that the persecution that comes to the church of Jesus Christ is God’s purifying judgment that comes, first, on his own people. It foreshadows the final judgment of the world on all who “do not obey the gospel of God” (4:17). For the church, the purpose is purification; it will reveal true believers and expose fake Christians. As you get ready for suffering, the best preparation is to get close to Jesus, your Savior!

> [!important]+ Reflect and Respond
_No matter our situation, Peter’s words to us are to get ready for suffering, rejoice as we share in Christ’s sufferings, and be purified by it as believers in Jesus. Talk to God about these things. Draw close to your Savior in prayer!_
