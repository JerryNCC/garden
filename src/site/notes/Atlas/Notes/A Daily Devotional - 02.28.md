### <center>被召唤为嫉妒</center>

> [!info]- 🎙️Audio: [A Daily Devotional - 02.28 - CN]()

以色列人还没有完全到达应许之地，但他们正在为进入这片土地做准备。在《民数记》25章中，我们再次学习到关于人类罪性和神圣洁神的一个重要教训。

这一章一开始，便呈现出一个令人悲伤却熟悉的模式：以色列人偏离了他们的神，悖逆了祂。这一次，他们不再怀念在埃及的旧日生活，而是与摩押女子结婚，并开始拜奉她们的假神。他们违背了第一条诫命——不可有别的神，只敬拜唯一的真神。这使神大为愤怒。的确，神是爱，神是恩典和怜悯，但神也是公义的，祂憎恶罪恶。神对摩西的严厉命令（执行百姓领袖的死刑）以及祂因百姓罪行而降下的瘟疫，都证明了神对罪的严肃态度。神是圣洁的，祂必定要处理罪恶。

接下来的情节令人不安、暴力且令人震惊。然而，在旧约的背景下，这一行为在神眼中却是令人喜悦的。作为拜偶像和与外邦女子结婚的一部分，有一名男子公开藐视神的圣洁，公然带着一名米甸女子进入神的百姓营地，并将她带进帐篷与她同房。终于，有一位人心里忍无可忍：亚伦的孙子、祭司的后裔非尼哈，带着长矛走向那人的帐篷，杀了那名男子和女子。立刻，瘟疫停止了。神赞扬了非尼哈，称他是“以我的嫉妒嫉妒了我。”

今天，我们不被召唤去对周围的人发起神圣的战争，也不应当把那些活在性道德败坏或偶像崇拜中的人置于死地。但我们确实被召唤，要对神的圣洁充满嫉妒，尤其是在我们的生命中。我们被召唤要像神一样憎恶罪恶——无论是在世间，还是在我们自己的心中。

> [!important]+ 反思与回应
我们都是拜偶像的人，在某种程度上，我们都曾违背了第一条诫命，敬拜过除了唯一真神之外的其他神。神的愤怒唯一能从我们身上被转移的方式就是通过祭品、通过流血的牺牲。而耶稣为我们做了这一切。祂替我们承受了那把长矛。这就是恩典——今天，感谢神的恩典！

### <center>Called to Be Jealous</center>

📖 **Passage to read**: ==Numbers 25==

> [!info]- 🎙️Audio: [A Daily Devotional - 02.28 - EN]()  

The Israelites are not yet where they need to be, but they are preparing for the time when they will enter the promised land. In Numbers 25, we learn another important lesson about the sinful nature of human beings and the holiness of our God.

The chapter begins with a sadly familiar pattern: Israel turns away from their God and rebels against Him. This time, though, they are not longing for their old life in Egypt; instead, they marry Moabite women and begin worshiping their wives’ false gods. They are breaking the first commandment—the command to have no other gods before the one true God. This angers God. Yes, God is love. Yes, God is gracious and merciful. But He is also just, and He hates sin. His severe command to Moses (to execute the leaders of the people) and the plague He sends upon them for their sin show that God takes sin very seriously. God is holy, and He will deal with sin. 

What happens next is disturbing, violent, and shocking. Yet, in the context of the Old Testament, it is pleasing to God. As part of the idol worship and marriage to pagan women, one man openly flaunts his sin before God and the whole people. He brazenly brings a Midianite woman into the camp and takes her into his tent to sleep with her. One man has had enough: Phinehas, the grandson of Aaron and a priest, goes to the man’s tent with a spear and kills both him and the woman. Immediately, the plague stops. God commends Phinehas, saying that he was “zealous with my zeal.”

Today, we are not called to wage holy war against people around us, nor are we to put to death those living in sexual immorality or idol worship. But we are called to be jealous for God’s holiness, especially in our own lives. We are called to hate sin the way God does—in the world and in our hearts.

> [!important]+ Reflect and Respond
We are all idolaters who, in one way or another, have broken the first commandment and worshiped gods other than the one true God. The only way that God’s wrath can be turned away from us is through a sacrifice, a shedding of blood. And Jesus did that for us. He took the spear for us. That is grace—thank God for it today!
