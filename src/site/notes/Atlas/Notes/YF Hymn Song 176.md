### 《我稀奇耶稣的恩爱》  

1我希奇耶稣的恩爱  
竟这么广大普遍  
像我这个罪恶奴仆  
也会蒙祂所爱怜  
  
副歌：  
  
*真是奇妙 实在奇妙  
我要歌唱 要舞蹈  
真是奇妙 实在奇妙  
我也蒙祂所选召  
  
2跪在客西马尼园内  
祈祷愿父意成全  
祂流泪不是为自己  
乃为我流出血点  
  
3我当受的一切审判  
祂亲身替我担当  
在各各他十字架上  
孤单一人将命舍  
  
4我主耶稣奇妙恩爱  
何以如此对待我  
在那荣耀光明天国  
还要称谢主爱我

1 I stand amazed in the presence  
Of Jesus the Nazarene  
And wonder how He could love me  
A sinner condemned unclean  
  
Chorus:  
  
*How marvelous how wonderful*  
*And my song shall ever be*  
*How marvelous how wonderful*  
*Is my Savior’s love for me*  
  
2 For me it was in the garden  
He prayed Not My will but Thine  
He had no tears for His own griefs  
But sweat drops of blood for mine  
  
3 He took my sins and my sorrows  
He made them His very own  
He bore the burden to Calv’ry  
And suffered and died alone  
  
4 When with the ransomed in glory  
His face I at last shall see  
’Twill be my joy thru the ages  
To sing of His love for me
