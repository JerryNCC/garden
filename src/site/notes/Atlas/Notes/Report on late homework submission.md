#### Report Sample

To: Puan Tah Kah Wooi, Mathematics Teacher, 5 STEMA3
From: Norzila Binti Wazir, Monitor, Class 5 STEMA3
Subject: Late Submission of Mathematics Homework
Date: 4th March 202-

Introduction
This report follows the completion of a comprehensive survey on Class 5 STEM A3 students' reasons for the late submission of their homework. Suggestions for overcoming this issue are provided at the end of this report.

Reasons for Late Submission of Homework
Time constraints was cited by ninety per cent of the students in Class 5 STEM A3 as the main reason for their failure to submit their Mathematics homework on time. This is most often caused by the students being given the same homework submission date for multiple subjects There is just too much homework that must be completed by the same deadline. Another common reason is their difficulty in understanding the Mathematics homework when it is done alone at home. Many Mathematics homework when it is done alone at home. Many students prefer to do Mathematics in class with their friends. They find it easier because they help each other to understand. They find it easier because they help each other to understand it better. A small group of students have stated that their extra-curricular activities at school are time-consuming and they are just too tired to complete their homework.

Recommendations

Firstly, arrangements should be made to set a homework timetable so that students have a different , fixed submission date for each subjects. Students will not be forced to complete all their homework at one go. Secondly, a buddy support group can be created to support student's homework efforts.

Conclusion
It is believed that the suggested recommendations will resolve the ongoing issue of the students handing in their Mathematics homework late.
