### <center>上帝拯救子民的承诺</center>

> [!info]- 🎙️Audio: [A Daily Devotional - 02.04 - CN]()
  

《出埃及记》中的那些灾难，听起来几乎像是科幻电影中的情节，不是吗？但这些事件却是实实在在发生的。上帝降下九个毁灭性的灾难打击埃及，只因为法老顽固地拒绝听从他的话。这些灾难不仅是审判的表现，更是向法老显明上帝是主、以色列是属于他的记号。  

在《出埃及记》第11章中，上帝向摩西揭示了最后、也是最可怕的一场灾难。上帝将在夜间经过埃及，取去全地所有头生者的生命，甚至连牲畜的头生者也不例外。这是上帝对埃及人的严厉警告，同时也是他为拯救受奴役的子民所采取的戏剧性行动。这个章节令人读来心情沉重，它展示了上帝为了将子民从法老的捆绑中救出来，不惜付出任何代价的决心。  

深入思考这个章节时，我们可以看到一些重要的真理。首先，上帝正在使他的拣选之仆摩西脱颖而出。他高举摩西，使他在以色列人和埃及人眼中成为受尊敬和有权柄的人。其次，上帝坚定地要赐福给他的子民。在第2到第3节中，我们看到埃及人把财富送给以色列人，为他们的出埃及之行做准备。第三，这一章让我们看到刚硬之心的悲剧性后果。即使法老的百姓遭受了极大的苦难，他仍然拒绝听从上帝的话，这种顽固令人难以置信。可悲的是，即使在今天，仍有许多人继续故意抗拒上帝的真理和话语。  

最后，第9节让我们看到上帝在这一切事情中的目的。上帝告诉摩西：“法老必不听你们的话，使我的奇事在埃及地多起来。”上帝所做的一切，都有一个更大的目的：彰显他的荣耀，并让世界认识他是谁。  

这个章节向我们显明了这样一位上帝：他愿意不惜一切代价拯救他的子民。他为以色列人从埃及的奴役中得释放付出了极大的代价，而为了拯救我们，他甚至舍弃了自己的独生子耶稣，让他为我们死在十字架上，使我们能够从罪和死亡中得自由。这就是我们所敬拜的上帝——一位全心致力于拯救我们，并为我们的永恒益处而工作的上帝。  

> [!important]+ 反思与回应
今天，让我们为他的爱与信实向他献上感谢。让我们祷告，愿我们的生命彰显他的荣耀，并在信靠与顺服中紧随他。

### <center>God’s Commitment to Saving His People</center>

> [!question]+ Review
> 1. What did God send Moses and Aaron to do in Exodus 4–5, and how did Pharaoh respond?  
> 2. Why did God harden Pharaoh’s heart? How does this decision reflect God’s sovereign plan?  
> 3. ⁠What lessons can we learn from Pharaoh’s hardened heart and God’s control to guide us in facing challenges and obeying God?


📖 **Passage to read**: ==Exodus 11==

> [!info]- 🎙️Audio: [A Daily Devotional - 02.04 - EN]()  

The plagues in Exodus almost sound like they’re from a science fiction movie, don’t they? But these events were very real. God brought nine devastating plagues upon Egypt because Pharaoh stubbornly refused to listen to Him. These plagues were more than just acts of judgment; they were signs to Pharaoh, showing him that God is Lord and that Israel belonged to Him.  

In Exodus 11, God reveals to Moses the final and most dreadful plague. He will come through Egypt during the night and take the lives of all the firstborn in the land, even the firstborn of the animals. This terrible and painful event would be God’s decisive action against the Egyptians—and His dramatic act to deliver His enslaved people. This chapter is hard to read. It shows us the lengths to which God would go to save His people from their bondage to Pharaoh.  

As we look closer at this chapter, we can see some important truths. First, God is making Moses, His chosen servant, stand out. He is elevating Moses, giving him honor and authority in the eyes of both the Israelites and the Egyptians. Second, God is determined to bless His people. In verses 2 and 3, we see the Egyptians giving their wealth to the Israelites, providing for them as they prepare to leave. Third, the chapter reminds us of the tragedy of a hardened heart. Pharaoh’s refusal to listen, even as his people suffered so much, is shocking. Sadly, we still see this kind of resistance to God’s truth today.  

Finally, verse 9 gives us insight into God’s purpose in all of this. God tells Moses, “Pharaoh will not listen to you, so that my wonders may be multiplied in the land of Egypt.” Everything God was doing had a greater purpose: to display His glory and show the world who He is.  

This passage points us to a God who will stop at nothing to save His people. He went to great lengths to rescue Israel from Egypt, and He went even further to save us. He sent His own firstborn Son, Jesus, to die in our place so that we could be free from sin and death. That’s the kind of God we serve—a God completely committed to saving us and working for our eternal good.

Let’s thank Him today for His love and faithfulness. And let’s pray that our lives would reflect His glory as we trust and follow Him.
