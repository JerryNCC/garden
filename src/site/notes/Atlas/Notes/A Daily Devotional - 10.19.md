### <center>**没有无可救药的人**</center>

> [!info]- 🎙️Audio: [None]()

从我们有限的人类视角来看，有些人似乎就是“无可救药”的。我们几乎无法想象他们会有一天转向基督，悔改自己的罪，并信靠祂为主、为救主。然而，《使徒行传》9章1至22节应当让我们停止这样想、也停止这样说。这段经文讲述了一个看似最不可能得救的人。扫罗不仅拒绝耶稣——他还憎恨祂；他追捕信徒，甚至参与迫害他们。他不仅不接受福音的信息，还竭尽全力反对它。可是，福音的大能，竟然连这样的人也能拯救。

回顾这段非凡的经历，有几个重点值得我们思想。首先，扫罗是亲自被复活的基督所拦阻的。在往大马士革的路上，耶稣亲自向他显现，说：“我就是你所逼迫的耶稣”（9:5）。那一刻，彻底改变了扫罗的一生。后来他被称为保罗——一个亲眼见过复活之主的人。而这事实，正是他被承认为使徒的关键，因为使徒乃是亲见基督并奉祂差遣的人。

其次，扫罗的归信与他的呼召紧密相连，两者无法分开。主对亚拿尼亚说：“他是我所拣选的器皿，要在外邦人、君王和以色列人面前宣扬我的名”（9:15）。保罗一生从未忘记这件事。在他的书信中，他多次回忆那次相遇，把那一刻视为他信主与服事的根基。对他而言，跟随基督就意味着一生奉献给祂——传扬祂的名，建立教会，为祂的荣耀而活。

最后，扫罗的转变向我们显明了福音的奇妙大能。若连这样的人都能被神拯救，那么世上再没有谁是“太远”、“太迟”或“太难”的。耶稣基督的恩典可以触及任何生命、融化任何刚硬的心。所以，让我们继续为那些尚未认识主的人祷告。神有能力行奇事，使最不可能悔改的人，因祂的恩典而信靠祂。

> [!important]+ 反思与回应
现在，请思想你与基督的关系。你——一个罪人——如今因着耶稣基督的大工，与神和好。为此感谢祂吧。然后，想想那些尚未信主的人。求神在他们的生命中也行奇事。至少为一个人祷告，相信那位曾在大马士革路上遇见扫罗的主，今日仍能在那个人的生命中动工。

### <center>No Lost Causes</center>

> [!question]+ Review
> 1. How did God use the persecution of the church to spread the gospel in surprising ways?

📖 **Passage to read**: ==使徒行传 09.01-22==

> [!info]- 🎙️Audio: [None]()  

From our limited, human point of view, some people seem like lost causes. We can’t picture them ever coming to Christ—ever repenting of sin and trusting him as Lord and Savior. But Acts 9:1–22 should make us stop talking or even thinking that way. It tells the story of one of the most unlikely converts in history. Saul didn’t just reject Jesus—he hated him. He hunted down believers and took part in their deaths. He wasn’t just indifferent to the gospel; he fought against it with all his strength. Yet the gospel, by God’s power, reached even him.

When we look again at this story, a few truths stand out. First, Saul’s encounter is with the risen Jesus himself. On the road to Damascus, Jesus meets him and says, “I am Jesus, whom you are persecuting” (9:5). That moment changes everything. Saul—later called Paul—has seen the risen Lord. This personal meeting is central to his calling as an apostle, one who has seen Christ and been sent by him.

Second, Saul’s conversion is tied to his calling. The two belong together. Jesus tells Ananias, “He is a chosen instrument of mine to carry my name before the Gentiles and kings and the children of Israel” (9:15). Paul never forgets this. In his letters, he often looks back to that day on the road as the foundation of his life and ministry. For him, to follow Christ means to serve him, to preach him, to plant churches, and to live for his glory.

Finally, Saul’s story reminds us of the deep power of the gospel. If the grace of God can reach a man like Saul, it can reach anyone. There are no lost causes with Jesus. No one is too far gone. So keep praying for those who don’t yet believe. God is able to break through the hardest heart and bring real repentance and faith.

> [!important]+ Reflect and Respond
Think about your own story. You, too, were once lost. Yet God reached you through Jesus Christ and made peace between you and himself. Thank him for that mercy. Then ask him to do the same for others. Choose at least one person to pray for—and trust that the same Lord who met Saul on the road can meet that person too.
