### <center>回归神</center>

> [!info]- 🎙️Audio: [A Daily Devotional - 03.29 - CN]()

《路得记》的开头并没有带给我们太多希望。它写道：“当士师治理的时候”（1:1）。那时以色列没有国王，没有人引导百姓敬拜神、遵行神的旨意。在这段充满罪恶和动荡的时期，难道我们能期待从这样一个故事中看到任何好的结局吗？

路得的故事始于一个错误的决定。一个名叫以利米勒的男人，他的妻子拿俄米和他们的两个儿子，由于饥荒离开了应许之地。为什么这是一个错误的决定？在困境中，以利米勒选择带着家人离开神的百姓，离开神所应许的土地。更糟的是，他带着家人去了摩押——一个崇拜偶像、敌视以色列的地方。事情变得更加糟糕的是，以利米勒的两个儿子，玛伦和基连，娶了摩押女子为妻：俄珥巴和路得。这个决定让他们更加远离神的旨意，因为他们嫁娶了神的圣约百姓以外的女子。事情还能更糟吗？

对拿俄米来说，事情确实更糟了。她在摩押生活期间，失去了丈夫和两个儿子。难怪拿俄米后来会说：“耶和华的手攻击我”（1:13）。但接下来，故事迎来了最大的惊喜。在俄珥巴同意拿俄米的请求，回摩押再婚时，路得却做出了不同的选择。路得拒绝离开拿俄米。她说出了这番令人感动的话：“你往哪里去，我也往哪里去；你在哪里住宿，我也在哪里住宿。你的人民就是我的人民，你的神就是我的神。你在哪里死，我也在哪里死，并且在那里葬埋”（1:16-17）。路得不仅选择了拿俄米，她还选择了以色列的神，并用神的名字——耶和华来称呼祂。这位来自摩押的女子，原本在神的圣约外，如今却认识了真神，并愿意敬拜祂。

> [!important]+ 反思与回应
我们所事奉的神，专门在绝望的境地中带来希望，只要祂的百姓肯回转归向祂。正如拿俄米最终回到了神的百姓和神应许的土地一样，我们也被呼召回到神面前，悔改、信靠、顺服神。当我们这样做时，祂必然信实地赦免我们，带给我们巨大的希望。今天，祈求你紧紧依靠神。如果你需要回到神的面前，就今天开始吧！

### <center>Return to God</center>

> [!question]+ Review
> 1. Whose birth is similar to Samson's in the Bible? What do these births have in common, and how do they demonstrate God's miraculous intervention and plan of salvation?
> 2. In Samson’s story, how does God use him to lead Israel temporarily out of the oppression of the Philistines? How do Samson's flaws impact his role in God's plan?
> 3. Why is Samson not able to be the eternal and just king over God's people? How should we, today, look forward to the ultimate Savior, Jesus Christ?

📖 **Passage to read**: ==Ruth 01==

> [!info]- 🎙️Audio: [A Daily Devotional - 03.29 - EN]()  

The first line of the book of Ruth doesn’t start with a lot of hope. It says, “In the days when the judges ruled” (1:1). This was a time when Israel had no king. There was no one leading the people to worship God, to follow Him, or to obey Him. Given all the sin and unrest in the land, can we expect anything good to come from a story that begins this way?

Ruth’s story starts with a bad decision. A man named Elimelech, along with his wife Naomi and their two sons, leave the promised land because of a famine. Why is this a bad decision? In a tough situation, Elimelech chooses to take his family away from God’s people and away from the land God had promised. To make matters worse, he takes them to Moab—a land that worships false gods and is an enemy of Israel. And it gets worse. Elimelech’s sons, Mahlon and Chilion, marry Moabite women: Orpah and Ruth. This decision leads them even farther away from God’s will, as they marry outside God’s covenant people. Could things get worse?

For Naomi, they did. While living in Moab, Naomi loses both her husband and her two sons to death. No wonder Naomi later says, “The hand of the LORD has gone out against me” (1:13). But here comes the surprising part. After Orpah agrees to Naomi’s request to return to Moab and find another husband, Ruth does the opposite. Ruth refuses to leave Naomi. She speaks these powerful words: “For where you go, I will go, and where you lodge, I will lodge. Your people shall be my people, and your God my God. Where you die, I will die, and there will I be buried” (1:16–17). Ruth doesn’t just choose Naomi; she also chooses the God of Israel, calling Him by name—Yahweh. This Moabite woman, from outside of God’s covenant people, has come to know and worship the true God.

> [!important]+ Reflect and Respond
We serve a God who specializes in turning hopeless situations into stories of hope, if His people will return to Him. Just as Naomi finally returned to God’s people and His promised land, we are called to return to God in repentance, trust, faith, and obedience. When we do, He will be faithful to forgive and bring us great hope. Pray today that you would cling to God. If you need to return to Him, do so today!
