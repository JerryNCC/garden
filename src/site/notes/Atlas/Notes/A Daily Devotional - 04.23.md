### <center>看见、犯罪、谋划</center>

> [!info]- 🎙️Audio: [A Daily Devotional - 04.23 - CN]()

大卫是一个合神心意的人，他是一位寻求荣耀神、为神的百姓行事的王。与为自己而活的扫罗不同，大卫一心为神的荣耀。然而，在《撒母耳记下》第十一章中，我们看到了一次令人震惊的转折。国家稳固，神所拣选的王正坐在宝座上，但即便是大卫，也陷入了罪中。

故事以一个微妙但重要的细节开始：“到了春天，正是列王出征打仗的时候”（11:1）。这为接下来的事件奠定了背景。大卫虽然拥有一支训练有素的军队，能够替他打仗，但他却选择留在耶路撒冷。这一刻标志着他堕落的开始。

接下来发生的事情源自一瞥。大卫看见了拔示巴，这一眼引发了他的更多注视，逐渐转化为欲望。欲望愈发强烈，他最终付诸行动。作为国王，大卫有能力召唤拔示巴，而当她怀孕后，事态急剧升温。

接下来，像我们所有人在犯错时常做的那样，大卫开始掩盖自己的罪行。他最初的计划不是谋杀，而是将拔示巴的丈夫乌利亚从战场上召回来。大卫希望乌利亚回家时能与妻子同房，这样就能让他成为怀孕孩子的父亲。然而，大卫没有预料到乌利亚的正直品格。乌利亚是个品德高尚的人，他拒绝在战时享受家庭的温暖，尤其是当其他战士都没有回家与妻子团聚时。大卫的计划因此被破坏，接下来的阴谋变得更加黑暗。

由于无法让事态平息，大卫安排乌利亚在战斗中处于孤立无援的状态。他被送到前线，敌军人数远超自己，最终乌利亚被杀。

故事以一个强烈且令人警醒的结语结束：“但大卫所做的事，耶和华甚为不悦”（11:27）。这提醒我们，无人能真正逃脱罪的审判，尽管我们可能一时以为自己逃避了。

> [!important]+ 反思与回应
在反思这个故事时，祈求神帮助你在与祂同行的道路上保持警醒。求神保护你的心，免受诱惑与罪的侵害。我们无法在今生达到完美，但借着圣灵的帮助，我们可以继续追随基督，活出圣洁。

> [!question]+ Review
> 1. What is the significance of God's promise to David in 2 Samuel 7? What connection is there between the temple that David’s descendants build and the eternal kingdom?
> 2. Why is the concept of "forever" so important in this passage? How does the temporary nature of David and Solomon's kingdom contrast with God's eternal promise?
> 3. How do you understand Jesus as the "descendant of David" bringing an eternal kingdom? What role does His sacrifice on the cross play in entering God's kingdom?

📖 **Passage to read**: ==2 Samuel 11==

> [!info]- 🎙️Audio: [A Daily Devotional - 04.23 - EN]()  

David was a man after God’s own heart, a king who sought to honor God and do what was right for His people. Unlike Saul, who lived for himself, David lived for God’s glory. But in 2 Samuel 11, we see a shocking turn of events. The kingdom is secure, God’s chosen king reigns, yet even David falls into sin.

The story begins with a subtle but important detail: “in the spring, at the time when kings go off to war” (11:1). This sets the stage for what follows. David, having a well-trained army, should have been leading them into battle. Instead, he stayed behind in Jerusalem. This moment marks the beginning of his downfall.

The events that follow begin with a simple glance. David saw Bathsheba, and that look led to another, and then to lust. His desire grew, and soon he acted on it. As king, he had the power to summon her, and when she became pregnant, the situation escalated.Now, like many of us when caught in sin, David tries to cover it up. His first plan isn’t to kill anyone but to bring Bathsheba’s husband, Uriah, home from the battlefield. David hopes Uriah will sleep with his wife, allowing him to take the blame for the pregnancy. But David didn’t anticipate Uriah’s integrity. Uriah, a man of great character, refuses to enjoy the comforts of home while his fellow soldiers are still at war. David’s plans are thwarted, and his schemes become darker.

Unable to make the situation go away, David arranges for Uriah to be left vulnerable in battle. He is sent to the front lines where the enemy forces overpower him, and Uriah is killed.

The passage ends with a powerful and sobering statement: “But the thing that David had done displeased the LORD” (11:27). This reminds us that no one truly gets away with sin, no matter how well they think they’ve hidden it.

> [!important]+ Reflect and Respond
As you reflect on this story, pray that God would help you remain vigilant in your walk with Him. Ask Him to protect your heart from temptation and sin. We will never be perfect, but with the Holy Spirit’s help, we can continue to pursue Christ and live in holiness.
