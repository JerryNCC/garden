### <center>不肯悔改</center>

> [!info]- 🎙️Audio: [None]()


从起初与祂子民的关系开始，神从未要求他们凭自己的力量达到完美。祂知道我们做不到。这正是耶稣——神的独生子——来到世上的原因，为的是赐下我们迫切所需的赦罪与公义。那神一贯向祂子民所要的是什么呢？很简单：悔改，并信靠祂。

然而，在耶利米的年代，神的百姓却拒绝了这两者。无论神怎样一再警告，差遣先知劝勉他们，他们依旧不肯回转。耶利米这样说：“你击打他们，他们却不伤恸；你毁灭他们，他们仍不受惩治。他们使脸刚硬过于磐石，不肯回头。”（耶5:3）神曾多次借着较轻的审判来唤醒他们，但他们执意偏行己路，不肯停下，不肯归回。

正因为如此，审判临到他们。罪确实是根源，但真正引发神审判的，是他们不肯悔改的顽梗。那是刚硬的心——冷漠、自高、不可动摇。因此神借耶利米警告他们：毁灭即将来临。庄稼将被毁，家园将被掳掠，外族将入侵这地，使以色列人沦为奴隶。那将是极其痛苦的日子，都是因为他们不肯悔改。

然而，就在这片黑暗之中，我们仍可瞥见神的怜悯。原本这一章可以满是审判——但事实并非如此。神说：“就是到那时，我也不将你们毁灭净尽。”（耶5:18）这是何等奇妙！神的百姓一次次地背叛祂，然而祂仍不愿灭尽他们。祂仍盼望他们回转，仍渴望教导他们。

> [!important]+ 反思与回应
那么，神今日向你要的是什么？仍是当年祂对祂百姓所要的：悔改与信靠。转离你的罪，将它坦然承认在神面前。为十字架感谢祂——因唯有借着耶稣的救赎，我们才得赦免。祈求祂赐你信心，使你越来越信靠祂。这信心也要借着顺服活出来——这是神呼召你所要走的道路。

### <center>Refused to Repent</center>

> [!question]+ Review
> 1.⁠ ⁠In Jeremiah 2:2, how does the Lord recall Israel’s “devotion of youth”? What kind of spiritual relationship is this verse trying to portray?
2.⁠ ⁠What metaphors does the prophet Jeremiah use to describe the rebellion of God’s people? What do these images reveal about their spiritual condition?
3.⁠ ⁠Why does God refuse to answer His people when they cry out in trouble? In today’s context, how can we avoid having a life that appears religious but is distant from God inwardly?

📖 **Passage to read**: ==Jeremiah 05.01-09==

> [!info]- 🎙️Audio: [None]()  

From the very beginning, God never asked his people to be perfect by their own strength. He knows we can’t do that. That’s why Jesus came—God’s own Son—to bring the forgiveness and righteousness we need so badly. What has God always wanted from his people? Simple: repentance and faith.

But in Jeremiah’s day, God’s people refused both. No matter how many times God warned them—no matter how many prophets he sent—they would not turn back. Jeremiah says it like this: “You have struck them down, but they felt no anguish; you have consumed them, but they refused to take correction. They have made their faces harder than rock; they have refused to repent” (5:3). God gave them many chances, smaller judgments meant to wake them up. But they kept going their own way. They wouldn’t stop. They wouldn’t turn back.

And that’s why judgment was coming. Yes, sin was the cause. But it was their refusal to repent that brought God’s hand down in full. Their hearts had become like stone—cold, proud, and unmovable. So God warned them through Jeremiah: destruction was coming. Their fields would be ruined. Their homes taken. Foreign armies would march in. Slavery, sorrow, and loss. All because they would not repent.

But even here, in the middle of all this darkness, we catch a glimpse of God’s mercy. This chapter could easily be all judgment—but it’s not. God says, “Even in those days, I will not make a full end of you” (5:18). That’s amazing. God’s people had turned from him again and again. Still, he would not wipe them out. He still wanted them to come back. He still wanted to teach them.

> [!important]+ Reflect and Respond
So what does God want from you? The same thing he wanted back then: repentance and faith. Turn from your sin. Talk to God about it. Thank him for the cross—for the forgiveness that only Jesus can give. And ask him for a heart that trusts him more and more. A heart that shows its love by walking in obedience. That’s the life God is calling you to.
