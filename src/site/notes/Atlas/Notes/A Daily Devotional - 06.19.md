### <center>你做了什么，约伯？</center>

> [!info]- 🎙️Audio: [A Daily Devotional - 06.19 - CN]()

今天，我们听到约伯的朋友以利法的第一次发言。他的话总结了约伯三位朋友的态度。核心意思很清楚：约伯一定做了什么错事，惹动了神的忿怒，否则这些灾难根本不会降临在他身上。以利法开始讲述他自己的经历，他说自己从未见过真正无辜的人遭遇这样的灾难。“你要思想，谁无辜灭亡呢？”（约伯记4:7）。虽然以利法承认约伯的行为正直，正如4章3至6节所描述的，但他坚信约伯生命中必有隐藏的罪，才导致这些苦难。最后，他提出了一个有力的问题：“人岂能在神面前成为完全吗？”（约伯记4:17）。他坚持认为，没有人，包括约伯，在神面前是完全清洁无罪的。

关于这一点，以利法说得对。除基督以外，没有人能在圣洁的神面前完全洁净公义。但以利法错在以为约伯的苦难是神因他隐藏的罪而惩罚他的。我们知道以利法不知道的真相：约伯并非因悖逆而受惩罚。恰恰相反，约伯因他对神的信心和顺服，才吸引了撒但的攻击。约伯的苦难是因为他是正直和忠心的，不是他失足跌倒。以利法显露出他的目光短浅，自以为明白神每次的作为，实际上并不了解。

对我们这些爱主、经历苦难的人来说，这是一份鼓励。以利法对苦难原因的判断是错误的。约伯的故事告诉我们，苦难也会降临在忠信的人身上，并非总是神的惩罚。但以利法和其他朋友也给了我们警戒：在试图解释神为何允许苦难时，要谨慎。因为他们心胸狭隘，得出了错误的结论。神的道路高过我们的道路，我们当信靠祂，任凭祂作主。

> [!important]+ 反思与回应
今天，就让我们祷告，求神帮助我们信靠祂为我们生命所定的美好计划。求祂赐力量，使我们即使在艰难时刻，也能坚守对耶稣的信心。记得，神为我们有永远的美意，即便现在生活充满困难。

### <center>What’d You Do, Job?</center>

> [!question]+ Review
> 1. ⁠Why does Job curse the day of his birth in the midst of his intense suffering? What does his lament reveal about his life condition?
> 2. How does Job maintain his faith in God during suffering while honestly expressing his struggles without doubting God's character?
> 3. After sitting in silence with his friends for seven days and nights, how does Job's lengthy monologue help us understand his inner pain and spiritual struggle?

📖 **Passage to read**: ==Job 04==

> [!info]- 🎙️Audio: [A Daily Devotional - 06.19 - EN]()  


Today, we hear the first speech from Job’s friend Eliphaz. His words sum up the attitude of all three of Job’s companions. The main idea is clear: Job must have done something wrong to make God angry. Otherwise, none of these terrible things would have happened to him. Eliphaz starts by sharing what he has seen in life. He says he has never witnessed such disaster come to a truly innocent person. “Remember,” he says, “who that was innocent ever perished?” (Job 4:7). Even though Eliphaz admits that Job lives righteously, as shown in verses 3–6, he firmly believes that some hidden sin in Job’s life is the cause of all this suffering. Eliphaz finishes with a strong question: “Can a man be pure before his Maker?” (4:17). He insists that no one, not even Job, is completely pure before God.

On this last point, Eliphaz is right. No one except Christ can be perfectly pure and right before a holy God. But Eliphaz is wrong to claim that Job’s suffering means God is punishing him for secret sin. We know something Eliphaz does not: Job is not being punished for rebellion. Instead, Job’s faithfulness and obedience to God have attracted Satan’s attacks. Job’s suffering comes because he has been faithful and upright, not because he has failed. Eliphaz shows us a man who is very short-sighted. He thinks he understands how God works every time, but he does not.

For those of us who love Jesus and face suffering, this is a hopeful reminder. Eliphaz is wrong about why suffering comes. Job’s story teaches us that suffering can come to the faithful, and it is not always God’s punishment. But Eliphaz and the other friends also give a warning: be careful when you try to explain why God allows suffering. Their closed minds led them to false conclusions. God’s ways are higher than ours, and we must trust Him to be God.

> [!important]+ Reflect and Respond
Today, pray that you will trust God’s perfect plan for your life. Ask Him to help you stay faithful to Jesus, even through hard times. Remember, God has good and eternal plans for you—even when life feels difficult now.
