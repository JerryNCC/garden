### <center>《士师记》中的循环</center>

> [!info]- 🎙️Audio: [A Daily Devotional - 03.21 - CN]()

当神的百姓未能完成祂交给他们的任务时，会发生什么？简而言之，接下来将是一系列的循环——这种反复的模式将贯穿整本《士师记》。这一循环在以色列人的生活中反复上演。

《士师记》第二章以耶和华的使者对百姓的严厉责备开始，指出他们未能完成征服的使命，也未能拆毁他们中间的偶像祭坛。百姓为此悔恨痛哭，向神献上祭物。紧接着，我们得知约书亚去世的消息，并看到一个新一代的兴起：“那一代人以后，又有一代人起来，不认识耶和华，也不晓得耶和华为以色列行过什么事” (2:10)。正是在这一时刻，《士师记》循环的第一个部分开始：百姓离弃神的敬拜，转而去崇拜偶像。

11至23节概述了一个将贯穿整本书的循环。它分为几个步骤。

第一步： 神的百姓离弃神，放弃顺服，开始敬拜周围民族的偶像。

第二步： 神因而管教祂的百姓，任凭敌人击败他们。

第三步： 百姓向神呼求怜悯，神出于恩典兴起一位士师，拯救他们脱离敌人。只要这位士师在世，百姓就得享平安。

然而，当士师去世后，循环再次开始——回到第一步。这是一个反复无常的罪恶故事。神的百姓似乎无法挣脱这一循环。但这也是神反复施行怜悯的故事。尽管百姓的顺服无法持久，神却通过士师一次次拯救他们。

《士师记》是一本悲伤的书，然而它并不缺乏希望。每一个士师的故事都带来一线光明——有些故事甚至是惊人的奇迹。然而，这些士师只是神百姓真正所需要的影像。他们不能继续在罪与偶像崇拜的循环中徘徊不前。神的百姓需要一位王。

> [!important]+ 反思与回应
当你阅读《士师记》时，请花些时间向神祈求，让祂让你看到你自己如何像那些顽固的以色列人一样。感谢神一次次地施行怜悯，差派士师拯救祂的百姓。更重要的是，感谢神为我们预备了终极的士师——那位能够打破罪的权势，释放我们脱离罪恶束缚的那位。

### <center>Cycling through Judges</center>

> [!question]+ Review
> 1. ⁠Why did the Israelites fail to complete the conquest? What consequences did this failure bring to them?
> 2. Why did God command His people to completely remove idolatry and sin? What spiritual significance lies behind this command?
> 3. How can we avoid tolerating sin and temptation in our lives? How can you maintain holiness and stay away from things that lead you away from God in your daily life?

📖 **Passage to read**: ==Judges 02==

> [!info]- 🎙️Audio: [A Daily Devotional - 03.21 - EN]()  

What happens when God’s people fail to finish the task He gave them? In short, what follows is a cycle—a repeating pattern that will define the book of Judges. Over and over again, this cycle plays out in the lives of the Israelites.

Judges 2 begins with a stern rebuke from the angel of the Lord, pointing out the people's failure to complete the conquest and to tear down the pagan altars around them. The people respond with regret, weeping and offering sacrifices to God. Then, right after this, we learn of Joshua’s death and the rise of a new generation: “And there arose another generation after them who did not know the LORD or the work that he had done for Israel” (2:10). It’s at this moment that the first part of the Judges cycle begins: the people turn away from worshiping God and start worshiping idols.

Verses 11–23 provide a summary of the cycle that will repeat itself throughout the book. It unfolds in a series of steps.

Step 1: God’s people turn away from Him, abandoning obedience, and begin to worship the idols of the surrounding nations.

Step 2: In response, God disciplines His people by allowing their enemies to defeat them in battle.
Step 3: The people cry out to God for mercy. In His grace, God raises up a judge to deliver them from their enemies, and there is peace as long as that judge remains alive.

Then the judge dies—and the cycle starts over with Step 1. It’s a story of repeated sin. God’s people just can’t seem to break free from the cycle. But it’s also a story of God’s relentless mercy. He repeatedly delivers His people through judges, even though their obedience doesn’t last.

Judges is a sad book, but it’s not without hope. Each story about a different judge brings moments of encouragement—and some even feature incredible feats. Yet, the judges themselves are only a faint picture of what God’s people truly need. They can’t keep going in circles, falling into sin and idolatry again and again. The people need a king.

> [!important]+ Reflect and Respond
As you read through Judges, take a moment to ask God to show you how you’re like the Israelites in their stubbornness. Thank Him for His repeated mercy in sending judges to deliver His people. And, most importantly, thank Him for offering us the ultimate Judge—the one who can break the power of sin and free us from its hold.
